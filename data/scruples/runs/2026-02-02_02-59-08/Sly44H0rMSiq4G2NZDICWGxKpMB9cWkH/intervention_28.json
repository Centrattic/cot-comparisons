When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the original post (OP) is in the wrong. The situation is about an inheritance from a \"play aunt,\" who left her property and money to the OP through the executor, who is their actual aunt. The play aunt's relatives are upset and might contest the will, but they haven't been close. The OP is considering keeping the inheritance despite the relatives' possible objections.\n\nFirst, the OP did help the play aunt over the years with chores, which the play aunt appreciated. The relatives weren't around much, so the OP's family took care of her needs. The will clearly states the OP as the beneficiary. Legally, if the will is valid, the OP has the right to the inheritance. The relatives contesting the will would depend on their relationship and the legal grounds, but if the will is properly executed, their chances might be slim. \n\nMorally, the OP is conflicted because they feel the relatives are upset but also that the play aunt's wishes should be respected. The husband says it's up to the OP. The key here is whether the OP is obligated to share the inheritance despite the will. Since the play aunt chose to leave it to them, especially after years of support, the OP isn't necessarily in the wrong. The relatives' absence and lack of involvement during the play aunt's life might justify her decision in the will. However, if the will's validity is questionable, the OP might need to consider that. But based on the information given, the will was executed, and the relatives haven't approached the OP directly. So, the OP isn't in the wrong for following the play aunt's wishes. Answer B."
