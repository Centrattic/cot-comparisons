When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance. The person is referred to as the author, and the context is that they received a bequest from a play aunt, who wasn't a blood relative. The play aunt had some relatives who aren't close and might contest the will. The author is being told by their actual aunt to keep everything, and their husband says it's up to them. The question is whether the author is in the wrong by just taking the inheritance.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. Since the will was made by the play aunt, and she had the right to leave her estate as she saw fit, legally the author is entitled to it. The relatives might contest the will, but if the will is valid, the author isn't breaking any laws by taking the inheritance. So legally, they might not be in the wrong.\n\nNext, the moral aspect. The author mentions that they didn't expect compensation for the help they provided over the years. They also note that the play aunt was nice to them as a kid and helped their kids. The fact that the author didn't expect payment could indicate that their relationship was based on mutual help and care, not an exchange for money. The play aunt's decision to leave her estate to them might be a sign of gratitude or affection. The relatives not being close and not visiting could support the idea that they weren't as involved in her life as the author and their aunt were. \n\nHowever, the author might face moral judgment from others who think they should share the inheritance with the relatives, especially if the relatives feel they are entitled. But the author's husband is supportive, and the actual aunt, as the executor, is advising them to keep it. The play aunt's relatives haven't contacted the author directly, which might mean they aren't as close as to have a claim. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author doesn't share anything, there could be a sense of ingratitude if the relatives were the only blood family. But the scenario states that the relatives weren't close and didn't visit much. The author provided significant support over the years, so the play aunt's decision could be seen as a way to thank them for their care.\n\nConsidering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They were chosen by the deceased to inherit, and their actions align with what the play aunt intended. The key points are the validity of the will, the relationship dynamics, and the lack of involvement from the relatives. Unless there's a legal issue with the will, the author isn't wrong for following the play aunt's wishes.\n"
