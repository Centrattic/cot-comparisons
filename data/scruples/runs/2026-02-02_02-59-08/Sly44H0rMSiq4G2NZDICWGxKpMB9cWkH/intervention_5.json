When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the scenario where they received an inheritance from a play aunt. The key points here are the relationships, the care provided, and the relatives' reaction.\n\nFirst, the author and their family provided regular help to the play aunt, like shoveling snow and cutting grass, which isn't a huge time commitment but shows some care. The play aunt wasn't very close to her own relatives, who haven't been around for years. The author's actual aunt is the executor and supports the author keeping the inheritance. The relatives are upset and might contest the will. The author is annoyed that the relatives are involved now after years of absence.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for accepting the inheritance. The will was made by the play aunt, so legally, the author has a right to it. However, the relatives might challenge it, but if the will is valid, their contesting may not hold. The author's argument is that the relatives weren't present when their aunt needed them, and the author's family was there. The husband says it's up to the author to decide.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author's family provided consistent support, which the play aunt appreciated. The relatives didn't contribute, so the play aunt's choice might be based on her own judgment. Since the will is clear, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
