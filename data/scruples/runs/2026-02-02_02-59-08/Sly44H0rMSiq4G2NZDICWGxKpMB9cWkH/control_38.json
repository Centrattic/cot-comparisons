When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not giving up the inheritance they received from their play aunt. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the play aunt wasn't a blood relative. The author and their actual aunt took care of the play aunt, doing chores like shoveling snow and mowing her lawn. They mention it wasn't much extra work since they were nearby. The author didn't expect compensation, but the play aunt left her estate to them. The play aunt's relatives are upset and might contest the will. The author is annoyed because these relatives weren't around much, and the play aunt spent holidays with the author's family.\n\nNow, the key points here are the relationship, the care provided, and the will's terms. The author and their family provided significant care without expecting payment. The play aunt's will was made with the author's actual aunt as the executor, who confirmed the author should keep the inheritance. The relatives haven't directly approached the author and are possibly contesting the will. \n\nLegally, if the will is valid and the author is the named beneficiary, they have a right to the inheritance. The relatives' potential contest depends on legal grounds, like if there was undue influence or if the will isn't valid. But the author isn't in the wrong unless they did something to alter the will or interfere. \n\nEthically, the author might feel conflicted because the relatives are unhappy, but the author and their family were the ones providing care. The play aunt's wishes were to leave things to the author, so honoring the will seems right. The author isn't obligated to give up the inheritance unless legally required. Since the relatives haven't approached the author directly, it's unclear how involved they are. The author isn't in a position to be blamed for following the will's instructions unless there's wrongdoing involved. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
