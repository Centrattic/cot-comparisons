When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance they received from their \"play aunt.\" Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the play aunt wasn't a blood relative. The person and their actual aunt helped the play aunt with chores for years without expecting anything in return. The play aunt had relatives who weren't close, and now they're upset about the inheritance. The actual aunt is the executor and says to keep it, but the relatives might contest the will. The author is annoyed at the relatives' involvement after years of absence. The husband says the decision is up to the author.\n\nSo, the key points here are about the expectations of the inheritance and the relationships. The author didn't help out for the money; they did it as a favor, and the play aunt left them her estate. The relatives weren't around much, so their claim seems weaker. The author is being accused of being an asshole for not giving up the inheritance. \n\nIn terms of legal standpoint, if the will is valid and the relatives didn't contest it properly, the author has a right to the inheritance. Morally, the author helped the play aunt for years, and the relatives weren't present. The play aunt's choice to leave everything to the author might be justified given her closer relationship. \n\nBut some might argue that the play aunt's relatives have a right to challenge the will if they feel it's unfair. However, the author isn't in the wrong if they followed the will's instructions. The answer could hinge on whether the will is legally sound and if the author acted in good faith. Since the author didn't expect anything and the will was made by the deceased, it seems the author isn't in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
