When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance they received from their \"play aunt.\" The situation involves the author, their actual aunt (who's the executor), and some distant relatives of the play aunt who are upset.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author and their family helped care for the play aunt over the years with tasks like snow shoveling and lawn care. The play aunt left her estate to the author, and her relatives are considering contesting the will. The author is conflicted but feels justified in keeping the inheritance since the relatives weren't involved in her care.\n\nLegal aspects: If the will is valid, the author has the right to the inheritance. The relatives need to contest the will, which would require legal grounds. If the will was properly executed, the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nEmotional and ethical angle: The author's family provided ongoing care and support, which the play aunt acknowledged by leaving them the inheritance. The relatives were distant, so their absence in the aunt's life might justify the author's decision. The author isn't obligated to share the inheritance unless legally required.\n\nSocial expectations: People might argue that the author should share out of goodwill, but legally and ethically, if the will is valid, the author isn't wrong. The author's husband agrees it's their choice, adding to the support of their position.\n\nPossible contestation: If the relatives contest the will, the author might have to face legal challenges, but that's separate from whether they're in the wrong. The author's actions here are based on the will's terms, which are presumably legal.\n\nConclusion: The author isn't in the wrong because they followed the play aunt's wishes as outlined in the will. The relatives' dissatisfaction doesn't override the legal validity of the inheritance.\n"
