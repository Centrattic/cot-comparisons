When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. Let me try to break it down.\n\nFirst, the setup: The author helped care for their \"play aunt\" over the years, doing chores like shoveling snow and cutting grass. The play aunt wasn't a blood relative but was close to the author's actual aunt. The author didn't expect anything in return because the play aunt was nice to them as a kid and helped their kids with things like college letters. Now, the play aunt has passed, and the author's actual aunt is the executor. The play aunt left her property and money to the author, which isn't a huge amount but includes her home, car, and life insurance. The play aunt's relatives are unhappy and might contest the will. The author is conflicted but leaning towards keeping the inheritance since the relatives weren't around much. The husband says it's up to the author, so the question is whether the author is in the wrong by keeping it.\n\nSo, the key points here are about whether the author is morally or ethically in the wrong by not giving up the inheritance. The author didn't expect compensation, but the play aunt chose to leave it to them. The relatives are upset, but they weren't close. The author feels justified because they provided care and the relatives weren't present.\n\nLegally, if the will is valid and the play aunt had the mental capacity to make it, the author is the rightful heir. The relatives contesting might not have a strong legal case unless there's evidence of undue influence or fraud, which the author doesn't mention. So legally, the author might be in the right.\n\nMoral or ethical considerations: The author helped out for years, and the play aunt appreciated them enough to leave her estate to them. The relatives weren't involved, so maybe the play aunt's decision was intentional. The author isn't obligated to give up what was left to them unless there's a moral obligation they feel towards the relatives. Since the relatives weren't part of the play aunt's life recently, the author's annoyance is understandable.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer would depend on whether the author had an obligation to the relatives despite the will. Since the play aunt made the decision, and the author didn't act improperly, it's more likely that the author isn't in the wrong. The answer is B for No.\n"
