When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe author is asking if they would be a \"WIBTA\" (Would I Be A Twit/Asshole) if they didn't give up the inheritance they received from their \"play aunt.\" The play aunt isn't a blood relative but was close to the author's actual aunt, who is the executor of the estate. The author and their family used to help the play aunt with chores like shoveling snow and cutting grass, which they did without expecting payment. The play aunt had a will that left her property and money to the author. However, the play aunt's relatives, who weren't close to her, are upset about this and might contest the will. The author is annoyed that these relatives are now involved, especially since they weren't around for the play aunt's life. The husband says it's up to the author to decide, but the author is questioning if they're being an asshole by keeping the inheritance.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points:\n\n1. The author and their family helped the play aunt with various tasks over the years without expecting payment.\n2. The play aunt left her estate to the author through her will.\n3. The play aunt's relatives are not close and haven't been involved in her life recently, but they're upset and might contest the will.\n4. The author is considering keeping everything as per the will, but the relatives are now involved.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong for following the will's instructions and keeping the inheritance despite the relatives' objections.\n\nLet me think about the legal and ethical aspects here. Legally, if the will is valid and the relatives are contesting it, the author might be within their rights to keep the inheritance. However, contesting a will can be possible if there's evidence of undue influence, lack of capacity, or other legal grounds. But since the author hasn't heard the contesting from the relatives directly, maybe they're just upset but not legally justified.\n\nEthically, the author's family provided services to the play aunt, which could be seen as a form of compensation, but the author didn't expect payment. The play aunt's relatives weren't close, so maybe their claim is weaker. The author's annoyance at the relatives' involvement makes sense given their lack of presence in the play aunt's life.\n\nHowever, the relatives might still feel entitled, especially if they're blood relations. But the play aunt chose to leave her estate to someone who was present and helpful, which could be seen as reasonable. The key here is whether the play aunt had the right to leave her estate to the author, and if the author is morally obligated to share it despite the will's terms.\n\nAnother angle: the author's actual aunt is the executor and supports the author keeping the inheritance. The relatives haven't approached the author directly, only the executor, which might indicate they're not serious about contesting. The author might be right to follow the will unless there's a legal challenge.\n\nIn terms of being an \"asshole,\" it depends on the author's intent. If they're keeping the inheritance as per the will, which the play aunt presumably intended, then they're not in the wrong. The relatives' objections might be based on their own expectations, not the play aunt's actual wishes. The author's actions align with the deceased's final wishes, which is generally respected.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong (Answer B). They followed the will's instructions, the relatives weren't close, and the author's family provided care. Unless there's a legal issue with the will, the author has the right to the inheritance.\n"
