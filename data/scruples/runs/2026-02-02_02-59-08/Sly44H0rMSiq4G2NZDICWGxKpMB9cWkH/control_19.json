When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not giving up the inheritance they received from their \"play aunt.\" The situation is a bit complicated, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the key facts: The author's actual aunt is the executor of the play aunt's estate. The play aunt isn't a blood relative but was close to the author's family. The author and their family helped take care of the play aunt by doing chores like shoveling snow and mowing the lawn. The play aunt left her property and money to the author, which includes her home, car, and life insurance. The play aunt's relatives are upset and might contest the will, but they weren't close to her. The author is considering keeping the inheritance, and the husband says it's up to them.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong by following the will's instructions. To determine this, I need to consider legal and ethical aspects. Legally, if the will is valid, the author has the right to the inheritance. The relatives contesting might not have a strong case if the will was properly executed. Ethically, the author's family provided care and support to the play aunt, and she expressed her wishes in the will. The relatives weren't involved, which complicates their claim morally.\n\nThe author might feel justified in keeping the inheritance since the play aunt chose them, and the family provided care. The relatives' potential contest might not be legally valid if the will isn't flawed. The author isn't obligated to give anything to the relatives unless the will is successfully contested, which isn't clear here.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because they're following the play aunt's wishes as stated in the will, especially given the long-term support provided. The relatives' objections might not hold weight both legally and ethically. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
