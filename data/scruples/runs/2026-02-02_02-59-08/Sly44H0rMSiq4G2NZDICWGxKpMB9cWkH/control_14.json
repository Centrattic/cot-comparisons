When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about an inheritance from a \"play aunt,\" who isn't a blood relative. The author and their actual aunt were helping the play aunt with tasks like shoveling snow and cutting grass for years. The actual aunt is the executor of the play aunt's estate and informed the author that they were left the property and money. The play aunt's relatives are upset and might contest the will, but they haven't been around much.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If the play aunt legally willed her assets to the author, then the author is within their rights to keep it. The relatives can contest the will, but unless there's some legal issue like undue influence or the will isn't valid, the author isn't breaking any laws by following the will's instructions. So legally, the author isn't in the wrong.\n\nThen there's the moral side. The author didn't expect compensation for the help they provided, but the play aunt chose to leave them her inheritance. The author feels annoyed that the relatives are now involved, given that they weren't around much. The author is considering giving them family pictures but not the money or property. The husband says it's up to the author. \n\nMoral judgments here are tricky. The relatives might feel entitled, but if they weren't close and didn't help care for the play aunt, maybe it's fair for her to choose someone closer to her. The author's family was there for her, so the play aunt's decision could be seen as a thank you. However, some might argue that even if the relatives were distant, they still might have a claim. But the author isn't in the wrong if the will is valid and they followed her explicit wishes. The key is that the play aunt had the right to decide her heirs. The author isn't obligated to share unless they want to. So morally, unless there's a specific ethical code they're violating (like a promise to share), the author isn't wrong for keeping what was intended for them.\n"
