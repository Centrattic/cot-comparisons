When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario involves an inheritance from a \"play aunt\" who wasn't a blood relative. The author and their actual aunt helped the play aunt with chores over the years. Now, the play aunt left her estate to the author, but her relatives are upset and might contest the will.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author didn't expect compensation for their help, and the play aunt had a relationship with them. The relatives weren't close, and the author feels annoyed that they're involved now. The husband says it's up to the author to decide, but the author is considering keeping everything as per the will.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate. \n\nLegal perspective: If the will is valid, the author is entitled to the inheritance. The relatives contesting might not have a strong case unless there's evidence of undue influence or the will is invalid. But the author isn't legally obligated to give anything back unless the court rules otherwise.\n\nMoral perspective: The author helped the play aunt for years without expecting payment. The play aunt chose to leave the inheritance to the author, which might be a gesture of gratitude. The relatives weren't involved, so the author has a valid emotional connection. However, some might argue that the relatives have a right to their inheritance if that's what the play aunt intended. But if the will is clear, the author is following the play aunt's wishes.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the relatives talked to the actual aunt, not them, so maybe they're not in a position to contest effectively. The author's annoyance is understandable given the long-term relationship versus the distant relatives.\n\nSo, considering both legal and moral aspects, the author isn't in the wrong. They're choosing to honor the play aunt's wishes and their own relationship. The relatives' potential contest might not hold up, especially if the will is properly executed. Therefore, the answer should be B (not in the wrong).\n"
