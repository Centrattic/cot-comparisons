When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is being offered an inheritance from a \"play aunt\" through their actual aunt, who is the executor. The key points here are that the author and their family did extra work for the play aunt over the years, and the author didn't expect anything in return. The play aunt's relatives are upset but weren't close to her.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not giving up the inheritance. The author feels justified because they provided care and the relatives weren't around. The husband supports the author's decision. The relatives might contest the will, but the author wasn't involved in those conversations.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author probably isn't in the wrong. The play aunt was close to them and their family, and the author's family helped her when others didn't. The relatives weren't present, so maybe the play aunt felt the author was more deserving. Legally, if the will is valid and the executor is following it, the author has a right to the inheritance. So, the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
