When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves an inheritance from a \"play aunt\" who wasn't blood-related. The main points are:\n\n1. The writer and their family did small favors for the play aunt over the years, like shoveling snow and cutting grass. It wasn't much work, maybe 20-30 minutes extra. They didn't expect anything in return.\n\n2. The play aunt's actual relatives weren't close to her. They didn't visit much, and she spent most holidays with the writer's family. Now the relatives are upset about the inheritance and might contest the will.\n\n3. The writer is being told by their actual aunt (the executor) to just keep everything. The husband says it's up to the writer. The question is whether the writer is in the wrong if they decide to keep the inheritance as per the will.\n\nFirst, legally, if the will is valid and the relatives haven't successfully contested it, the writer isn't in the wrong. The relatives' dissatisfaction doesn't automatically make the writer wrong unless there's a legal issue with the will. The writer had no obligation to the play aunt's blood relatives since they weren't part of the relationship. \n\nMoral considerations: The writer did help out the play aunt and their own aunt, but didn't expect compensation. The play aunt chose to leave her estate to them, which might be a token of gratitude. The relatives weren't involved in her daily life, so maybe the writer has a stronger claim morally. \n\nThe key here is that the will reflects the play aunt's wishes. Unless there's evidence of undue influence or other issues, the writer isn't in the wrong by following her wishes. The relatives' potential contest is their issue, not the writer's fault. Also, the writer isn't responsible for the relatives' absence; they had their chance to be close and didn't. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No), the writer isn't in the wrong. They're honoring the play aunt's wishes, and the relatives' actions are their own. The writer isn't obligated to share unless legally required, which the scenario doesn't indicate.\n"
