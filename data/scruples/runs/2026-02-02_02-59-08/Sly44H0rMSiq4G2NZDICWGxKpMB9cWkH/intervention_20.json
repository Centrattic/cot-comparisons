When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance they received from a \"play aunt.\" The key points here are the relationships, the actions taken by the author and their family, and the relatives' reactions.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that they and their actual aunt took care of the play aunt for years, doing tasks like shoveling snow and mowing the lawn. They didn't expect payment, but the play aunt left her property and money to the author. The relatives are upset and considering contesting the will. The author is annoyed because the relatives weren't around much, and the play aunt spent most holidays with their family.\n\nThe main issue is whether the author should have given part of the inheritance to the play aunt's relatives. The author's husband says it's up to them. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to determine if that's accurate.\n\nIn terms of legal aspects, if the will is valid and the relatives aren't contesting it successfully, the author is legally entitled to the inheritance. However, morally or socially, the author might feel pressure to share, especially if the relatives were blood relations. But the play aunt isn't a blood relative, and the author's family provided care. The relatives weren't involved, so the author might feel justified in following the will's instructions.\n\nThe author's annoyance and the relatives' potential contestation complicate things. If the relatives are contesting the will, maybe there's more to the story, like previous agreements or estrangement. But the user's question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, if the will is valid, the author isn't in the wrong. Socially, it's a gray area. The author did take care of the play aunt, so their claim to the inheritance is strong. The relatives not being around much could support the author's decision.\n\nSo considering all that, the answer is probably B (not in the wrong). The author followed the play aunt's wishes, and since they provided care, it's reasonable they receive the inheritance. The relatives' contestation doesn't negate the author's right if the will is valid.\n"
