When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance they received from the \"play aunt.\" The situation involves the author's actual aunt being the executor and informing them that the play aunt left her property and money to them. The play aunt's relatives are upset and considering contesting the will, but they haven't been around for years.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If the will is valid and the play aunt legally willed her assets to the author, then the author has a right to inherit. The relatives talking about contesting might be just empty threats unless there's a valid legal reason. So legally, the author might not be in the wrong here.\n\nNext, the moral angle. The author mentions that they didn't expect any compensation for helping the play aunt and that the relatives weren't close. The author's family had a long-standing relationship with the play aunt, even helping her out. The play aunt was nice to them as a kid and helped with their kids. So, from a moral standpoint, the author might feel justified in keeping the inheritance since the play aunt clearly intended to leave it to them. The relatives not being around during her life could argue that they didn't contribute or maintain a relationship, which might affect their moral claim.\n\nAnother point is the husband's advice. He says it's up to the author to decide, which suggests that there's no obligation felt by their immediate family to give it up. The author's annoyance at the relatives' involvement now might indicate that they feel the relatives have no right to intervene after being absent for so long.\n\nHowever, could the author be in the wrong if the relatives have a legitimate claim? If the will is contested successfully, the author might have to return the inheritance, which could lead to legal issues. But if the will is valid, then the author isn't in the wrong. The key here is the validity of the will and the relationship dynamics. The author's family had a close relationship, while the relatives were distant. The play aunt's intentions, as expressed in the will, seem clear. \n\nIn conclusion, considering both legal and moral aspects, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They followed the play aunt's wishes as per the will, and the relatives' lack of involvement might weaken their claim. The answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
