When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not giving up the inheritance they received from the \"play aunt.\" The situation involves family dynamics and legal aspects.\n\nFirst, the play aunt isn't a blood relative. She left her estate to the author, and the author's actual aunt, who is the executor, thinks they should keep it. However, the play aunt's relatives are upset and might contest the will. The author feels annoyed because these relatives weren't around for years, and the play aunt spent time with them instead.\n\nLegally, if the will is valid, the author has the right to the inheritance. The relatives would need to prove the will was made under undue influence or was invalid. Since the author didn't expect compensation for the help they provided, but the play aunt chose to leave them the inheritance, that's her decision. The author isn't obligated to share unless there's a legal challenge or moral obligation.\n\nMorally, the author might feel conflicted, but the play aunt's wishes should be respected. The relatives not being involved doesn't negate the author's right if the will is valid. The husband's advice to decide based on personal choice makes sense. So, unless the will is contested successfully, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
