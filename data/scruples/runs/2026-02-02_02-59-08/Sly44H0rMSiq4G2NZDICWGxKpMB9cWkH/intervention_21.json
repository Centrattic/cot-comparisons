When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be A Total Asshole?) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves an inheritance from a \"play aunt\" who isn't a blood relative. The author and their family did some chores for the play aunt over the years, like shoveling snow and cutting grass, which wasn't much extra work. The play aunt left her estate to the author's actual aunt, who is the executor, and the aunt wants the author to keep everything. However, the play aunt's relatives are upset and might contest the will.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If the will is valid and the play aunt clearly left everything to the actual aunt (who then passed it on to the author), then legally, the author has a right to the inheritance. The relatives haven't contested it yet, so unless they can prove the will is invalid, there's no legal issue. Legally, the author is in the right here.\n\nThen there's the moral and ethical side. The key points are: the author and their family provided services without expecting payment, the play aunt was close to them and not to her own relatives, and the relatives weren't around. The author feels they're being fair because they've given the relatives family pictures but not the money or property. The husband says it's up to the author. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for keeping the inheritance. The main factors are the intent of the play aunt, the actions of the author's family, and the relatives' potential claims. The author didn't do anything to prevent the relatives from being involved; they were just not around. The play aunt's will reflects her wishes, and if she wanted the author to have it, she had the right to do so. The relatives' annoyance might be about their own neglect, not the author's actions. The author isn't taking anything they weren't left, so even if the relatives contest, unless they win, the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They're following the will's instructions, and the relatives' dissatisfaction stems from their own lack of involvement, not the author's actions.\n"
