When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for Accepting an Inheritance) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's \"play aunt\" who was not a blood relative. They helped take care of her by doing chores, and she left them an inheritance. The actual aunt is the executor and wants the author to keep it, but the play aunt's relatives are upset and might contest the will.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If the will is valid and legally binding, then the author is entitled to the inheritance. The relatives contesting it would have to go through legal channels. If the will was properly executed with witnesses and all legal formalities, the author has a right to it. However, if the relatives can prove the will was made under undue influence or fraud, that's a different story. But the post doesn't mention any such issues, just that they're unhappy.\n\nThen there's the moral aspect. The author mentions they didn't expect compensation and the play aunt was helpful to their family. The relatives weren't close, and the play aunt spent more time with the author's family. The author feels annoyed that the relatives are now involved after being absent for years. The husband says it's up to them to decide if they want to give anything to the relatives. The author is considering just obeying the play aunt's wishes.\n\nThe key points here are: the will's validity, the relatives' relationship with the deceased, and the author's intentions. If the will is valid, the author isn't in the wrong for accepting it. The relatives not being close and not being involved in the care of the play aunt might support the author's decision. But if the relatives have a legal claim and the will is contested successfully, maybe the author could be seen as acting against their interest. However, the author isn't obligated to act against the deceased's wishes unless legally required. Since the actual aunt is the executor, she's responsible for handling the estate, and the author isn't the one making decisions about the will's distribution. The author is just being informed they're the beneficiary.\n\nIn terms of moral judgment, the author's actions seem justified. They provided care, the deceased expressed her wishes in the will, and the relatives weren't present. The author isn't in the wrong for accepting what was left to them unless there's a legal issue. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
