When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about an inheritance from a \"play aunt\" who wasn't a blood relative. The author and their actual aunt helped take care of the play aunt by doing chores like shoveling snow and cutting grass. They mention it wasn't a lot of extra work and they didn't expect compensation. Now the play aunt left her property and money to the author through the actual aunt being the executor. The play aunt's relatives are upset and considering contesting the will, but they haven't been around much.\n\nThe author is conflicted about whether they should keep the inheritance or give some to the relatives. Their husband says it's up to them. The question is whether the author is in the wrong if they choose to keep it all as per the will.\n\nFirst, legally, if the will is valid and properly executed, the author isn't in the wrong for following it. The relatives would need a legal reason to contest the will, which might be hard if the will was properly drawn up and the play aunt had the mental capacity to make it. The fact that the relatives weren't close and didn't help out might support the author's position.\n\nMoral arguments could go either way. The author helped the play aunt for years without expecting payment, and the play aunt left her inheritance to them, perhaps as a token of appreciation. The relatives not being involved might mean they have less claim. On the other hand, if the will was made without proper legal formalities or the play aunt was unduly influenced, that could be an issue. However, the author doesn't mention any such issues, just that the relatives are upset.\n\nThe author's annoyance at the relatives' involvement now might be justified if they truly neglected the play aunt. The key here is whether the will is valid and if the author has a moral obligation beyond that. Since the author's actions are based on the will's terms and their own history of support, it seems they are not in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
