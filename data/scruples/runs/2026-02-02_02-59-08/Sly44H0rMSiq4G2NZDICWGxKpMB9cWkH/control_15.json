When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance they received from their \"play aunt,\" who wasn't a blood relative but was close to their actual aunt. The key points here are the relationship dynamics, the care provided, and the will's terms.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that they and their family helped maintain the play aunt's property over the years, like shoveling snow and mowing the lawn. It wasn't a huge effort since they lived nearby, and they didn't expect payment. The play aunt was nice to them as a kid and helped with college stuff for their kids. So there's a history of mutual support and kindness.\n\nThe actual aunt is the executor and informed the author that the play aunt left her estate to them. The relatives are upset and might contest the will. But the author knows these relatives weren't close, and the play aunt spent holidays with the author's family. The husband says it's up to the author to decide whether to share the inheritance.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong by keeping the inheritance as per the will's wishes. The play aunt's will is a legal document, and if it's valid, the author has the right to the inheritance. The relatives' potential contesting isn't a valid reason for the author to give up what they were legally left, especially if the will was properly executed. \n\nHowever, there's a moral consideration. The author might feel a sense of obligation to the distant relatives, but given that those relatives weren't present in the play aunt's life, while the author's family was, it's a bit of a gray area. But legally, the author isn't in the wrong. The play aunt had the right to leave her estate as she wished, and the author has fulfilled the wishes of the deceased. So, the answer would be B, no, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
