When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance they received. \n\nFirst, the key points: The person's \"play aunt\" left them her property and money via her will. The play aunt wasn't a blood relative but had a close relationship with both the author and the author's actual aunt. They helped each other with chores and the play aunt was nice to the author as a kid and helped the author's kids. The play aunt's other relatives are upset and might contest the will, but they weren't close to her and didn't visit much. The author's own aunt (the executor) is telling them to keep the inheritance, but the author is conflicted because the other relatives are upset.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong for keeping the inheritance. Legally, if the will is valid and the relatives haven't successfully contested it, the author has the right to keep it. In terms of moral or ethical considerations, the relatives weren't close to the play aunt and didn't contribute to her care. The author and their family were the primary caregivers and had a long-standing relationship. The play aunt's wishes were clear in the will, and the author is respecting her wishes by keeping the inheritance. The author also mentions they would share family pictures, showing some consideration for the relatives' feelings.\n\nThe husband's advice that it's up to the author to decide supports the idea that it's their choice. The fact that the relatives haven't approached the author directly but instead discussed it with the aunt might indicate their lack of seriousness in contesting. The author's annoyance at the relatives' involvement is understandable given their lack of presence in the play aunt's life.\n\nSo, legally and ethically, the author isn't in the wrong. They're honoring the play aunt's wishes and the relatives' potential contest doesn't change that. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
