When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance they received from a \"play aunt.\" The play aunt wasn't blood-related but was close to their actual aunt. They helped both aunts with chores, which wasn't much work, and the play aunt left them stuff. The relatives are upset and might contest the will. The user feels annoyed because they weren't around much.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The will was written by the play aunt, and she chose to leave her assets to the user. Unless the relatives can prove the will is invalid (like undue influence, lack of mental capacity, etc.), the user is legally within their rights to keep it. The relatives haven't contacted the user directly, just expressed their intent to contest to the executor (actual aunt). So legally, the user isn't in the wrong.\n\nEthically, it's trickier. The user was helping out a lot, and the play aunt was close to them. The relatives were distant. The user might feel they've earned the inheritance through their support over the years. But others might argue that the relatives have a right to inherit if they're next of kin. However, the user's actions were based on the play aunt's wishes, and she had the autonomy to choose her beneficiaries. Since the user didn't manipulate the will, they're acting according to the deceased's intent.\n\nAlso, the user is not obligated to share with the relatives unless the will contest is successful. The husband's advice that it's up to the user to decide aligns with personal choice here. The user's annoyance is understandable given the relatives' lack of prior involvement. So, ethically, it's a personal decision but not wrong.\n\nSo, answer B: No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
