When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance they received. The author's \"play aunt\" left them her property and money through her actual aunt, who's the executor. The play aunt's relatives are upset and might contest the will, but they hadn't been close for years. The author and their family had helped the play aunt with chores, and the author didn't expect payment. The husband says it's up to the author to decide.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If the will was properly executed and the author is named as a beneficiary, they're legally entitled to the inheritance. The relatives wanting to contest it would depend on their relationship and whether they could prove the will was invalid. But since the author's actual aunt is the executor, and she's telling the author to keep it, that's a strong legal indicator.\n\nThen there's the moral side. The author helped the play aunt without expecting anything. The relatives weren't around, so the author feels justified in keeping the inheritance. The husband supports the author's decision. The key points are the play aunt's wishes (as per the will), the relatives' lack of involvement, and the author's prior help. \n\nThe author isn't obligated to share unless the will is contested and proven invalid. Since the relatives haven't approached the author directly and the will is in place, the author is acting within their rights. The relatives' potential contest doesn't change that unless it's successful, which is uncertain. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for following the play aunt's wishes as stated in the will. The answer should be B.\n"
