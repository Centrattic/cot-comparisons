Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is wrong for telling their 4-year-old daughter that it's okay to push away another kid who's hugging and kissing her too forcefully. The parent argues that it's legitimate self-defense when the other child won't stop despite the daughter's protests. The spouse disagrees, saying it's better to go to the teachers and avoid violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. Four years old is very young, and their understanding of right and wrong is still developing. The parent is teaching the child to use physical force to protect herself, which could be seen as teaching self-defense, but also as encouraging aggression. \n\nThe situation is that the other child's behavior is uncomfortable and potentially inappropriate. The daycare staff aren't effectively addressing it. The daughter is being taught to push back if necessary, but the parent emphasizes that it's only in cases of \"legit violence.\" The spouse is concerned that teaching a child to use force sets a bad example and might escalate the situation.\n\nOn one hand, it's important to teach a child to protect themselves from unwanted physical contact, especially if it's making them uncomfortable. On the other hand, encouraging a 4-year-old to push another child might not be the best approach because they might not understand the nuances of when to use force and when not to. There's also the risk that the child could overreact or use more force than necessary, leading to more conflict.\n\nAnother angle is the daycare's role. The parent mentioned that the teachers aren't seeing the incidents. The spouse's approach is to rely on the adults to handle it, which might be more appropriate in a structured environment. However, if the teachers aren't effective, the parent has to find another way to protect their child.\n\nThe key here is whether the parent's advice is proportionate and age-appropriate. Teaching a child to use physical force only as a last resort and to seek help if needed might be reasonable. But since the child is very young, the parent might be overestimating her ability to judge the situation correctly. There's a balance between teaching self-advocacy and avoiding aggression.\n\nPossible issues include the child learning that physical force is a valid response to any uncomfortable situation, even if it's not violence. Also, the other child might retaliate, as the daughter feared, leading to more problems. The parent's approach could lead to a cycle of conflict rather than teaching the child to communicate or seek help.\n\nIn conclusion, while the parent's intention is to protect the child from unwanted contact, the method might not be the best for a 4-year-old. The spouse's concern about teaching non-violent solutions and relying on adults is valid. The parent might be in the wrong for encouraging physical intervention, even if it's for self-defense, due to the child's age and the potential for escalation. So, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
