Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for telling their 4-year-old to push away another kid who's hugging/kissing her too roughly and not stopping when she yells. The parent argues that it's legitimate self-defense, while the SO thinks it's better to teach non-violence and report to teachers.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. At 4, kids are still learning social boundaries and how to handle conflicts. The parent is addressing a specific situation where the other child is being aggressive and not respecting the daughter's signals to stop. The parent's advice is about using physical force to defend herself in a situation where she's being uncomfortably touched. \n\nOn one hand, teaching a child to use physical force could be seen as promoting violence, even if it's in self-defense. It might set a precedent where the child learns to respond with aggression instead of words or seeking help. However, the parent is emphasizing \"legit force\" in a specific context where the other child is being violent and not heeding the daughter's protests. The parent also added a follow-up about pushing back or running away and telling an adult if the other child retaliates.\n\nOn the other hand, the SO's concern is valid too. Teaching non-violence and problem-solving through communication is important, especially at a young age. The fact that the teachers aren't noticing the issue despite the daughter reporting it suggests there might be a need for better adult supervision or strategies to address the behavior of the other child. The parent might be compensating for the lack of adult intervention by giving their daughter a way to protect herself.\n\nBut is teaching a 4-year-old to push someone away appropriate? Maybe in this context where the other child is being overly aggressive and not respecting personal space. The parent isn't encouraging general violence but specific actions in a specific situation. The key here is whether the parent's advice is reasonable given the circumstances. The child is old enough to understand the difference between playful and harmful actions, as the parent mentions.\n\nAnother angle is the child's own safety. If the daughter is in a situation where she's being physically forced and the adults aren't stopping it, it's important she has tools to protect herself. Pushing away might be a necessary self-defense mechanism in that case. However, the parent should also reinforce reporting the behavior and not just relying on physical responses. The answer might depend on balancing both teaching self-defense and proper conflict resolution.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the parent isn't entirely in the wrong. They're addressing an immediate safety concern for their child in a scenario where other methods (telling adults) aren't working. The advice is specific and situational, not a general endorsement of violence. Therefore, the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong).\n"
