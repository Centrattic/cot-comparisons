Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for telling their 4-year-old to push away another kid who's hugging and kissing her too forcefully. The parent is talking to their daughter about using force if the other child won't stop even after she yells. The spouse thinks they should just tell the teachers and not use violence at all.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the child's age. At 4, kids are still learning social boundaries and how to handle conflicts. The other child is being physically aggressive, which is a problem. The parent is trying to teach their daughter self-defense, but the spouse is concerned about encouraging violence.\n\nThe parent argues that it's legitimate force in a situation where the child is being forced. But 4-year-olds might not fully understand the difference between appropriate and inappropriate force. If the daughter pushes back, there's a risk the other child might react violently, as the daughter herself feared. Also, the school might have different policies on how they handle such situations. The parent did tell the daughter to run and tell an adult if needed, which combines both immediate action and seeking help.\n\nBut maybe the right approach is to reinforce non-violent methods first, like teaching the child to say no firmly, using personal space, and consistently reporting to adults. The parent's advice could escalate the situation or lead to the daughter using more force than necessary. However, given that the teachers aren't effective and the other child isn't listening, the parent is trying to protect their daughter's well-being.\n\nThere's a balance between teaching self-advocacy and avoiding violence. The parent's advice might be seen as justified because it's about personal safety, but the spouse's concern about violence in children is valid. The key is whether the parent's advice is age-appropriate and if there are better non-violent strategies they could have suggested.\n\nI think the parent isn't entirely wrong because they're addressing their daughter's immediate discomfort and safety. However, the approach might not be the best. Encouraging a 4-year-old to push someone could lead to more conflict. The correct answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there's nuance here. Maybe the parent should have focused more on communication and reporting, but since the teachers aren't helping, they're trying an alternative method. So, the answer is B.\n"
