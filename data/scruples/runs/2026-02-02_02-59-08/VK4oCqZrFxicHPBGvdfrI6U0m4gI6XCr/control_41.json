Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent is wrong for teaching their 4-year-old to push away another kid who's hugging and kissing her violently. The parent's reasoning is that the other child isn't stopping even when the daughter yells, and the teachers aren't effective. The spouse disagrees, saying to avoid violence.\n\nFirst, considering the child's safety. At 4, kids might not fully understand personal boundaries or how to handle aggressive peers. If the other kid is using force and not respecting her refusal, the parent wants to empower her to protect herself. But teaching a child to use physical force could lead to more violence or escalate the situation. However, in this case, it's about preventing harm from another child, so it's a form of self-defense.\n\nThe parent isn't advocating for random violence but situational defense. The daughter already tried telling teachers without success. The parent's advice seems to be about immediate self-protection when other methods fail. The spouse's concern is valid about using violence, but the parent's approach is to teach a necessary boundary.\n\nOn the other hand, using force might be inappropriate for such a young child. They might not differentiate between appropriate and excessive force. Also, the daycare's role is to manage interactions, so maybe the parent should push harder for the daycare to address the issue, like changing groups or involving child services if necessary.\n\nBut given the daycare's lack of action, the parent's intention is to protect their child. The advice is specific to a harmful situation, not encouraging violence. The parent is teaching the child to recognize and respond to unwanted physical contact, which is a safety measure. So, the parent isn't in the wrong because they're responding to a clear safety concern with a practical solution when other methods have failed.\n"
