Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation involves a 4-year-old daughter who's being hugged too forcefully and kissed by another kid at daycare. The parent told the daughter it's okay to push the other kid away if he's being violent and not stopping even when she yells. The spouse disagrees, saying it's better to tell the teachers and avoid violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. At 4 years old, kids are still learning how to handle social interactions and boundaries. Teaching a child to use physical force, even in self-defense, might not be the best approach. It could escalate the situation or lead to the other child retaliating. The parent is right that the daughter is being harassed, but the method of response might be inappropriate for her age. \n\nThe daycare teachers are supposed to monitor such interactions, even if they don't catch it every time. The parent has already reported the issue, but it didn't help. Maybe there's a need to escalate the problem to the daycare management or the other child's parents. Teaching a child to push back might lead to the other child's parents or daycare taking disciplinary actions against the parent's child, which could be unfair if the initial aggression was from the other child.\n\nAlso, the parent mentions that the child is \"very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids.\" So they're against violence in general but made an exception here. The line between defending oneself and using violence is thin, especially for a young child. The parent's approach might conflict with their usual teachings, causing confusion for the child.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent is trying to protect their daughter from unwanted physical contact, which is important. The daughter is already distressed, and the parent wants her to have tools to handle it. However, the solution might be more about teaching non-violent ways to set boundaries, like using words, walking away, or seeking help from adults more effectively. \n\nThe spouse's perspective is that involving teachers is better. Maybe the parent should work with the daycare to implement stricter supervision or address the other child's behavior through appropriate channels instead of teaching their daughter to push back. \n\nIn conclusion, while the parent's intention is to protect their child, the method of encouraging physical force might be inappropriate. The right approach could involve more collaboration with daycare staff and teaching the child non-violent assertiveness instead of physical retaliation. So the parent might be in the wrong for endorsing physical force in this situation.\n"
