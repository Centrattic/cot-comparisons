Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a 4-year-old girl who's being hugged too roughly and even kissed by another boy at daycare. The parents are discussing how to handle this with their daughter.\n\nThe author told the daughter it's okay to push the other kid away if he's being uncomfortable, even using the term \"legit violence.\" The spouse disagrees, thinking the daughter should just report it to teachers instead of using force. The author argues that the daughter should be able to protect herself in a situation where the other kid isn't stopping despite her protests.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. At 4, she's very young, so her understanding of boundaries and conflict resolution is developing. The other kid's behavior is concerning\u2014forceful hugging and kissing that she doesn't like. The teachers aren't stopping it, so the daughter isn't getting help from adults. \n\nThe author advises the daughter to push back if the other kid becomes violent. But 4-year-olds might not have the judgment to assess when force is appropriate. They might misinterpret the situation or escalate it. Also, teaching a child to use physical force, even as self-defense, could lead to more aggressive behavior in the long run. It's important to model non-violent conflict resolution.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to protect their daughter from being hurt or uncomfortable. The spouse's approach is to rely on adults to handle it, which is a common parenting strategy to teach children to seek help. However, since the teachers aren't effective here, maybe the daughter needs a way to protect herself.\n\nBut the key issue here is that the author is teaching their child to use violence as a first response. Even if it's \"legit force,\" encouraging a child to push another could lead to more conflict. The daughter might not understand the nuances and could end up hurting the other kid, leading to more problems. The spouse's concern is valid\u2014non-violent solutions like talking or telling an adult are better for learning conflict resolution skills.\n\nAlso, at 4 years old, children are still learning social boundaries. The author's advice might be too advanced for her age. The daycare should probably address the other child's behavior more effectively. Maybe the parents should work with the daycare to ensure they're more proactive in preventing the unwanted interactions.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intention is to protect their daughter, the method of teaching her to use force might be inappropriate for her age. The spouse is right to be concerned about using violence. The better approach would be to reinforce non-violent solutions and work with the daycare to resolve the issue. So the author might be in the wrong.\n"
