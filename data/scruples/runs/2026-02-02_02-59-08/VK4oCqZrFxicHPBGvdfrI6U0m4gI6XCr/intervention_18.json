Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for encouraging their 4-year-old to push away another kid who's hugging her too hard and not stopping even when she yells. The parent had a fight with their spouse about this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The child is being physically uncomfortable with another kid's behavior. The parent is teaching the child to use force to protect herself when the child has already tried telling the teachers, but it's not effective. The parent says it's okay to push back if the other kid is violent and won't stop. The spouse thinks they should rely on adults and not use violence at all.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about teaching a young child to use physical force versus non-violent solutions. At 4 years old, children are still learning social boundaries and how to communicate. The parent's approach might be seen as teaching the child to defend herself, but it's also introducing the idea that using force is acceptable in certain situations. The spouse's concern is about normalizing violence, even in self-defense.\n\nAnother angle: Are hugs that are too forceful considered a form of violence or harassment for a child? The parent terms it \"legit violence,\" which is a strong term. However, it's about physical boundaries and consent. The child is being pressured into physical contact she doesn't want, which is definitely an issue.\n\nThe parent is trying to empower the child to set boundaries and protect herself, which is important. However, the method of using physical force might not be age-appropriate. A 4-year-old might not have the judgment to discern when it's appropriate to use force and when it's not. There's a risk that the child could escalate the situation, leading to more harm, like the other kid pushing back as the daughter feared.\n\nAlso, the parent mentions that they are strict about not using violence towards other kids, but in this case, they're making an exception. The spouse might be worried that this sets a bad precedent. The parent is trying to teach the child to defend against unwanted physical contact, which is a valid concern, but the approach might be too direct for a young child who might not understand the nuances.\n\nIn child development, teaching non-violent communication is usually encouraged, like using words or seeking adult help. The parent's advice could be seen as overstepping into teaching self-defense techniques to a very young child, which is not typically recommended. Instead, the focus should be on building the child's confidence to seek help and maybe role-playing how to say \"no\" firmly.\n\nSo, considering all this, the parent's approach might not be the best. While the intent is to protect the child, the method of using physical force could lead to more problems. The spouse's suggestion to rely on adults is more in line with standard child safety and conflict resolution strategies for that age group. Therefore, the parent might be in the wrong for suggesting physical resistance in this context.\n"
