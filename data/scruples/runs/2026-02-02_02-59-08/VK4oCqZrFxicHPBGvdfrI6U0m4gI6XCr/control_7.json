Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The parent is dealing with a 4-year-old daughter who's being harassed by another kid at daycare. The other child is hugging and kissing her too forcefully, despite the daughter trying to stop him. The parent told the daughter it's okay to push him away if he's being violent, and even told her to push back or run away if the other kid retaliates. The spouse is upset, saying she should just tell the teachers instead of using violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the kids. Four-year-olds don't have the same understanding of boundaries as adults. They might not realize when their actions are too forceful. The parent is teaching the daughter to stand up for herself, which is important for self-defense. However, encouraging a child to push back might escalate the situation, especially since the other child might react violently. The daycare's role is to manage these interactions, so maybe the parent should rely more on the teachers to intervene.\n\nBut the daughter already told the teachers, and they haven't been effective. The parent is trying to empower the child to protect herself. However, teaching a child to use physical force at such a young age might not be developmentally appropriate. It could normalize violence as a solution, even if it's in self-defense. On the other hand, teaching her to set boundaries and assert herself is crucial for her safety.\n\nThe spouse's concern is valid because the daycare is responsible for managing such situations. The parent might be overstepping by instructing the child to use force, which could lead to more aggression. But the parent argues it's about self-defense in a clear case of being forced into unwanted contact. It's a balance between empowering the child and ensuring she doesn't learn that violence is acceptable.\n\nIn terms of child development, 4-year-olds are learning about personal space and how to express discomfort. The parent's approach might be too direct. Maybe there's a middle ground, like teaching the daughter to use words more firmly, or strategies to get an adult's attention quickly without physical confrontation. However, if the teachers aren't responding adequately, the parent might feel they have no choice but to teach self-defense.\n\nSo, the parent's intention is to protect their child, which is understandable. But the method might not be the best for a 4-year-old, as it could lead to more conflict. The spouse is right to be concerned about promoting violence. The parent might be in the wrong for not considering alternative methods that don't involve physical retaliation, especially in a daycare setting where staff should manage such interactions. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A, the parent is in the wrong, but there are valid points on both sides.\n"
