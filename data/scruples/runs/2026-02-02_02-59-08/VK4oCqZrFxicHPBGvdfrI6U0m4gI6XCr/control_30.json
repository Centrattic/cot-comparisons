Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The parent is asking if they're in the wrong for advising their 4-year-old to push away another kid who's hugging her too forcefully and even kissing her, despite the daughter's protests. The parent's main point is about teaching self-defense when someone won't stop after being told. The spouse argues against using any violence, preferring to report to teachers.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the child's age. Four years old might not grasp the concept of non-violent solutions well. If the other kid keeps forcing hugs despite being told to stop, the daughter might feel scared or trapped. The parent is teaching a form of self-defense, which makes sense in situations where there's immediate harm. However, teaching a child to push back could escalate the situation. The key here is whether the parent's response is appropriate for a 4-year-old's capacity to understand and handle the situation.\n\nAlso, the daycare teachers are supposed to handle such issues. The parent might be overstepping by not relying solely on the daycare's intervention. But the teachers aren't effective here since the behavior persists. There's a balance between empowering the child to protect herself and ensuring she doesn't resort to violence unnecessarily. \n\nThe parent's advice isn't about aggressive retaliation but about setting boundaries. However, the spouse is right that promoting non-violence is important. At 4, kids might not discern when force is appropriate. The parent's solution might be too advanced for her age. Maybe alternative strategies like role-playing with a teacher or teaching her to walk away could be better. \n\nIn conclusion, while the parent's intention is to protect their child, the method might not be age-appropriate. So, the answer might lean towards AITA being in the parent's favor, but there's a valid argument that the parent is in the wrong for encouraging violence, even if justified. However, considering the child's safety, it's a tough call. Maybe the parent isn't entirely wrong, but there's room for improvement in their approach.\n"
