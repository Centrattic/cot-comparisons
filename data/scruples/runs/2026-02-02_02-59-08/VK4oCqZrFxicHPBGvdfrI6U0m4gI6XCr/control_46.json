Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the parent who encouraged their 4-year-old to push away another kid who's hugging her too roughly is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The child in daycare is being hugged forcefully by another kid, sometimes kissed, and the daughter is uncomfortable. The parent advised her to push away if the other kid is hurting her and not stopping. The spouse disagrees, saying it's better to tell the teacher and avoid violence.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the child is being physically uncomfortable, the parent is teaching self-defense, but the spouse thinks violence should be avoided even at that age.\n\nI should consider child development. A 4-year-old is old enough to understand personal space and boundaries, right? But teaching them to push back might set a precedent for using physical force. However, the parent is emphasizing only in cases of \"legit violence,\" so it's not about aggression but self-preservation.\n\nOn one hand, the parent wants to empower the child to protect herself when adults aren't around. On the other, the spouse is concerned about promoting violence. There's also the daycare's responsibility to handle the situation. The teachers aren't responding effectively, so the parent is trying to fill that gap.\n\nBut is teaching a 4-year-old to use physical force appropriate? Maybe there are other non-violent responses, like using words, moving away, or seeking help. Pushing could escalate the situation. However, if the other kid is aggressive and the child is in distress, the parent's advice might be necessary for immediate safety.\n\nI need to check if the advice was excessive. The parent isn't teaching the child to attack but to defend herself from unwanted and forceful contact. The line between self-defense and violence can be thin here. Since the other child isn't respecting the daughter's boundaries despite verbal cues, physical response might be the last resort.\n\nBut the question is whether the parent is in the wrong. It's a parenting decision. Some might say it's right to teach self-advocacy, others might argue it's too young for that. The spouse's point about telling an adult is valid, but the parent is also considering the child's immediate safety when adults aren't present.\n\nHmm. The parent's approach might be justified because they are addressing a specific, ongoing issue where other methods haven't worked. However, the spouse's concern about using violence is valid too. It's a balance between self-protection and non-violence. The answer might depend on cultural or personal parenting philosophies.\n\nIn the end, the parent isn't teaching the child to be violent for no reason, but to defend against it. The situation is about personal space and safety. So maybe the parent isn't in the wrong, but it's a close call. The answer might be B, No.\n"
