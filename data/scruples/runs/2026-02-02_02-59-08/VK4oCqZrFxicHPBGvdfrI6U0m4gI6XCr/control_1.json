Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the parent is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe parent's four-year-old daughter is being hugged and kissed forcefully by another child at daycare. The other kid doesn't stop even when she yells. The teachers haven't been able to address it effectively. The parent told their daughter it's okay to push the other kid away if it's making her uncomfortable and even to push back or run away if the other kid retaliates. The spouse disagrees, thinking she should just tell the teachers and not use violence.\n\nFirst, I should consider the age of the child. Four years old is very young, and their ability to handle conflict or understand boundaries is still developing. The parent's intention is to protect their daughter from uncomfortable or potentially harmful situations. However, teaching a child to use physical force, even defensive, might set a precedent for using violence as a solution. On the other hand, the other child's behavior could be seen as a form of bullying or not respecting personal space, which is a serious issue.\n\nThe daycare's role is also important here. The parent mentioned that the teachers haven't been effective. Maybe there's a need to escalate the issue with the daycare or involve other authorities, like the parents of the other child. But the parent felt that the existing measures weren't working, so they took it upon themselves to advise their daughter on self-defense.\n\nThere's a balance between teaching a child to stand up for themselves and avoiding the use of violence. The parent's approach might be considered appropriate in terms of teaching self-defense, especially since the other child isn't respecting boundaries. However, some might argue that it's better for a child that age to learn non-violent conflict resolution first, relying on adults to handle the situation.\n\nThe spouse's concern is valid because encouraging a child to use physical force could lead to a cycle of violence. The parent does clarify that they're not encouraging general violence, but specifically in cases of \"legit violence.\" However, at four years old, a child might not fully understand the nuances of when it's appropriate to push back.\n\nAnother angle is the legal and ethical perspective. Some places have guidelines about children defending themselves, but typically, parents are advised to teach children to seek help first. The parent's advice might be seen as overstepping if it leads the child to use violence without proper guidance.\n\nIn conclusion, the parent's intention is good, but the method might not be the best approach for a four-year-old. Teaching a child to use physical force could have unintended consequences, such as escalating the conflict or teaching the wrong lesson about resolving disputes. The spouse's advice to rely on teachers and adults is more aligned with standard child-rearing practices for that age. Therefore, the parent might be in the wrong for encouraging physical retaliation instead of focusing on communication and seeking adult help.\n"
