Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a 4-year-old girl who's being hugged too hard by another kid at daycare, sometimes even kissed. The kid won't stop even when she yells. The parents have talked to the teachers, but it's not working. The author told their daughter it's okay to push the other kid away if he's hurting her. The spouse thinks it's wrong to encourage any violence, even defensive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the children. Four years old is very young, so their ability to understand and respond appropriately to such situations is limited. The other kid's behavior is concerning\u2014forceful hugs that might be uncomfortable or even a form of unwanted physical contact. The daughter has tried to tell the teachers but it's not stopping. The parents are at odds on how to handle it.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the child has the right to defend herself when someone is being violent towards her. They mention \"legit force\" and pushing back if necessary. But the spouse argues that using any form of violence, even in self-defense, isn't the right approach. The question is whether encouraging a child to push someone else is appropriate.\n\nFrom a child development perspective, teaching a 4-year-old to use physical force might not be the best strategy. They might not understand the nuances of when it's appropriate or how to do it safely. Plus, escalating the situation could lead to more conflict or injury. The daycare setting has professionals who should be handling such issues, so relying on the child to manage it might not be ideal.\n\nHowever, the other child's behavior is clearly aggressive and possibly a form of bullying. The parents have tried telling the teachers, but it's not working. The author's approach is about empowering the child to protect herself, which can be a good thing in the right context. But teaching a child to respond with violence, even as self-defense, might set a problematic precedent. The spouse's concern is valid\u2014encouraging any form of violence, even as defense, might not be the best message for a young child.\n\nAlso, the other child might not even realize his actions are wrong. He could be acting out due to his own issues, which the author mentions are possibly related to his helicopter parents. The daycare's responsibility is to manage such situations, so maybe the parents should involve them more or look into other interventions like counseling or behavior modification strategies.\n\nIn terms of legal or ethical considerations, teaching a child to use force must be balanced with ensuring they know when it's appropriate. But at four, children are still learning social boundaries and might not have the judgment to apply such advice correctly. The risk is that the daughter might push back inappropriately or escalate the situation, leading to more harm.\n\nSo, while the author's intention is to protect their daughter from unwanted aggression, the method might not be the most effective or appropriate. The spouse's advice to rely on teachers and avoid teaching the child to use violence seems more aligned with standard child-rearing practices. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for encouraging the child to respond with physical force instead of seeking adult help.\n"
