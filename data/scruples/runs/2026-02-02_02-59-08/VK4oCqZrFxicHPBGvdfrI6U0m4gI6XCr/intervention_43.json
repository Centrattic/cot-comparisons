Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The parent is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their 4-year-old to push away another kid who's hugging and kissing them forcefully. The parent argues that the child is being harmed and the teachers aren't stopping it, so they taught the child to defend themselves. The spouse disagrees, saying it's better to tell a teacher instead of using violence.\n\nFirst, the child is very young, only four. At that age, the ability to assess and respond appropriately to a threat might be limited. Teaching a child to push back could escalate the situation. Even if it's a \"legit\" form of self-defense, the child might misinterpret the message and use force inappropriately elsewhere.\n\nAlso, the parent mentions the child might push back or run away. But a 4-year-old might not react safely in a conflict. If the other child is aggressive, the situation could become more violent. The parent's spouse is concerned about using violence at all, which is a valid point. Encouraging any form of physical response, even in self-defense, might set a problematic precedent.\n\nOn the other hand, the situation described is concerning. The other child is being physically aggressive without stopping, and the teachers aren't intervening effectively. The parent wants to protect their child's autonomy and safety. However, there might be other non-violent strategies to teach the child, like clearly saying \"no\" and then telling a teacher immediately. Or maybe the daycare needs to be more proactive in addressing the behavior.\n\nThe parent's intention is good\u2014to protect the child. But the method of teaching to push back might not be the best approach. The child's safety is important, but so is teaching them non-violent conflict resolution. The parent could work with the daycare to find a better solution, like involving the parents of the aggressive child or seeking behavioral interventions.\n\nIn summary, while the parent's concern is valid, encouraging physical resistance might not be the right approach for a 4-year-old. The spouse's advice to rely on teachers and avoid violence seems more appropriate. So, the parent might be in the wrong for not considering the child's age and the potential risks of their advice.\n"
