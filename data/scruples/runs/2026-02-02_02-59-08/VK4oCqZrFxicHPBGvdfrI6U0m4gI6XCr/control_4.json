Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's see. The situation is about a 4-year-old girl being hugged and kissed too forcefully by another kid at daycare, and the parent advised her to push back if it's uncomfortable. The spouse thinks that teaching the child to use violence is wrong, but the parent argues it's about self-defense.\n\nFirst, I should consider the age of the child. At 4 years old, kids are still learning social boundaries. The other child is being overbearing, not respecting the daughter's personal space. The parent's advice is to push away, which is a physical response, but the parent is teaching her to use force only when necessary, not just for fun. The husband thinks they should rely on adults instead. \n\nThe daycare teachers haven't been effective because they don't see the incidents happening. That's a problem because the child can't get help from authority figures there. The parent's advice is a way to empower the daughter to protect herself. However, using physical force even in self-defense might escalate the situation. But the parent is not encouraging violence; they're teaching the child to defend herself when others won't stop. \n\nAlso, the daughter is aware of the situation and can communicate. The parent is teaching her to assess the threat level and respond appropriately. The alternative is that the daughter might be hurt or uncomfortable if she doesn't act. On the other hand, the parent could be instilling fear or encouraging aggression. But given the context, the parent's intention is to protect the child. \n\nI think the key here is distinguishing between teaching self-defense (using just enough force to stop an immediate threat) versus encouraging violence. Since the parent is explaining that it's okay to push away when the other child is being violent and not listening to her, it seems like a reasonable approach. The spouse might be worried about the child becoming aggressive, but the parent is emphasizing legitimate force. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the parent is trying to protect their daughter in a situation where adults aren't intervening properly. The answer is probably B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
