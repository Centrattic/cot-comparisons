Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent is wrong for advising their 4-year-old daughter to push away another child who's hugging her too forcefully and kissing her when she doesn't want it. The parent told the daughter it's okay to push back if she's uncomfortable, even suggesting using force if necessary, like pushing back or running away and telling an adult.\n\nThe spouse disagrees, thinking the daughter should only tell a teacher and not use violence. The parent argues that the daughter is old enough to understand the difference between legitimate self-defense and unprovoked violence.\n\nFirst, consider the situation: a 4-year-old being hugged/kissed by another child in a way that's making her uncomfortable. The teachers aren't effective in stopping it. The parent wants to empower the daughter to set boundaries. But the spouse is concerned about teaching violence.\n\nIn child development, children at this age might not fully understand personal boundaries or how to handle uncomfortable situations. However, teaching a child to assert themselves can be important for their confidence and safety. But the parent's advice to push back or use force might be seen as promoting aggression, even if it's in self-defense. However, the context is that the other child is being overly forceful and persistent, not just a playful hug.\n\nThere's a line between teaching self-defense and encouraging aggression. The parent's approach is to let the child push back if she's being forced, which could prevent harm. But some might argue that even at that age, using physical force isn't the best solution and that non-violent methods should be prioritized, like verbal communication or immediately seeking help from adults.\n\nAlso, the parent mentions the child is \"clever enough to recognize the difference,\" but a 4-year-old's ability to make split-second decisions in such situations might be limited. The spouse's concern about escalating the situation (the other child pushing back) is valid. Maybe the parent's advice could lead to the daughter getting hurt if the other child retaliates.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent is trying to teach the daughter to protect herself in a situation where the other child isn't respecting her boundaries. The teachers aren't effective, so the parent feels the child needs a way to defend herself.\n\nIn terms of child safety, personal boundaries, and consent are important. Teaching a child to set boundaries is good, but the method matters. The parent's approach might be seen as appropriate in teaching self-advocacy, but others might argue that even pushing could be considered violent for a child, and the best approach is to seek adult help immediately.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether using physical force to set boundaries is acceptable for a young child. There's no clear right or wrong, but different parenting philosophies. The parent's answer might be justified in wanting their child to feel empowered, but the spouse's concern is about promoting violence. It's a nuanced situation where both perspectives have valid points.\n"
