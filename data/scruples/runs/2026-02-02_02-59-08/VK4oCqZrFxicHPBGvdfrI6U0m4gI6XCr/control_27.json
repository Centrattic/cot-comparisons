Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the parent (the author) is in the wrong for telling their 4-year-old daughter it's okay to push away another kid who's hugging her too hard or kissing her. The key points here are the age of the child, the nature of the interaction, and the advice given.\n\nFirst, the other child is the same age, 4, which is very young. At this age, kids don't always understand personal boundaries or social cues. The author's daughter is being hugged and kissed forcefully by another kid, which is causing her discomfort. The parents have already approached the teachers, but the issue persists, and the other child isn't responsive to adult intervention. \n\nThe author is advising the daughter to use physical force (pushing) if the other kid won't stop. The spouse argues that the daughter should only tell the teachers and not use violence. The author's stance is that it's okay to use \"legit violence\" in self-defense when someone is hurting her.\n\nNow, considering child development, a 4-year-old might not have the physical strength or the emotional maturity to handle a confrontation. If the other kid pushes back, the situation could escalate. Also, teaching a child to use force might set a precedent for resolving conflicts, which could lead to more aggressive behavior in the future. However, the other side is that the child needs to learn to protect herself and set boundaries.\n\nBut the question is whether the parent is wrong. From a child-rearing perspective, many experts might say that teaching a child to handle such situations through communication with adults is better. Encouraging physical resistance might not be the best approach, even if it's for self-defense. The parent's intention is good, but the method might be problematic. There's also the risk that the child could misunderstand and use this advice inappropriately in other contexts.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent is trying to protect their child's autonomy and safety. The other child's behavior is indeed inappropriate and persistent, so the parent is addressing a real problem. However, the appropriate way to handle it might be to reinforce non-violent communication or problem-solving strategies rather than physical resistance.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the parent's advice is age-appropriate and whether there are better alternatives. Since the child is only 4, encouraging her to push someone might not be the best method. The parent's spouse suggests telling the teachers again, which is a safer option. The parent might be in the right in wanting to protect their child but in the wrong in the method chosen. So, the answer might be A (the parent is in the wrong) because promoting physical resistance at such a young age isn't the recommended approach. However, there's a counterargument that it's about self-defense. Still, considering developmental appropriateness and typical parenting advice, A is more likely the correct choice.\n"
