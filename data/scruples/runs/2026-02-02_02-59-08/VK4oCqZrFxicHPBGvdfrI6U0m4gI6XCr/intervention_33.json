Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for telling their 4-year-old to push away another child who's hugging and kissing her too roughly. \n\nFirst, the situation: the other kid is being overly forceful, not stopping even when told. The parents have already reported it, but the teachers aren't catching it in the act. The parent advises their daughter to push back if the kid won't stop, and to defend herself if the other child reacts. \n\nThe partner is upset, saying it's better to tell the teachers instead of using violence. The parent argues that it's about \"legit force\" in a situation where the child is being hurt.\n\nSo, the main points to consider are: Is it appropriate to teach a 4-year-old to use physical force to defend herself in this context? Do the parents have a responsibility to prioritize non-violent solutions first? \n\nOn one hand, the parent wants their child to protect herself when adults aren't helping. It's understandable to want to empower the child to set boundaries. But on the other hand, promoting physical defense at such a young age might encourage aggression or escalate conflicts. Also, the child is very young\u2014might not fully understand how to apply the advice appropriately or could misinterpret the situation. \n\nThe partner's concern is valid because teaching kids to resort to violence, even in self-defense, can set a problematic precedent. There's also the risk that the child might push without realizing the force needed, leading to actual harm. Plus, daycare settings usually have protocols for managing such interactions, and relying on adults to intervene is a standard approach.\n\nHowever, the parent's intention is to protect their daughter from discomfort and potential harm, which is a good motive. The key is whether the method is appropriate. The line between self-defense and encouraging violence is thin here. The parent emphasizes using \"legit force,\" but at 4, it's hard to teach that nuance effectively. The child might just push forcefully regardless of the context.\n\nConsidering all this, the parent might be in the wrong because they're encouraging physical confrontation at a very young age where non-violent solutions are typically the norm. Even though the intention is protective, the method could lead to more issues. So, the answer is A.\n"
