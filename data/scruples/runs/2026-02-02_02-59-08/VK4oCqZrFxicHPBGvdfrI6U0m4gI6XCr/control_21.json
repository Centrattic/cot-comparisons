Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the parent (the author) is in the wrong for encouraging their 4-year-old daughter to push away another kid who's hugging her too hard and even kissing her without consent. The parent's partner thinks it's wrong to use violence at all, while the parent argues that it's legitimate force in a situation of violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The other child is being physically overbearing, and the daughter has already tried to tell the teachers, but it's not stopping. The parent is advising the daughter to use force if the other child is being violent. At 4 years old, the child is very young, so the parent's approach might be about teaching self-defense. But there's a concern here about teaching a child to use violence, even in self-defense. \n\nOn one hand, the parent is trying to protect their child from unwanted physical contact, which is important. Teaching a child to stand up for themselves in a way that's necessary to stop harm could be justified. However, the partner argues that it's better to rely on adults and not use violence. The parent also mentions that they are generally against violence toward other kids. \n\nBut there's a line between self-defense and encouraging aggression. At 4, a child might not fully understand the difference between a firm \"no\" and aggressive pushing. Also, if the other child reacts by pushing back, the situation could escalate. The parent's advice includes running away and telling an adult, which is good, but the initial advice to push might set a precedent for using physical force.\n\nAnother angle is that the daycare teachers are supposed to monitor and manage such interactions. The parent might have a point that the teachers aren't effective, but maybe there's another way to address it, like changing the child's class or discussing with the other parents. \n\nIn terms of child development, teaching a 4-year-old to use physical force might not be the best approach. They might not have the emotional maturity to assess when force is appropriate. It could lead to more aggressive behavior in other contexts. However, the parent is trying to protect their child from unwanted and possibly harmful contact, which is a valid concern.\n\nSo, balancing these factors, the parent might be in the wrong because they're teaching a young child to use violence, which could have unintended consequences. The partner's concern about non-violence and relying on adults seems valid, especially given the child's age. Even if the situation is uncomfortable, the appropriate response for a 4-year-old might be learning to say \"no\" more firmly and seeking help from adults, not using physical force. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
