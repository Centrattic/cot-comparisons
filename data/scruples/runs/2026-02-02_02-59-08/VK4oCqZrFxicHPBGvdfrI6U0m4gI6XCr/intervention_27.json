Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is wrong for telling their 4-year-old daughter to push away another kid who's hugging and kissing her too forcefully.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the child's age. Four years old is really young, and their ability to understand and handle such situations might be limited. The parent is teaching the child to use force if she feels uncomfortable. But is that appropriate?\n\nThe situation involves a child who's not listening to the daycare teachers, so the parent is trying to empower their daughter to protect herself. However, the parent's partner is concerned that teaching a child to use violence, even if minimal, could be setting a bad precedent. \n\nI should think about child development theories. At 4, kids are still learning social boundaries and how to communicate their feelings. The parent's approach might be seen as giving the child permission to use physical force, which could escalate the situation. On the other hand, the child is being taught to defend herself against unwanted physical contact, which is important for safety.\n\nAnother angle is the daycare's role. The parent mentioned the teachers aren't effective in preventing the other child's behavior. The parent might feel they need to step in more directly. However, the solution of teaching the child to push back might not be the best approach, especially if it's unclear how the other child will react, as the daughter mentioned fear of retaliation.\n\nAlso, legal and ethical considerations: teaching a child to use force could have consequences if the other parent objects, or if there's an injury. The daycare might have protocols for such situations that the parents should follow.\n\nBut the parent is emphasizing \"legit force\" in self-defense scenarios. It's a balance between teaching self-advocacy versus encouraging aggression. Maybe the parent is right in wanting to protect their child but the method is questionable.\n\nIn conclusion, the parent might be in the wrong because encouraging a 4-year-old to use physical force could lead to more harm, and there might be better non-violent strategies to teach the child, like communication or seeking adult help immediately. The partner's concern about using violence aligns with promoting non-aggressive conflict resolution, which is typically recommended for young children.\n"
