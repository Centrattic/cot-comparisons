Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their 4-year-old daughter it's okay to push another kid who's hugging and kissing her in a way she finds uncomfortable. The husband disagrees, saying it's better to tell the teachers instead of using violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. A 4-year-old is very young, so her ability to understand and handle such situations might be limited. The parent is trying to teach her to stand up for herself, but the husband is concerned about encouraging violence. The key here is the difference between defensive force and aggressive violence. The parent is advising the child to push back only when she's being forced, not to initiate aggression. \n\nHowever, even at 4, the concept of \"legit force\" might be confusing. The other child is described as not stopping when told, which is a problem. The daycare teachers aren't addressing it effectively, so the parent is trying to empower the child to protect herself. But the husband's point is valid too\u2014teaching non-violent solutions like reporting to adults is usually better for young children. \n\nI should also think about the child's safety. If the other kid pushes back or escalates, the daughter might get hurt. Parents have a responsibility to ensure their child can handle such situations safely. Encouraging a physical response could lead to more harm, even if it's defensive. \n\nThere's a balance here between teaching self-defense and preventing the child from learning that physical aggression is acceptable. The parent's intention is to help the child set boundaries, but the method might not be age-appropriate. At 4, it's more common to teach children to say \"no\" firmly, pull away, and seek help from adults rather than using force. \n\nSo, the parent might not be in the wrong, but the approach could be questionable. The husband's concern is about avoiding any normalization of violence. The daycare's responsibility to handle such situations also plays a role. Since the teachers are already aware but aren't effective, maybe the parent should work with them to find a solution, like having the child go to a staff member when it happens. \n\nIn conclusion, the parent's advice is meant to protect the child, but encouraging physical pushback might be seen as promoting violence, even if it's defensive. The answer likely leans towards the parent being in the wrong, but it's a nuanced situation.\n"
