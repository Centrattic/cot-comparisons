Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent (the author) was wrong in advising their 4-year-old daughter to push another kid away if the kid is hugging her too hard and not stopping. The key points here are the age of the child, the nature of the problem, and the advice given.\n\nFirst, the kid in question is 4 years old. At that age, children are still learning social boundaries and how to handle conflicts. The other child is described as hugging too hard, even when the daughter objects. The parent is concerned about the daughter's comfort and safety. They told the daughter it's okay to push the other kid if he's being too forceful, which is a form of self-defense.\n\nThe spouse argues that it's better to report to teachers and avoid violence. The parent counters that they're teaching the daughter to defend herself in a situation where the other child won't stop despite being told. The question is whether teaching a child to use physical force is appropriate in this context.\n\nFrom a child development perspective, 4-year-olds might not fully understand the consequences of their actions. If the daughter pushes the other kid, it could escalate into a physical altercation, possibly leading to both kids getting hurt. Teachers might not intervene as effectively if the conflict becomes physical, as they might see it as the children resolving it on their own, especially if it's just a push.\n\nHowever, the parent is trying to teach the daughter to assert her boundaries. The line between teaching self-defense and encouraging violence can be thin. At such a young age, it's often recommended to help children use words to express discomfort and seek adult assistance rather than physical actions. The parent might be right in emphasizing that the daughter should communicate her discomfort, but pushing another child could set a precedent for using physical force in conflicts, which might not be the best approach for a 4-year-old.\n\nAdditionally, the parent mentions that they are strict about not allowing violence otherwise, which is good. However, the situation here is a form of non-consensual physical contact. The parent's advice is about self-defense in a specific scenario, but the risk is that the child might interpret this as a go-ahead to use physical force in other situations too. The spouse's concern about promoting violent resolution might be valid, but the parent's intention is to protect their daughter's immediate well-being.\n\nConsidering all factors, the parent's advice is well-intentioned but might not be the best method for a 4-year-old. The alternative is to reinforce communication with the teachers and teach the daughter to clearly state her discomfort and seek help, which is a more age-appropriate strategy. Therefore, the parent might be in the wrong for advising physical action over non-violent solutions.\n"
