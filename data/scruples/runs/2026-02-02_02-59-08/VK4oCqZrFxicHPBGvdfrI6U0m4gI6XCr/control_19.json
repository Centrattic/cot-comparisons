Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for telling their 4-year-old to push away another kid who's hugging/kissing her violently. The parent's spouse disagrees, saying it's better to tell a teacher instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The child is being hugged forcefully and even kissed without consent. The daughter has already told the teachers, but it's not stopping. The parent is advising her to use force to protect herself if the other kid won't stop. The parent is emphasizing that it's okay to push back in self-defense.\n\nThe spouse argues against teaching the child to use violence. But the parent is not advocating for general violence; it's a specific case where the child is being physically forced. The child is young, so the parent wants to teach her to protect herself when adults aren't around.\n\nIn terms of parenting approaches, some believe in non-violence and always going to an adult, while others think teaching self-defense is important. The key here is that the parent isn't encouraging random aggression but a response to being harmed. The daughter is aware of the difference because they're clear on violence in general. Also, the parent added to run away or tell an adult if needed.\n\nLegally and ethically, self-defense is justified when someone is being harmed. Even for children, teaching them to defend themselves can be seen as protective. However, there's a risk that the child might overreact or use excessive force, but the parent is advising proportionate actions like pushing. The daycare's role is crucial, but since the teachers aren't effective, the parent is stepping in.\n\nAnother angle is the child's emotional state. The daughter is conflicted about the other kid pushing back. The parent's advice includes options beyond just pushing, like running and telling. It's about safety. The spouse's concern is valid, but in cases of potential abuse or harassment, allowing the child to set boundaries is important.\n\nSo, considering the context, the parent is trying to protect their daughter from unwanted physical contact that's not stopping. The parent's advice is specific to self-defense, not aggression. Therefore, the parent isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
