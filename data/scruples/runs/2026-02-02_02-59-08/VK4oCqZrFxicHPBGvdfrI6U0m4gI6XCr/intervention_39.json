Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The parent is encouraging their 4-year-old daughter to push away another kid who's hugging or kissing her too forcefully. The child has already told the teachers, but the behavior continues. The parent argues that it's legitimate for the daughter to use force when someone is hurting her despite her protests. The spouse thinks the daughter should just tell the teachers and avoid violence. The question is whether the parent is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. At 4, she's very young and might not have the judgment to assess when force is appropriate. Teaching a child to use physical force, even in self-defense, could lead to unintended consequences. Kids her age don't always understand social cues correctly, and pushing someone could escalate the situation. There's also the matter of teaching non-violent conflict resolution. Schools usually have policies against physical retaliation, even if it's to stop another child. The parent might be overstepping by encouraging violence, even in a specific context. However, the parent's concern about their child being uncomfortable is valid. The alternative solutions, like reporting to teachers, might not be working, so the parent is trying to empower their daughter.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent's advice might lead to the daughter being labeled as aggressive or getting into trouble. Also, there's a risk of the daughter misusing the advice. The spouse's point about relying on teachers is valid, but the teachers haven't been effective. The parent is trying to give their child agency, but maybe the approach is too aggressive for a 4-year-old. It's a balance between self-defense and teaching non-violence. Considering all factors, maybe the parent is in the wrong because they're introducing violence as a solution too early, even if the intent is good. So, answer A.\n"
