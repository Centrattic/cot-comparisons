Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The parent is telling their 4-year-old daughter it's okay to push away a kid who's hugging her too hard and kissing her without consent. The daughter already tried telling the teachers, but it's not stopping. The parent argues that the daughter can use \"legit force\" to protect herself, while the spouse thinks she should rely on adults instead.\n\nFirst, the child's safety and comfort are important. The other kid's actions seem inappropriate and possibly abusive. The daughter is being physically forced into contact she doesn't want. At 4, she might not understand how to handle this without immediate tactics, especially if the teachers aren't effective.\n\nBut the parent is teaching her to push back, which could escalate things. However, the parent isn't encouraging violence; they're teaching self-defense. The key here is that the other child is using force and violating her space, so the parent's advice is about protecting her in a moment when adults aren't around. The spouse's approach is more about non-violence, which is good in general, but maybe not practical in this scenario if the problem persists.\n\nAlso, the parent is emphasizing that the daughter should use force only when necessary and then run to an adult. That seems reasonable. Kids that age might not always tell an adult in the moment, so giving her tools to protect herself could be necessary until the adults can intervene properly. The parent isn't advocating for general violence but specific self-defense in a harmful situation.\n\nBut there's a line between self-defense and encouraging aggression. However, given the context, the parent's actions seem justified to protect their child's well-being. So maybe the answer is B, the parent isn't in the wrong.\n"
