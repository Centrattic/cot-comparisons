Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for advising their 4-year-old daughter to push away another kid who's hugging her too forcefully and not respecting her boundaries.\n\nFirst, the situation involves a young child being subjected to unwanted, forceful hugs and kisses by another child. The daughter has already reported this to the teachers, but it's not stopping. The author told their daughter it's okay to push back if the other kid won't stop, even suggesting pushing back or running to an adult if the other child reacts aggressively.\n\nNow, considering the age of the children, 4 years old, their capacity to handle such situations might be limited. The author's intention is to teach self-defense and assertiveness, which is understandable. However, encouraging physical resistance, even in self-defense, might not be appropriate for a preschooler. At that age, kids don't always understand the consequences of their actions, and using force could escalate the situation. The spouse is concerned that the daughter might retaliate in a way that causes more harm or that the daughter might become desensitized to using violence.\n\nThe teachers are supposed to handle such behavioral issues in daycare. The fact that the teachers aren't noticing the behavior suggests there's a problem with supervision or communication. The parent's advice might be filling a gap where the daycare isn't addressing the issue properly. But from a child's perspective, the parent is teaching them to defend themselves physically, which could be seen as promoting aggression, even if it's in self-defense.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent is trying to protect their child from ongoing unwanted physical contact. The line between teaching self-defense and encouraging violence can be thin. The key here is whether the parent's advice is proportionate. Pushing away might be a reasonable immediate response to stop unwanted contact, but suggesting to push back again if the other child retaliates could lead to a cycle of aggression.\n\nAlso, the daycare's role is to manage such situations. The fact that the daughter has already told the teachers and it's not resolved is a problem on the daycare's part. The parent's solution is a response to that failure. But as a parent, guiding the child to assert their boundaries through actions like pushing might not be the best approach, especially in a structured environment where adults are supposed to intervene.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the parent might be in the wrong because they're teaching a physical response rather than relying on the daycare's responsibility. However, the root issue is that the daycare isn't handling the situation properly. The parent is trying to protect their child, but the method might not be the most appropriate for a preschooler. The correct approach might involve more advocacy with the daycare, not just for the immediate issue but to ensure the child's safety and teach non-violent ways to handle conflicts.\n"
