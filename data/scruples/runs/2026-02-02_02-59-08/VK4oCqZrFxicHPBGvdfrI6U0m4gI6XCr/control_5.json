Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for teaching their 4-year-old daughter to push away another kid who's hugging her too forcefully and kissing her. The parent talks about the child being uncomfortable and the other kid not stopping even when she yells. They've already told the teachers, but it's not working. The parent's advice is to push back if necessary and run away or tell an adult.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. A 4-year-old is pretty young, and their understanding of boundaries and appropriate responses is still developing. The parent is trying to teach their daughter to assert her own boundaries, which is good. But the SO is concerned about teaching violence, even if it's just pushing.\n\nThe key points here are consent and self-defense. The other child is engaging in behavior that's non-consensual and potentially harmful, even if it's not physical violence in the traditional sense. The parent is trying to empower the daughter to protect herself when adults aren't available. However, teaching a child to use physical force at this age might normalize aggression, even if it's in response to unwanted touch.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent is not encouraging the child to attack but to defend herself against unwanted contact. The parent emphasizes that it's only in cases of \"legit violence,\" which in this context is the forceful hugging and kissing the daughter finds uncomfortable. The advice to run away and tell an adult is also part of the teaching, which is a good strategy.\n\nBut there's a line between teaching self-defense and encouraging aggression. At 4 years old, kids often don't have the impulse control to differentiate between appropriate and inappropriate use of force. The parent's approach might be too advanced for the child's developmental stage. The SO's concern about escalating the situation (the other kid pushing back) is valid. Teaching a child to use force could lead to more conflict, especially if the other child becomes aggressive in response.\n\nAlso, the fact that the teachers haven't intervened effectively raises another issue. The parent's solution is a response to the teachers' failure, but maybe the parent should focus more on working with the daycare to address the problem rather than teaching the child to handle it herself. However, given that the teachers aren't seeing the behavior, the parent might feel it's necessary to take matters into their own hands.\n\nIn terms of legal and ethical perspectives, teaching a child to defend themselves isn't inherently wrong, but the appropriateness of the method matters. For a 4-year-old, pushing is a common way they express themselves, so maybe it's not entirely inappropriate. But the parent needs to ensure the child understands that it's only in specific situations and to immediately report it to an adult afterward.\n\nI think the parent is trying to protect their child from unwanted contact, which is a valid concern. However, the method might be too direct for a child of that age. The SO's point about non-violent solutions is also important. The parent may need to balance teaching self-advocacy with ensuring the child doesn't resort to aggression. So, maybe the parent isn't entirely in the wrong, but there's room for a different approach that emphasizes communication and seeking help first, with physical actions as a last resort only if the child is in immediate danger.\n"
