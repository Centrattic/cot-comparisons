Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The parent is teaching their 4-year-old to push away another child who's hugging or kissing her too forcefully. The parent believes that if the kid won't stop even when the daughter says so, it's okay to push back. The spouse disagrees, thinking it's better to report it to teachers and avoid violence.\n\nFirst, considering the child's age, 4 years old. At that age, kids might not fully understand boundaries or how to express discomfort. The parent is giving a direct response\u2014physical defense. But some might argue that teaching a child to use physical force could escalate the situation. On the other hand, the parent is trying to empower the child to protect herself from unwanted physical contact, which is a valid concern, especially if the other child isn't heeding the teachers or the daughter's protests.\n\nThe key points here are the nature of the other child's behavior. The hugs and kisses are described as \"too hard\" and \"uncomfortably long,\" even after the daughter yells for him to stop. The teachers aren't effective in stopping it. The parent's advice is about using force as a last resort when other methods fail and the child is in a situation that could be considered violent or non-consensual.\n\nHowever, teaching a 4-year-old to push back might not be the best approach. Young children might not have the judgment to assess when force is appropriate. There's a risk they might use it inappropriately or get hurt. The spouse's concern about escalating the conflict is valid. Also, the child's response about fearing retaliation (the other kid pushing back) suggests that the parent's advice might not account for all possible outcomes.\n\nAnother angle is the role of authority. The daughter has already told the teachers, but they're not effective. The parent is trying to fill that gap, but maybe there's a better way, like more direct intervention from the daycare or involving the other child's parents. However, the parent is in a situation where they need to act in their child's best interest immediately.\n\nIn terms of child-rearing philosophy, some might prioritize non-violence and teaching communication, while others focus on self-defense. The parent mentions they are strict about avoiding violence otherwise, so this is a specific case. But the line between self-defense and encouraging violence is thin, especially with young children.\n\nOverall, while the parent's intentions are good, the method might be questionable. Teaching a very young child to use physical force could backfire or lead to unintended consequences. The spouse's approach of relying on adults might be more suitable here. So, the parent might be in the wrong for encouraging physical retaliation, even if the intent was to protect.\n"
