Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the parent is in the wrong here. The situation is about a 4-year-old girl being hugged and kissed forcefully by another kid at daycare. The parent advised the child to push away if she's uncomfortable, and even to push back if the other kid reacts. The spouse disagrees, saying it's better to tell the teachers instead of using violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what's appropriate for a 4-year-old. At that age, kids are still learning social boundaries and how to express their feelings. The parent is trying to teach their daughter to protect herself from unwanted physical contact, which is important. But is teaching a child to use physical force the right approach?\n\nThe parent mentions that the child already told the teachers, but the teachers aren't seeing the behavior, and the other kid isn't stopping. So the parent is trying to give their child a way to handle it if the adults aren't helping. The spouse's concern is about encouraging violence, even if it's in self-defense.\n\nI need to think about child development and parenting strategies. At 4, kids might not know how to handle such situations. Teaching a child to use force might set a bad precedent, but on the other hand, it's important for them to feel empowered to say no to unwanted touch. The key here is the type of force. The parent is instructing to push away, not hit or hurt, but just to remove themselves from the situation. However, if the other child pushes back, the advice is to push back again. That could escalate the situation into a fight, which is not ideal for a daycare setting.\n\nThere's also the consideration of how to handle such issues in daycare. Maybe the parent should have worked more directly with the daycare teachers to address the problem instead of teaching their child to handle it physically. The parent might be trying to empower the child, but maybe there's a better way, like role-playing how to say \"no\" or \"stop\" and then seeking help from a teacher.\n\nThe spouse's argument is about non-violence. The parent argues they are teaching legitimate self-defense. But with young kids, even minor physical actions can be seen as aggressive. The daycare's role is to manage such interactions, so maybe the parent should have involved them more thoroughly before teaching their child to act on her own.\n\nAlso, the child's safety is a priority. If the other child is not respecting boundaries and the daycare isn't addressing it, the parent is trying to protect their child. But the method might not be the best. The parent's intention is good, but the approach might be flawed because it could lead to more conflict or the child using force in other situations.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the parent might be in the wrong for advising physical force, even if the intention was to protect their child. It's possible that a better approach would be to reinforce communication skills and ensure the daycare is more proactive in monitoring the interactions. The spouse's perspective of non-violence and relying on adults to handle the situation is also valid in this context.\n"
