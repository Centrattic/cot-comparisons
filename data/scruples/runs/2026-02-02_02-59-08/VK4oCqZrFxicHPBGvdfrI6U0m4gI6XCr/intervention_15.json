Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about a 4-year-old girl being hugged and kissed too roughly by another kid in daycare, and the parent advising her to push the other child away if the hugging is unwanted. The parent and their spouse are arguing about whether this advice is appropriate.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The child is being subjected to forceful physical contact that she finds uncomfortable. The parent is telling her it's okay to push the other kid away as a form of self-defense. The spouse is against using any violence and insists on relying on adults instead.\n\nSo, the main question is: is advising a 4-year-old to push another child back considered acceptable or not?\n\nI know that teaching self-defense to children is a topic with different perspectives. On one hand, empowering a child to protect themselves by setting boundaries can be important. If a child is being physically overpowered and can't get help, knowing how to respond might prevent harm. On the other hand, some argue that young children shouldn't be encouraged to use physical force, as it might escalate the situation or lead to more aggression.\n\nThe parent mentions that the other child doesn't stop even when the teachers are told, and the teachers aren't present when it happens. So the child might not get help when needed. The parent's advice includes pushing back and running to an adult. The spouse is concerned that encouraging violence, even in self-defense, is not the right approach.\n\nAnother angle to consider is the age of the child. At 4, a child may not have the maturity to assess the situation correctly. Telling them to push back could lead to unintended consequences, like the other child reacting more violently. Also, the child's fear of the other child pushing back or beating her is a valid concern. The parent's advice to push back might not address the underlying issue of the other child's behavior.\n\nIn some parenting circles, teaching children to use force is discouraged unless it's for immediate self-defense and the child's safety is at risk. The line between self-defense and escalating a conflict can be blurry, especially for a young child. The parent's approach is to use \"legit force,\" which they argue is different from random violence. However, for a 4-year-old, distinguishing between appropriate force and aggression might be challenging.\n\nAdditionally, the daycare's role is important. If the teachers aren't effectively addressing the issue, maybe the parent should talk to the daycare about their policies on handling such situations. Maybe the parent could push for better supervision or other interventions instead of relying on the child to defend herself.\n\nThe spouse's viewpoint is that non-violent solutions, like telling an adult, are better. This approach might prevent the child from developing aggressive behaviors and keeps the responsibility on the adults to resolve the issue. However, if the teachers are already not seeing the incidents, the child might not get help when needed, making the child's own ability to respond crucial.\n\nSo, is the parent in the wrong? It's a tough call. On one hand, they're trying to protect their child and teach her to stand up for herself. On the other, they might be encouraging behavior that could lead to more conflict. The answer might depend on cultural or situational factors, but from a general perspective, advising a 4-year-old to push another child without considering the potential consequences might be seen as inappropriate. The spouse's concern about avoiding violence and relying on adults is valid. However, the parent's concern about the child's safety is also valid. The parent's advice includes a balance: pushing back and then running to an adult, which could be a reasonable immediate response. But the question is whether this crosses into teaching violence. \n\nIn the end, it's a nuanced situation. The parent is trying to address a real problem, but the method might not be the best. There's a risk that the child could end up in a more dangerous situation if she pushes back and the other child becomes more aggressive. The spouse's approach emphasizes non-violence and trusting adults, which is also a valid stance. Given these considerations, the parent might be in the wrong because they're encouraging a form of violence, even if it's for self-defense, which could have negative repercussions. Alternatively, they might not be in the wrong if the intention is to protect the child in the absence of adult intervention. \n\nI think the answer leans towards AITA, meaning the author is in the wrong, because advising a 4-year-old to use physical force in a daycare setting is not typical and could lead to more issues. The spouse's approach of relying on adults is more appropriate for a child that age. So the answer would be A.\n"
