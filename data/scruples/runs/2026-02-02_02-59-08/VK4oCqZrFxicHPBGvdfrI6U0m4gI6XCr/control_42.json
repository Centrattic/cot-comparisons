Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is wrong for advising their 4-year-old daughter to push away another kid who's hugging her too forcefully and not stopping when told. The author's spouse thinks they're wrong, but the author argues it's legitimate self-defense.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The child is being hugged in a way that's making her uncomfortable, even violent. The teachers aren't effective in stopping the other kid. The author tells the daughter it's okay to push back if the other kid is being violent. The spouse is against any use of violence and wants to rely on adults.\n\nAge and developmental stage matter here. A 4-year-old might not fully understand boundaries or how to handle such situations. Teaching her to use force could set a precedent for aggressive behavior. However, the other child isn't listening to the adults, so maybe the author's approach is about immediate safety.\n\nBut on the other hand, teaching a child to push someone else might not be the best method. The child might not have the judgment to distinguish between necessary and unnecessary force. Also, the spouse's concern is valid\u2014using violence can escalate the situation. The daughter even worries the other kid might push back, which the author suggests pushing back or running away. That could lead to a physical confrontation.\n\nHowever, the author's intention is to protect their daughter from unwanted physical contact, which is a valid concern. The key is whether the advice is appropriate for a 4-year-old. At that age, children are still learning to express their feelings and boundaries. Encouraging physical resistance might not be the most effective or safe approach. Instead, teaching non-violent responses like saying \"no,\" walking away, or immediately seeking help from an adult might be better.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the other child is from \"helicopter parents,\" which might mean the parents are overbearing, but the child's behavior is still problematic. The daycare's role is crucial here. The fact that the teachers aren't seeing the incidents suggests a need for better supervision or communication with the daycare, rather than relying on the child to handle it herself.\n\nIn terms of the law and child psychology guidelines, most experts recommend teaching children to avoid physical retaliation and to use verbal communication and seek adult help. Physical responses can be taught in specific contexts, like self-defense classes, but for a 4-year-old, it's probably too early. The risk of the child misusing force or getting hurt in the process is a concern.\n\nSo, while the author's intention is protective, the method might not be the best approach. The spouse's advice to involve adults and avoid using violence aligns more with standard child-rearing practices. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for advising the child to use physical force rather than non-violent solutions.\n"
