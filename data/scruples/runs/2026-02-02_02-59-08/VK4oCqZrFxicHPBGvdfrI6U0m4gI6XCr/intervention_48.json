Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves a 4-year-old girl who's being hugged too hard by another kid, sometimes with kisses, and the parents are discussing how to handle it.\n\nFirst, the parent encourages the daughter to push the other kid away if she's uncomfortable. The spouse disagrees, saying it's better to tell the teachers and avoid violence. The parent argues that it's about using \"legit force\" to stop someone from forcing themselves on her. The core issue here is whether teaching a 4-year-old to use physical force is appropriate.\n\nI need to consider child safety and social norms. At 4 years old, children are still learning how to express their boundaries. Teaching a child to push another kid might model aggressive behavior, even if the intent is to stop something uncomfortable. However, the other child isn't backing off when told, so the parent is trying to empower their daughter to protect herself.\n\nOn one hand, promoting non-violent solutions (like telling a teacher) is often recommended in early childhood education. Teachers are there to manage such interactions and intervene. On the other hand, if the daughter is being subjected to unwanted physical contact that she can't stop by just telling the other child to stop, then some form of self-defense might be justified. But for a 4-year-old, the appropriate response might not be to push but to seek help immediately.\n\nThe parent's advice could lead to the child using physical force, which might escalate the situation or lead to the child being seen as aggressive. However, the parent is also trying to teach the child about personal boundaries and self-advocacy, which is important. The spouse's concern is about modeling non-violence, which is a valid point in child development.\n\nThere's a balance between teaching a child to stand up for themselves and ensuring they don't resort to violence. Since the daughter is already reporting the issue to teachers without success, maybe the parent's approach is a reaction to the lack of adult intervention. However, the parent's solution might not be the best method for a 4-year-old. Maybe a better approach would be to reinforce the message to tell a teacher every time, even if it happens again, rather than using physical force. The parent's advice might be too direct for the child's age and could lead to unintended consequences, like the child becoming more aggressive in other situations.\n\nIn summary, while the parent's intention is to protect the child, the method might not be age-appropriate or the best strategy. The spouse's approach of relying on adult intervention is more in line with typical child guidance practices. So, the parent might be in the wrong for encouraging physical action instead of non-violent means.\n"
