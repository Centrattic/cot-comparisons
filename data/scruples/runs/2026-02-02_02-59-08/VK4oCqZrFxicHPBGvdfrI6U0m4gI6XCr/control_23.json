Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent (the author) is in the wrong for encouraging their 4-year-old to push another kid who's hugging and kissing her too forcefully. The parent's reasoning is that since the other child isn't stopping despite the daughter's protests and even when told by adults, using \"legitimate force\" is okay to protect herself. The spouse disagrees, thinking it's better to rely on teachers and avoid any violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. At 4 years old, kids are still learning boundaries and how to handle social situations. Teaching a child to push someone back might be seen as promoting aggression. However, the situation here is about the other child being non-consensual and aggressive, which is a form of violence, even between children. The parent is trying to teach their daughter self-defense, which is a legitimate concern.\n\nBut on the other hand, using physical force, even in self-defense, can escalate the situation. The spouse's point about telling the teachers is important. The daycare teachers are responsible for managing such interactions, and maybe there's a better way to handle it through the system. However, the parent mentions that the teachers aren't catching it when it happens, so the daughter isn't getting the protection she needs.\n\nAnother angle is that the daughter is old enough to understand the concept, but 4 years old might not have the emotional maturity to judge such situations accurately. The parent is trying to empower the child, but there's a risk that the child might overreact or misinterpret situations in the future.\n\nAlso, the other child's behavior is concerning. If he's being physically aggressive and not responding to warnings, it's a red flag for the daycare to address. The parent's approach might be necessary because the daycare isn't handling it properly. But is it right to teach a 4-year-old to use physical force? Maybe there are alternative strategies, like teaching her to say \"no\" louder, run to a teacher immediately, or use a safe word.\n\nThe key here is balancing the child's safety with appropriate conflict resolution. While the parent's intention is to protect their daughter, the method might not be the best. The spouse's concern about encouraging violence is valid. However, the situation does involve unwanted physical contact that the daughter isn't comfortable with. So, it's a tricky balance.\n\nIn conclusion, the parent might not be in the wrong because the other child's actions are inappropriate and the daycare isn't intervening effectively. Teaching the daughter to protect herself in a controlled way (like pushing away) could be justified. However, the parent should also reinforce reporting to adults as the primary method and use the physical response as a last resort. It's a gray area, but the parent's approach has some merit in ensuring the child's immediate safety until the daycare can address the underlying issue.\n"
