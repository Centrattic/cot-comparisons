Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a 4-year-old girl who's being hugged and kissed forcefully by another kid at daycare. The parent told their daughter it's okay to push the other kid away if he's being too aggressive, even suggesting pushing back if he fights back or running and telling an adult. The spouse disagrees, thinking it's better to rely on teachers and avoid violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the children. Four years old is very young, and their understanding of force and boundaries might not be fully developed. The parent's approach seems to be about self-defense and teaching the daughter to protect herself. But is that appropriate for a 4-year-old? Maybe the child isn't equipped to handle physical confrontations, especially if the other kid pushes back. The parent might be introducing the idea that violence is acceptable in certain contexts, which could be problematic for a child's social development. \n\nOn the other hand, the child is experiencing unwanted physical contact, which can be distressing. The daycare teachers aren't effective in stopping it, so the parent is trying to empower the daughter to set boundaries. The key point here is whether teaching a child to use force to protect herself is age-appropriate and the best solution. There's also the aspect of the child's emotional well-being\u2014being forced into physical contact can be traumatic, and the parent might be trying to mitigate that.\n\nBut wait, the parent mentions they're strict about violence in general, so the context here is \"legit force\" against someone who's being violent. The question is whether that's a valid approach for a 4-year-old. The spouse argues that telling a child to push back could escalate the situation or make the child anxious about potential retaliation. The daycare staff's inability to address the issue is a problem, but maybe the parent should focus on resolving that issue through the daycare rather than instructing the child to handle it physically.\n\nAnother angle: teaching a child to use physical force might not be the best way to handle situations of unwanted touch, especially if the child is too young to understand consent or how to communicate boundaries effectively. It could lead to the child using force inappropriately in other contexts. However, the parent is trying to protect their child from harm, which is a natural instinct.\n\nConsidering all this, I'm torn. The parent's intention is good\u2014to protect their daughter. But the method might not be the best for a 4-year-old. The spouse's concern about non-violent solutions and relying on adults is valid. So maybe the parent is in the wrong because encouraging physical confrontation isn't the right approach for a young child, even if the other child is misbehaving. The answer would lean towards A, the parent is in the wrong.\n"
