Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for advising their 4-year-old daughter to push away another kid who's hugging her too forcefully. The situation is that the other child keeps hugging and kissing her in a way that's uncomfortable, even after she tells him to stop. The parents have already told the teachers, but it's not stopping. The author told their daughter it's okay to push him away, even if he might push back, advising her to push back or run away.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are about the appropriateness of teaching a 4-year-old to use force in self-defense. On one hand, the parent is trying to protect their child from unwanted physical contact, which is important. Children should feel empowered to set boundaries. But at 4 years old, do they understand the concept of using force appropriately? Also, using physical force might escalate the situation. The parent argues that it's about \"legit violence\" in a situation where someone is being violent towards their daughter. But teaching a child to respond with force could be seen as promoting aggression, even if it's in self-defense.\n\nThe other parent (the SO) is against it, suggesting that reporting to teachers is better and avoiding violence altogether. The daycare might have specific protocols for handling such situations. The daughter's age is crucial here. A 4-year-old might not have the judgment to differentiate between appropriate self-defense and escalating a conflict. Also, if the other child is acting out due to behavioral issues, maybe there's an underlying problem that the daycare should address, not just the children's interactions.\n\nI think the parent is trying to protect their child's autonomy, which is good, but the method of teaching physical resistance might not be the best approach for a young child. The daycare's role is to manage these interactions, and involving them more systematically might be more effective. Additionally, the child might not be emotionally mature enough to handle the consequences of pushing back, leading to more fear or aggression in interactions. So, maybe the author is in the wrong by encouraging physical confrontation instead of focusing on communication and reporting to adults. Therefore, the answer would be A.\n"
