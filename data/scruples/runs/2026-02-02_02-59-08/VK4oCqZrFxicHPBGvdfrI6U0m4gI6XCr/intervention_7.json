Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The scenario involves their 4-year-old daughter being hugged and kissed forcefully by another kid at daycare, despite the daughter's protests. The parent advised the child to push the other kid away if the behavior continued, suggesting that it's okay to use \"legit force\" in self-defense. The spouse disagrees, thinking they should rely on teachers and avoid any violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. At 4 years old, kids are still learning social boundaries and conflict resolution. The other child's behavior is aggressive and persistent, which the daycare teachers haven't effectively managed. The parent's approach is to teach the daughter to defend herself physically if necessary, emphasizing that it's okay to push back if the other child is being violent.\n\nOn the other hand, the spouse's argument is about non-violence and relying on adults. The parent argues that the child is old enough to understand the difference between justified force (like self-defense) and random violence. The key here is the concept of self-defense for a young child. While the parent is trying to empower the daughter to protect herself, they have to consider the child's ability to handle such situations. A 4-year-old might not have the maturity to discern when to use force appropriately. Pushing back could escalate the situation into a physical altercation, which might cause more harm than good. Additionally, even if the parent's intention is self-defense, teaching a young child to use physical force could set a precedent for resolving conflicts through violence, which isn't ideal for social development.\n\nAnother angle is the daycare's responsibility. The parent mentioned that the teachers haven't intervened effectively. The correct approach might be to escalate the issue to the daycare management or parents of the aggressive child to address the root cause. The parent's solution, while well-intentioned, bypasses the system meant to handle such issues in educational settings. It's possible that the daycare hasn't been adequately informed or that more structured interventions are needed.\n\nAlso, the child's emotional state is a factor. The daughter is already feeling uncomfortable and has expressed fear that the other child might retaliate. Teaching a child to push back could lead to anxiety about potential fights, which isn't healthy. Instead, reinforcing non-violent strategies like walking away, seeking help, or using words might be more appropriate for a 4-year-old.\n\nIn terms of legal or ethical standards, while the parent is trying to protect their child, the method might not align with recommended child-rearing practices. Experts often advise against encouraging children to use physical force unless it's an absolute last resort and they're properly taught how to do so safely. The parent's advice to push back and run away might be seen as promoting violence, even if justified, which could conflict with the spouse's values and the overall goal of preventing conflict.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the parent's approach might be seen as in the wrong because it encourages a violent response to a situation that, although troubling, could be better addressed through non-violent means and proper channels. The child's safety is important, but the method used could lead to more problems. Therefore, the answer would lean towards A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
