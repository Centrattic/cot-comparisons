Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for teaching their 4-year-old to push away another child who's hugging and kissing her too forcefully. The parents had a fight over this. The key points here are the child's safety, the situation described, and the advice given.\n\nFirst, the other child's behavior is described as \"violently hugging\" and kissing her, which the daughter finds uncomfortable. The daughter tried telling the teachers, but they didn't intervene effectively. The parent told the daughter it's okay to push back if someone is hurting her and not stopping, even advising to push back or run and tell an adult if the other child retaliates.\n\nThe spouse thinks it's better to go to teachers and avoid any violence. The parent argues that it's about using legitimate force when needed, as the daughter is capable of understanding the difference.\n\nNow, considering the age of the child, 4 years old is quite young. Teaching a child to use physical force might escalate the situation or lead to unintended consequences. However, the parent's intent was to protect their daughter from unwanted physical contact, which is valid. The issue here is whether the advice given was appropriate for a 4-year-old to handle on her own.\n\nThe parent's advice includes pushing away and if needed, pushing back or running away. But at that age, children might not have the judgment to assess when it's appropriate to use force and when it's not. There's a risk of the situation escalating into a physical altercation that the child can't control. Also, the daycare staff's role is to manage such situations, and the parent is bypassing that by teaching the child to handle it herself.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent is trying to empower the child to protect herself when the system (teachers not intervening) isn't working. It's a valid concern that the child should know how to advocate for her boundaries. However, the method of teaching her to push back might not be the best approach for a 4-year-old. The spouse's concern about using violence at any age is also valid, especially in a daycare setting where staff are supposed to manage interactions.\n\nThe parent mentions they are strict about not using violence, but in this case, the justification is for self-defense. The line between teaching self-defense and encouraging violence is thin here. Given the child's age and the environment, the parent's approach could be seen as inappropriate because it's not teaching non-violent conflict resolution first. The daycare's responsibility is to ensure the safety of all children, so relying on the child to handle it might not be the best solution.\n\nIn conclusion, while the parent's intentions are good, the approach might not be the most effective or safe for a 4-year-old. The spouse's point about going to teachers first is more appropriate, as that's part of the daycare's role. Therefore, the parent could be in the wrong for advising physical action in this context. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
