Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who asked for advice is in the wrong for encouraging their 4-year-old to push another kid who's hugging her too hard. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The child at daycare is being hugged forcefully by another kid, which is causing discomfort. The parent told their daughter it's okay to push back if the other kid won't stop, even if the other kid might push back. The spouse disagrees, thinking they should only tell the teachers and avoid using violence.\n\nSo, the question is whether teaching a 4-year-old to use force in this situation is wrong. \n\nOn one hand, the child is being subjected to unwanted physical contact, which can be a form of bullying or inappropriate behavior. The daycare teachers aren't effectively addressing it, so the parent wants their daughter to protect herself. Teaching a child to set boundaries and defend herself might be seen as necessary to prevent harm.\n\nOn the other hand, encouraging a 4-year-old to use physical force could lead to more conflict, maybe escalate the situation. At that age, children might not have the emotional maturity to handle such interactions appropriately. Also, teaching violence as a solution might set a bad precedent. The parent's spouse argues for non-violent solutions, like reporting to teachers, which is the standard advice in many parenting guides.\n\nBut the parent argues that the situation involves \"legit violence\" and that the child needs to protect herself. However, a forced hug, even if painful, is not exactly the same as physical assault. The line between defense and aggression can be blurry for a young child. The parent might be overestimating the danger their daughter faces, and the solution could lead to more problems in the daycare environment.\n\nAlso, considering the age, 4-year-olds are still learning social skills. Teachers and caregivers should handle such issues. The parent might be right to teach self-defense, but the method might be too aggressive for the child's age and context.\n\nIn some cases, it's recommended that young children learn to say \"no\" and seek help from adults rather than using physical force. So, the parent's approach might not be the best, even if the intention is good. The spouse's concern about using violence is valid because it can lead to a cycle of aggression and might not teach the child how to resolve conflicts without physical means.\n\nTherefore, the parent might be in the wrong for advising physical resistance in this specific scenario. The correct approach would be to focus on non-violent methods, like teaching the child to firmly say \"no,\" pull away, and immediately go to a trusted adult for help. The parent's method could set a dangerous example and might not be age-appropriate.\n"
