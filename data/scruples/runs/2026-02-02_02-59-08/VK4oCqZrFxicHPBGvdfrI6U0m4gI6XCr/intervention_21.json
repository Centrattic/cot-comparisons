Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The parent is advising their 4-year-old daughter to push away another child who's hugging her too roughly and even kissing her. The parent believes it's okay to use force when someone is hurting their child and not stopping despite being told. The spouse disagrees, saying it's better to tell a teacher instead of using violence.\n\nFirst, the child is very young, only 4. At that age, kids might not fully understand the nuances of social interactions or how to handle conflicts. The parent is teaching the child to use physical force as a response. But is this appropriate? The other child's actions could be considered inappropriate, but teaching a 4-year-old to push back might escalate the situation or lead to more aggression. Also, the daycare teachers aren't effectively managing the behavior, which is a problem.\n\nThe parent argues it's about \"legit violence,\" meaning self-defense. However, even in self-defense scenarios, teaching a child to use force without considering the potential consequences (like hurting the other child or getting hurt in return) might not be the best approach. The parent's spouse is concerned about promoting non-violence, which is a common parenting approach. \n\nBut the child is being subjected to unwanted physical contact. The parent wants to empower her to set boundaries. However, the method of doing so through pushing might not be the safest or most effective. The daycare's inaction is a separate issue, but the parent might need to address that more directly, like involving the teachers or daycare administration more thoroughly instead of instructing the child to handle it herself.\n\nAlso, the child's fear of retaliation (the other kid pushing back) is a valid concern. Teaching the child to push back could lead to a cycle of violence. The parent's advice to \"push back and run away\" might not be age-appropriate. At 4, kids often don't have the impulse control to manage that effectively. They might escalate the conflict instead of de-escalating it.\n\nOn the other hand, teaching the child to assert boundaries is important. The question is whether physical force is the right method. Maybe non-violent techniques like saying \"no,\" walking away, or seeking an adult's help would be better. The parent's approach might be well-intentioned but could model aggressive behavior even in self-defense situations.\n\nIn terms of legal or moral responsibility, in some cultures, teaching a child to defend themselves is acceptable. But in others, especially in early childhood, the emphasis is on non-violence and communication. The daycare's role is also crucial here. If they're not addressing the issue adequately, the parent might need to escalate the problem to the daycare's management rather than relying on the child to handle it.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the parent's advice might be seen as promoting violence even if it's in response to unwanted touch. The spouse's concern about using non-violent methods aligns with common parenting advice for young children. Therefore, the parent might be in the wrong for teaching the child to use physical force instead of focusing on communication and involving adults.\n"
