Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the parent (the author) is in the wrong for telling their 4-year-old daughter it's okay to push away another kid who's hugging her too roughly. The parent's spouse is upset about this, saying they should focus on non-violence and involving teachers instead. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The other child is physically forcing hugging and kissing on the daughter, which is making her uncomfortable. The daughter has already told the teachers, but they don't see it happen, and the behavior continues. The parent is advising the child to use force to defend herself, which is a form of self-defense. \n\nBut at 4 years old, children are still learning how to handle social situations. The parent's approach is about self-defense: if someone is being violent, it's okay to push them away. The spouse is concerned about teaching the child to use violence in any form. There's a difference between teaching self-defense and encouraging aggression. \n\nI need to think about child development. At 4, kids might not have the emotional or physical maturity to handle defending themselves in such a situation. Even though the behavior is unwanted, the parent is trying to empower the child to protect herself when adults aren't around. But the spouse's argument is that the child might escalate the situation by pushing back, leading to more aggression. Also, the idea of using force at that age might be seen as promoting violence, which could conflict with their parenting values.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent is trying to protect their child from harm. The other child's actions could be considered a form of violence, especially since the child is being forced to interact physically. Teaching self-defense in this context might be necessary. However, the parent's approach could also be seen as too direct for a 4-year-old, who might not understand the nuances of using force appropriately. \n\nAnother angle is the role of authority figures. The teachers are supposed to handle such situations, but they aren't effective here. The parent is trying to fill that gap. But maybe the parent should have focused more on strategies other than physical resistance, like verbal cues or immediate reporting. \n\nThere's also the question of setting a precedent. If a parent teaches a child to use force, does that set a pattern for future interactions where the child might use force unnecessarily? The spouse's concern might be about that. However, the parent is specifically addressing a situation of forced interaction where the child is being hurt, so the force is a response to direct harm. \n\nI think the key here is whether the parent's advice is proportionate. Teaching a child to push away someone who is being physically aggressive might be a necessary self-defense measure. However, at 4 years old, the ability to discern when it's appropriate to use such a response could be developing. The parent might be overestimating the child's ability to handle the situation, or underestimating the risk of escalation. \n\nThe spouse's view is that non-violent solutions should be the focus, but when those aren't working, maybe a balance is needed. The parent isn't advocating for beating the child up but using force to stop unwanted contact. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, many parents would agree that teaching a child to protect themselves from harm is important, but others might prefer not to introduce any form of physical defense at that age. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nSo, considering all that, the parent is trying to protect their child from physical harm and teaching self-defense, which could be seen as right. But the spouse's concern about promoting violence and not trusting the child's ability to handle it is also valid. \n\nI think the answer is that the parent isn't entirely in the wrong, but they might have taken an approach that's a bit too direct for a 4-year-old. However, the situation is abusive, so teaching self-defense is justified. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
