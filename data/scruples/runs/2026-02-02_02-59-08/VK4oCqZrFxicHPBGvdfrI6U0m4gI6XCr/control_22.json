Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the parent (the author) is wrong for telling their 4-year-old daughter to push away another kid who's hugging her too hard and forcing kisses. The parent's partner thinks they're wrong to encourage any violence, while the author argues it's about legitimate self-defense.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the child's age. Four years old is very young, and their ability to understand and handle such situations might be limited. The child was already reporting the issue to teachers, but the problem persists. The author is teaching the daughter to use force when she's being forced, which is a form of self-defense. However, the partner argues that using violence to solve problems isn't appropriate for a child, even in self-defense.\n\nI should think about how children are typically taught to handle such situations. Usually, the advice is to teach them to tell a trusted adult or use their words. Introducing the idea of pushing back might be seen as promoting aggressive behavior, even if it's in response to aggression. At this age, kids might not fully grasp the nuances of when and how to use force, which could escalate the situation. The partner's concern is valid because mixing violence, even as a response, can be confusing for a young child.\n\nAlso, the daycare's role is important. If the teachers aren't addressing it adequately, the parent might feel the need to teach their child to defend herself. But the parent's responsibility is to ensure that their child learns non-violent conflict resolution. The author's approach might be seen as overstepping, as the child's safety should be addressed through the daycare's policies and communication with the teachers, not by encouraging the child to retaliate.\n\nAnother angle: the child might not have the emotional maturity to assess when it's appropriate to push someone. There's a risk that the child could act impulsively or misinterpret other situations as needing force. The partner's approach of emphasizing telling adults aligns with standard child safety protocols, which prioritize reporting over self-defense, especially for young children.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intention is to protect their daughter, teaching a 4-year-old to use physical force might not be the best approach. The correct method should involve reinforcing communication with trusted adults and ensuring the daycare addresses the issue. So the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
