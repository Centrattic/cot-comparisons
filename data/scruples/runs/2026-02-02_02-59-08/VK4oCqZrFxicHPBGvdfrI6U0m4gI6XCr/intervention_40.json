Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their 4-year-old daughter to push away another kid who's hugging her too hard and sometimes kissing her without consent. The dad's main point is that if someone is hurting her and won't stop, it's okay to use force. The mom disagrees, saying they should only tell the teachers and avoid violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. A 4-year-old's ability to understand and handle such situations is limited. Even if the dad is trying to teach self-defense, the child might not have the maturity to assess when force is appropriate. The scenario mentions that the other kid is \"strange\" and \"rebellious,\" possibly indicating he might have behavioral issues. The dad's advice could escalate the situation because a 4-year-old pushing back might lead to a physical altercation, which could be dangerous for both kids.\n\nThen there's the aspect of consent. The other child is forcing hugs and kisses on the daughter, which is a form of non-consensual contact. The dad is right in that the child has the right to say no, but the method of response is debatable. Teaching a child to push back might not be the best approach because young children don't always know how to handle conflict. The teachers aren't effective in stopping the behavior, so maybe the parents need to take more proactive steps, like talking to the other parents or the daycare directly.\n\nAlso, the dad emphasizes that they're against violence in general, which is good. However, suggesting force in this specific case could contradict that value. The child might not understand the difference between defensive force and aggressive behavior. The mom's point about telling the teachers is valid because adults can handle the situation more effectively. The child is too young to manage such conflicts on her own, even with guidance.\n\nIn terms of child safety education, it's important to teach children their boundaries and how to assert them, but the methods should be appropriate for their age. Pushing might not be the safest or most effective strategy here. Encouraging the child to seek help from adults is more reliable. The dad's advice might lead to unintended consequences if the other child retaliates, as the daughter mentioned fearing that.\n\nSo, weighing all these factors, the dad's advice, while well-intentioned, might not be the best approach for a 4-year-old. The answer leans towards the author being in the wrong because the method suggested is not suitable for the child's age and the situation's potential risks.\n"
