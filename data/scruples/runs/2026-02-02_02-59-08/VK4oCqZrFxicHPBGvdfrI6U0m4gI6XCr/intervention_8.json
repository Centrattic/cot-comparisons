Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the parent is in the wrong here. The situation is about a 4-year-old girl who's being hugged too forcefully by another kid, and even kissed without her wanting. The parent told the daughter it's okay to push the kid away if it's uncomfortable and even to push back if the other kid responds, plus run away and tell an adult. The spouse disagrees, saying it's better to just tell the teachers and avoid violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the child's age and understanding. At 4, kids are still learning social boundaries and how to handle conflicts. The parent's advice is about self-defense, teaching the child to assert boundaries. But the question is whether encouraging physical pushing is appropriate. \n\nThe child is being asked to use force, which could escalate the situation. Kids at that age might not have the emotional control to assess when to stop. Even though the parent's intention is to protect the child, teaching a young child to use violence might lead to unintended consequences, like the other child getting hurt or the situation becoming more confrontational.\n\nOn the other hand, the other kid isn't stopping when told, and the teachers aren't catching it. The parent's approach gives the child a way to take immediate action to protect herself, which might be necessary when adults aren't around. The key is whether the parent's advice is proportionate. Pushing back could be seen as a reasonable defense against unwanted, forceful contact, especially if it's non-aggressive but firm.\n\nBut the spouse is right in that teaching non-violence is important. The parent might be modeling that using force is acceptable in certain situations, which could be confusing for a child. There's also the aspect of teaching the child to communicate and seek help first. However, in this case, the teachers aren't effective, so the child might need immediate tools.\n\nIt's a balance between teaching self-advocacy and avoiding violence. The parent's approach might be too aggressive for a 4-year-old, who might not understand the nuances. Maybe there are better alternatives, like teaching the child to say \"no\" firmly, use a barrier like a hand, or move away, rather than pushing. But the parent's advice is to push, which is a form of physical confrontation. \n\nConsidering all this, the parent might be in the wrong because encouraging a young child to use physical force could set a precedent for aggressive behavior. However, the parent's intent is to protect the child from unwanted contact. It's a tricky situation. The spouse's concern is valid because the child's safety is paramount, but the method might not be the best approach. So, the answer might lean towards the parent being in the wrong because the solution involves violence instead of non-violent means.\n"
