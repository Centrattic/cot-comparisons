Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for telling their 4-year-old to push away another kid who's hugging and kissing them too forcefully. The parent explained that the other child doesn't stop even when asked and the teachers aren't effective.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The child is being hugged and kissed in a way that's making them uncomfortable, even painful. The parent is teaching their daughter to use \"legitimate force\" to defend herself. The spouse thinks it's better to rely on teachers and avoid violence. \n\nAt 4 years old, the child is very young. The parent is trying to empower her to stand up for herself, which could be seen as teaching self-defense. But there's also a risk that the child might escalate the situation, especially since the other kid might react by pushing back. The parent's advice includes pushing back or running to an adult, which seems reasonable in the context of immediate safety.\n\nHowever, teaching a 4-year-old to use physical force could have unintended consequences. The child might not understand the boundaries well enough, leading to more conflict. Also, the daycare's role is to manage such interactions, so maybe the parent should focus on ensuring the daycare is more vigilant or involving other authorities if needed.\n\nBut given that the other child's behavior is persistent and the teachers aren't stopping it, the parent's concern is valid. The key is whether the advice given is proportionate. Pushing away is a minimal form of force that could prevent harm. The parent emphasizes that the force is only when the other child is using violence, so it's self-defense.\n\nIn terms of child development, 4-year-olds do need to learn how to express discomfort and set boundaries, but physical confrontation might not be the best approach. However, the parent's intention is to protect their child from harm, which is a strong justification.\n\nConsidering all this, the parent's approach isn't wrong. They're addressing a legitimate issue where the child is being harmed and the existing measures aren't working. The advice is about immediate protection, not initiating violence. So the answer would be B, the parent is not in the wrong.\n"
