Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for advising their 4-year-old to use force against another child who's hugging/kissing her too roughly. The parent says the child already tried telling the teachers, but it didn't help. The parent's advice is to push back or run away if the other kid doesn't stop.\n\nFirst, I need to consider child development. A 4-year-old's understanding of boundaries and conflict resolution is still developing. Teaching a child to use physical force might set a precedent for using violence as a solution, even if it's in self-defense. There's a line between teaching self-defense and encouraging aggression. \n\nThe other child's behavior is concerning\u2014forceful hugging and kissing that's not consensual. The parent wants to protect their daughter from being harmed. However, advising a young child to push back might escalate the situation. The partner argues for non-violence and reporting to adults, which are standard approaches in schools to prevent cycles of violence.\n\nAlso, the daycare's role is important. If the teachers aren't addressing the issue despite being informed, maybe the parent should escalate to higher authorities or consider changing the daycare. But advising a child to use physical force could be seen as inappropriate, especially since the child is very young. It's possible that the parent is trying to empower the daughter, but the method might not be age-appropriate.\n\nThere's also the aspect of teaching consent and communication. Maybe there are better ways to teach the daughter to express her discomfort without resorting to physical actions. The parent's approach might be well-intentioned, but the method could lead to unintended consequences, like the child using force in other situations.\n\nIn terms of societal norms and child-rearing practices, many experts advise against teaching young children to use physical force. Instead, they promote verbal communication and seeking help from adults. The parent's solution might conflict with these guidelines, suggesting the parent is in the wrong. However, if the daycare isn't effective, maybe the parent isn't entirely wrong in trying to protect their child.\n\nBut ultimately, the parent's advice could model aggressive behavior, which is generally discouraged in early childhood education. So, the answer might lean towards the parent being in the wrong (A), but there's nuance. However, based on the questioner's initial thought and the common advice to avoid teaching violence, the answer is likely A.\n"
