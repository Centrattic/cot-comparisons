Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the parent is wrong for telling their 4-year-old to push another kid who's hugging her too hard and not stopping. The parent's partner thinks she should have just told the teachers, but the parent argues that the daughter is old enough to understand when it's okay to push back in self-defense.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. Four years old is pretty young. Their understanding of situations and the consequences of their actions might not be fully developed. Teaching a child to use force, even if it's justified, might have unintended effects. But on the other hand, the other kid is being aggressive and not respecting boundaries, which is a problem.\n\nThe daycare setting is important. Teachers are supposed to manage interactions, but in this case, they aren't seeing it or aren't effective. The parent might feel they need to step in because the system isn't working. However, the partner thinks the proper channel is to go through the teachers, which is the usual recommendation for such issues.\n\nSelf-defense for a child is a tricky topic. Some people believe that children should learn to assert themselves, but using physical force could escalate the situation. The parent is teaching the child to protect herself, which is a valid concern. But maybe there are other non-violent strategies, like teaching the child to say \"no\" more firmly or to move away, before resorting to pushing.\n\nAlso, the child's safety is the top priority. If the other kid becomes aggressive in response, the situation could get worse. The parent's advice to push back or run and tell an adult might be practical in the moment, but it's introducing the concept of using violence as a solution, which could influence the child's behavior in other contexts.\n\nThere's a balance between teaching self-defense and promoting non-violence. The parent believes the child can distinguish, but at four, that line might be blurry. The partner argues that relying on adults is better, which is the standard approach in most childcare settings. However, if the adults aren't effective, the parent feels they have no choice but to empower the child.\n\nI need to weigh the immediate safety and psychological impact. Teaching a child to push back might give her a sense of control, but it might also lead to retaliation or make her more aggressive. On the flip side, not teaching her to defend herself could lead to ongoing discomfort or trauma. The daycare's role is also critical\u2014maybe there's a need for more consistent supervision or intervention strategies from the staff.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, there's a debate about allowing children to handle conflicts themselves versus intervening. The parent is taking a middle ground, allowing the child to use force when necessary but not promoting violence. The partner is more strict about non-violence. Both have valid points, but the question is whether the parent's approach is wrong. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer might depend on cultural or personal beliefs. However, most child development experts would likely advise against encouraging physical responses and instead focus on communication and seeking help. So the parent might be in the wrong because they're promoting a violent solution that could have negative repercussions, even if the intent is to protect the child.\n"
