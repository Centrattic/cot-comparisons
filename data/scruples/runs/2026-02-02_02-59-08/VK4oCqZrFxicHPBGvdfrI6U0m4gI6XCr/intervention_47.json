Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The parent is advising their 4-year-old daughter to push away another kid who's hugging her too roughly and kissing her. The parent justifies this by saying it's legitimate violence if the other child is being violent. The spouse disagrees, thinking she should only tell the teachers.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the child's age. Four years old is very young. Their ability to handle conflict or recognize when to use force might not be developed enough. The parent is teaching the child to defend herself physically, which could be seen as teaching aggression or violence, especially at such a young age.\n\nThe situation involves another child's inappropriate behavior. The daughter has already told the teachers, but it's not working. The parent is worried the child might retaliate or escalate the situation. There's a risk that teaching a child to push back could lead to more physical altercations or teach the wrong lesson about handling conflicts.\n\nAlso, the parent mentions the child might think it's okay to use force here, but not in other situations. But children at 4 might not differentiate well. They might mimic the behavior in other contexts. The spouse is concerned about using violence at all, which is a valid point because teaching non-violent conflict resolution is usually encouraged in early childhood.\n\nHowever, the parent's intention is to protect their child from unwanted physical contact. The other child isn't stopping despite the daughter's protests and teacher interventions. So the parent is trying to empower the daughter to protect herself.\n\nBut considering the potential consequences, like the daughter getting hurt if the other child pushes back, or the daughter using force inappropriately, maybe the parent's approach is too aggressive. The better approach might be to reinforce verbal communication, teach the daughter to clearly say \"no\" and to tell an adult immediately, and work with the daycare to address the other child's behavior, maybe involving the parents of the other child.\n\nSo, while the parent's intention is protective, the method of teaching physical resistance might not be appropriate for a 4-year-old. The spouse's concern about non-violence is valid. Therefore, the parent might be in the wrong for encouraging physical force in this situation.\n"
