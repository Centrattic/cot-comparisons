Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent (the author) is in the wrong for advising their 4-year-old daughter to push away a classmate who's hugging her too forcefully and not respecting her boundaries. The partner disagrees, thinking the child should only tell a teacher, not use violence.\n\nFirst, the situation involves a young child experiencing unwanted physical contact from another child. The author's approach is about allowing the child to use \"legitimate force\" to defend herself when the other kid won't stop despite being asked. The partner is against using any form of violence, emphasizing non-violent solutions like reporting to teachers.\n\nNow, considering the age of the children, 4 years old, they're still learning social boundaries and how to handle conflicts. The other child's actions\u2014forceful hugs and kisses that the daughter doesn't want\u2014are a form of unwanted physical contact, which can be considered a form of bullying or at least a boundary issue. The teachers aren't effectively addressing it, so the daughter's options are limited.\n\nThe parent is teaching self-defense in a way that's appropriate for a young child. Pushing someone away in this context isn't aggressive violence; it's a defensive action to stop unwanted contact. The key here is that the parent is instructing the child to use force only when necessary and in a proportionate way (pushing back, not hitting). The parent also mentions that they're strict about avoiding violence in general, so this is a specific, justified exception.\n\nOn the other hand, the partner's concern is valid in that children should be encouraged to resolve conflicts without violence. However, in cases where the child's safety and comfort are at stake, teaching self-defense is a reasonable approach. The child is being taught to protect herself when other methods (telling the other child, telling a teacher) fail.\n\nIt's important to note that the parent isn't promoting aggression, but rather setting up a last-resort measure. The advice includes an option to run away and tell an adult, which adds another layer of safety. The child is old enough to understand the difference between defending herself and initiating violence, according to the parent, which is a reasonable assessment given the context.\n\nIn conclusion, the parent's advice is aimed at protecting the child's well-being and teaching her to respect her own boundaries. While there's a valid debate about the role of violence in conflict resolution for children, the parent is responding to a specific instance of unwanted forceful contact. Therefore, the parent is not in the wrong.\n"
