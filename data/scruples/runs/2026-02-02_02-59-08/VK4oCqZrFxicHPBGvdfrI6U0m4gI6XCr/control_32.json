Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for advising their 4-year-old daughter to push away another kid who's hugging and kissing her too roughly. The parent is concerned about their daughter's safety and autonomy, especially since the other child isn't stopping even after being told by the teachers. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from a child's perspective. At four years old, kids are still learning how to express their boundaries and handle social interactions. The other child's behavior is definitely not appropriate, especially since it's persistent and doesn't stop when the child is told to. The parent is teaching their daughter to protect herself, which is a natural instinct. But the spouse is worried about encouraging violence.\n\nNow, the parent's advice is about using \"legit force\" in a specific situation where the other child is being violent. They're not advocating for random aggression but teaching self-defense. The daughter is being told to push back if she's being forced and to run away or tell an adult if needed. The parent also emphasizes that it's about protecting herself, not starting a fight.\n\nOn the other hand, the spouse's concern is valid. Teaching a young child to use physical force could have unintended consequences, like escalating the situation or teaching the wrong lesson about handling conflicts. However, in this case, the parent is responding to a specific problem where the child is being physically overwhelmed and isn't getting help from the adults in charge.\n\nThe daycare's failure to address the issue is a key point. The parent is trying to empower their child to protect herself in an environment where the authority isn't resolving the problem. The advice given seems to be about self-defense rather than aggression. The parent also mentions that they're careful about teaching violence in general, so this is a specific case where they see a need for it.\n\nConsidering all factors, the parent's actions are aimed at protecting their child from unwanted physical contact and teaching her to assert her boundaries. While there's a valid debate about the role of violence in conflict resolution for children, the parent's intent here is to prevent harm. The situation isn't about bullying or aggression from the daughter but about defending against unwanted and forceful actions from another child. Therefore, the parent's advice seems reasonable in the context provided. So, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
