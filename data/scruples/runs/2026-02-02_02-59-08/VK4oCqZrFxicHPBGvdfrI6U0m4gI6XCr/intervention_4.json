Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for telling their 4-year-old daughter it's okay to push away another kid who's hugging and kissing her too forcefully. The parent is getting into an argument with their spouse over this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The other kid is being physically affectionate in a way that's making the daughter uncomfortable. The daughter has already told the teachers, but it's not stopping. The parent is advising her to push back if she's being hurt and not stop. The spouse argues that they should rely on telling adults instead of using violence.\n\nSo, what are the key points here? The child is 4 years old. At that age, children are still learning how to handle social interactions and express their boundaries. The parent is teaching their daughter to use physical force as a means of self-defense. But is that appropriate?\n\nOn one hand, the parent is trying to empower their daughter to protect herself when she's being subjected to unwanted physical contact. The parent might feel that the situation is escalating and that the teachers aren't effective in stopping the other child's behavior. The advice given seems to be about using force only when necessary and in a way that's defensive.\n\nOn the other hand, teaching a 4-year-old to use physical force could have unintended consequences. It might lead to more aggression or conflict. The spouse is concerned about promoting violence, even if it's defensive. There's also the question of whether a 4-year-old can accurately assess when force is necessary and how to respond appropriately without escalating the situation.\n\nThe parent also mentions that they are otherwise strict about not using violence towards other kids. This suggests that the advice is specific to this situation where the child is being forced into unwanted contact. However, even in such cases, teaching a young child to push back might not be the best approach. It could lead to more harm, like the other child retaliating or the situation becoming more aggressive than necessary.\n\nAdditionally, the daycare teachers not seeing the problem is a problem in itself. The parent might be right in thinking that the teachers aren't doing enough, but the solution of teaching the child to push back might not be the best course. Maybe there are other steps they could take, like discussing it more with the daycare, involving the other child's parents, or seeking additional support.\n\nAnother angle is the psychological impact on the daughter. If she feels she has to use force to protect herself, does that instill fear or a sense of empowerment? It's a delicate balance. At 4 years old, children might not fully understand the nuances of force versus aggression. They might interpret the advice too broadly.\n\nThe parent's spouse is concerned about promoting any form of violence, even defensive. There's merit in that because violence can be cyclical. Teaching a child to respond to force with force might lead to more conflict. However, the parent is trying to teach self-defense in a specific context where the child is being overpowered.\n\nI think the parent's intention is good\u2014to protect their child from unwanted affection. But the method of teaching a 4-year-old to push back might not be the most effective or safest approach. The parent might not have considered the potential for escalation or the child's ability to handle such a situation. It's possible that non-violent strategies could be more effective, like teaching the daughter to use a firm voice to say \"no\" or to go tell a teacher immediately if the other child persists.\n\nIn conclusion, while the parent's concern is valid, the approach might be flawed. Encouraging a 4-year-old to use physical force to handle a peer issue could be seen as promoting violence, even if it's in self-defense. The spouse's perspective might be more in line with the developmental needs of a young child, emphasizing non-violent communication and seeking adult help. Therefore, the parent might be in the wrong for not considering the broader implications of their advice.\n"
