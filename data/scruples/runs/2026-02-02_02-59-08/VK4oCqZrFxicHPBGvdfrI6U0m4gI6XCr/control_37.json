Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent (author) is in the wrong for teaching their 4-year-old daughter to push away another kid who's hugging and kissing her forcefully. The parent and their spouse had a disagreement over this.\n\nFirst, the situation: the other child is being aggressive and not respecting the daughter's boundaries. The daughter has already told the teachers, but it's not stopping. The parent is advising her to push back if the kid won't stop, using \"legit force.\" The spouse argues against using any violence, even in self-defense.\n\nNow, considering a 4-year-old's ability to understand and apply such instructions. At that age, kids might not fully grasp the concept of self-defense versus aggression. The parent is trying to teach her to protect herself, which is a valid concern. However, advocating for physical response might escalate the situation or teach the child that violence is acceptable. Also, daycare rules and child safety protocols usually require reporting incidents to adults rather than handling them physically.\n\nAnother angle: the other child's behavior might indicate something the daycare should address more seriously\u2014maybe they need to intervene more effectively. The parent's approach could be seen as a temporary fix without addressing the root cause. The spouse's point about relying on teachers is a standard approach in such settings to ensure safety and proper conflict resolution.\n\nBut then again, the parent is trying to empower their child to set boundaries, which is important. However, at four years old, the child might not have the emotional maturity to assess when force is necessary or how to de-escalate properly. Pushing back could lead to more conflict, and the daycare might not handle it well if they're already not addressing the initial problem.\n\nLegal and ethical considerations: Teaching a child to use physical force to defend against unwanted contact might be seen as appropriate in preventing harm, but in a daycare setting, the responsibility is on the staff to manage such interactions. The parent's advice might conflict with the daycare's policies and could be seen as encouraging behavior that undermines authority.\n\nIn summary, while the parent's intention is to protect their child, the method might be inappropriate for a 4-year-old's development and the daycare environment. The spouse's concern about not using violence aligns with standard child-rearing practices in such settings, prioritizing reporting over physical confrontation. Therefore, the parent might be in the wrong for advocating physical resistance in this scenario.\n"
