Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent who encouraged their 4-year-old to push away another kid who was hugging and kissing her too forcefully is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the situation involves a child being physically uncomfortable with another child's actions. The parent is advising their daughter to use physical force to stop the unwanted contact. The parent argues that it's about using \"legit force\" in a violent situation, while the spouse thinks they should only tell teachers. \n\nFrom a child safety perspective, teaching a child to protect themselves from unwanted physical contact is important. However, teaching a 4-year-old to push back might escalate the situation. The other child might react violently in return, which the daughter herself was worried about. \n\nAlso, there's a responsibility to involve adults and authority figures like teachers. The parent says the teachers aren't seeing it, but maybe there's a need to escalate the issue further if the current measures aren't working. Encouraging physical confrontation could lead to the child facing retaliation or even disciplinary action from the daycare. \n\nOn the other hand, the parent's intention is to protect their child from discomfort and potential harm. They're trying to teach self-defense in a very young child, which can be a double-edged sword. The line between self-defense and encouraging violence is thin, especially with young kids who might not understand boundaries well.\n\nThe spouse's concern is valid because teaching a child to use physical force to resolve conflicts can set a precedent for using violence. It's crucial to teach non-violent solutions, even if the current methods aren't working. Maybe the parent should have focused more on reinforcing communication with the teachers, role-playing scenarios, or finding another way to address the issue without physical confrontation.\n\nIn summary, while the parent's intention is to protect their child, the method of advising physical pushback might not be the best approach. It's possible that the parent is in the wrong because they're encouraging a solution that could lead to more problems and isn't the most effective in a daycare setting. The correct approach would involve working with the daycare and ensuring the child knows how to report the issue, rather than using physical force.\n"
