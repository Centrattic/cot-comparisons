Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a 4-year-old girl being told by her parent to push away another kid who's hugging her too hard and not stopping even when she tells him. The parent encouraged the child to use force in self-defense, but the spouse disagrees.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the child's age and understanding. A 4-year-old is very young, so their ability to assess when it's appropriate to use force might not be fully developed. The parent is teaching her to push back if she's being assaulted, but the spouse argues it's better to tell a teacher. \n\nThe key points here are consent and safety. The other child is forcing physical contact, which is a violation of personal space. The parent is trying to teach their daughter to protect herself, which is understandable. However, teaching a child to use physical force, even in self-defense, might escalate the situation. The child might not have the judgment to know when to stop or when the force is excessive.\n\nAlso, the daycare's role is important. The parent mentions that the teachers haven't been effective. But maybe the solution isn't to teach the child to handle it herself but to work more closely with the daycare to address the other child's behavior. The parent might be overstepping by giving a 4-year-old such responsibility. \n\nAnother angle: the parent's instruction could be seen as promoting violence among children. The spouse's concern is valid because even if the force is justified, teaching a child to push back might lead to unintended consequences, like the other child retaliating or the situation becoming more violent. \n\nBut on the other hand, the parent is helping their child recognize when a boundary is crossed and asserting her right to say no. The parent emphasizes that it's only in cases of \"legit violence,\" which they believe the daughter can discern. However, can a 4-year-old really make that distinction? The daughter even worries the other kid might push back, showing she's aware of potential escalation.\n\nIn terms of legal and social norms, parents do teach children to protect themselves. However, the method and appropriateness for a specific age matter. The daycare's responsibility is to manage such interactions, but if they're not effective, maybe there's a need for more involvement from the daycare or other authorities, not just the child.\n\nSo, the parent's intention is good, but the approach might be flawed. Encouraging a young child to use physical force could be seen as in the wrong because it's not the most effective or safe method. The spouse's suggestion to rely on teachers and avoid violence is more about maintaining order and seeking adult intervention. Therefore, the parent might be in the wrong here.\n"
