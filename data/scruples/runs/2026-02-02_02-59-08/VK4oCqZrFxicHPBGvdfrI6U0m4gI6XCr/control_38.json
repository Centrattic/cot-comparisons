Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the parent is in the wrong here. The situation is about a 4-year-old girl who's being hugged and kissed too forcefully by another kid at daycare. The parents are disagreeing on how to handle it.\n\nFirst, the parent encouraged the daughter to push the other kid away if he's being too forceful. The other parent thinks the daughter should just tell the teachers and not use any violence. The key point here is whether it's appropriate for a 4-year-old to be told to push someone to defend herself.\n\nI need to consider child development. At 4 years old, kids are still learning social boundaries and how to handle conflicts. The parent is trying to teach their daughter to protect herself, which is a valid concern. However, teaching a child to use physical force, even if it's to push someone, might not be the best approach. It could set a precedent where the child learns that physical action is an acceptable response to any uncomfortable situation, even if it's not violent. Also, there's a risk that the other child might react negatively, as the daughter feared, leading to more conflict or even injury.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent is right in acknowledging that the other child is being too aggressive and not respecting boundaries. The teachers aren't effectively addressing the issue, so the parent is trying to equip their daughter with a way to handle it until the daycare can manage it properly. But at that age, maybe the child isn't ready to make that judgment call on her own. It's a balance between teaching self-defensive behavior and ensuring the child doesn't resort to violence without understanding the context.\n\nAnother angle: The parent's advice could be seen as encouraging a form of self-defense, but the other parent's concern is valid because using physical force can escalate situations. The daycare's role is to manage such interactions, so maybe the parent should focus on working with the daycare to find a solution rather than teaching the child to handle it herself. However, if the daycare isn't effective, the parent needs to ensure their child's safety.\n\nAlso, the daughter's age is a factor. A 4-year-old might not fully understand the nuances of when it's okay to push someone versus when it's not. The parent's instruction to push back if the other kid reacts could lead to a cycle of aggression that the child can't control. It's possible the parent is trying to teach assertiveness, but the method might be too aggressive for a young child.\n\nIn conclusion, while the parent's intention is to protect their daughter, the method of encouraging physical resistance might not be the best approach for a child that age. The spouse's concern about avoiding violence and relying on adult intervention is also valid. The parent might not be entirely in the wrong because they're addressing a real problem, but their approach might be misguided. So, the answer could be that the parent is in the wrong, or maybe not. But I think the parent is in the wrong because promoting physical force for a 4-year-old in such situations could lead to more issues. The correct approach is to teach the child to express discomfort and seek adult help, not to use physical force. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
