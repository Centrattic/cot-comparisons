Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a parent advising their 4-year-old daughter to push away another kid who's giving her uncomfortable hugs and kisses. The parent is encouraging the child to use force if the other kid won't stop, even suggesting pushing back or running to an adult if the other child retaliates.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's intent. They want to protect their daughter from uncomfortable or potentially harmful situations. The other child is described as being aggressive and not stopping even when told by teachers. The parent might feel that the teachers aren't handling it effectively, so they're teaching their daughter to defend herself. That makes sense from a protective standpoint.\n\nBut then there's the spouse's concern. They think it's better to rely on adults and not teach the child to use violence. The parent argues that it's about using \"legit force\" in a situation where the other child is being violent. The parent also mentions that they usually raise the child to avoid violence, so this is a specific case where they see it as necessary.\n\nNow, the question is whether encouraging a 4-year-old to push another child is appropriate. At that age, children don't have the emotional maturity to handle conflict in nuanced ways. Even if it's a case of self-defense, teaching a child to use physical force could lead to more aggression or misunderstandings. Also, the parent is setting a precedent where physical action is acceptable in certain situations, which might be confusing for a young child.\n\nAnother angle is the legal and educational perspective. Schools and childcare centers often have policies against children initiating physical contact, even in self-defense. If the child acts on the parent's advice, it might lead to disciplinary actions from the daycare or legal concerns if the other child's parents take it as a problem. Also, the daycare might not have been clear enough on how to handle the situation, but the parent's solution bypasses the system entirely.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent is trying to empower the child to recognize and resist unwanted physical contact, which is important for safety. However, the method of teaching physical resistance might not be the best approach. There are alternative ways to teach a child to set boundaries, like using words more effectively, seeking immediate adult help, or practicing assertiveness without physical confrontation.\n\nI should also consider the child's age. At 4 years old, the child might not fully understand the difference between defensive pushing and aggressive behavior. The parent's advice could be misinterpreted or overused in other situations. The child's response about fearing retaliation shows that she's aware of the potential consequences, and the parent's suggestion to push back might escalate the conflict.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, many parenting experts advise against teaching young children to use violence as a solution, even in defense. It's generally recommended to teach non-violent conflict resolution and to involve adults when problems arise. So the parent's approach might go against established child-rearing advice.\n\nSo weighing these factors: the parent's intention is good, but the method might be inappropriate for the child's age and the context. The spouse's concern about encouraging violence is valid, especially since the child is very young and might not handle it correctly. The daycare's role is also important here; maybe there's a need to revisit how the issue is being managed there instead of teaching the child to handle it physically.\n\nTherefore, while the parent's desire to protect their child is understandable, the approach of encouraging physical resistance might be in the wrong. The parent could explore other ways to address the issue with the daycare and ensure the child knows how to report the behavior effectively without resorting to violence.\n"
