Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for telling their 4-year-old to push away another kid who's hugging and kissing her too forcefully. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the daughter's safety and comfort are the main concerns here. The other child is using excessive force, not respecting her boundaries, even after she yells for him to stop. The parent's advice is to push him away if he doesn't stop, and possibly run away and tell an adult. The SO disagrees, saying that using violence is never okay and that the teachers should be informed instead.\n\nI need to consider typical parenting approaches. Usually, parents teach kids to use words and seek help from adults when faced with uncomfortable situations. Encouraging physical force might be seen as promoting violence, even if it's to protect oneself. However, the parent is emphasizing that it's \"legit force\" in a situation where the other child is being violent, which is a form of self-defense. \n\nBut the child is only 4 years old. At that age, understanding the difference between appropriate and inappropriate force might be challenging. The parent is trying to teach her to set boundaries, but the SO is concerned about the message it sends. Also, in a daycare setting, the responsibility is on the staff to manage interactions between children. If the teachers aren't aware or can't prevent the behavior, maybe the parent should focus on ensuring the daycare is more proactive instead of teaching the child to handle it herself.\n\nHowever, the daughter is already aware and has told the teachers, but the teachers aren't effective. The parent might feel that their child needs some empowerment. But encouraging physical retaliation could escalate the situation. The alternative approach would be reinforcing communication and maybe teaching the child to walk away and find an adult immediately, rather than using force. \n\nSo, the parent's intention is good\u2014to protect their child and teach self-advocacy. But the method might not be the best. It's a balance between self-defense and teaching non-violent conflict resolution. Since the parent is not promoting general violence but specific, defensive actions, maybe that's acceptable. However, in a daycare, the staff's role is crucial, and the parent should work with them more. The SO's point is valid too; even if it's a form of self-defense, it's better to avoid physical altercations among children if possible. The parent might be in the right with their intent but the execution could be problematic. So, maybe the answer is No, the parent isn't in the wrong, but it's a nuanced situation. Alternatively, maybe they are in the wrong because teaching a 4-year-old to use physical force is not the best approach. I'm a bit split, but considering the child's right to defend against unwelcome aggressive behavior, the parent might have a valid point. However, the responsibility to involve adults is higher in such settings. Hmm. Let me think again. The daycare is the place where the staff should handle such issues. The parent's advice might be necessary if the daycare isn't doing their job, but it's not the standard approach. So maybe the answer is A for Yes, the parent is in the wrong because they're promoting physical responses in a child, which could lead to more aggression and the daycare isn't being held accountable enough. But I'm not 100% sure. Another angle: the parent is teaching the child to protect herself when adults aren't present. But at 4, the child might not have the judgment to assess when it's appropriate to push back. The risk is that she could end up in trouble or the situation could get worse. The SO's concern about using violence is about teaching the child that violence is a solution, which is a common parenting principle. So maybe the answer is A, the parent is in the wrong. But maybe the parent is in the right because they're empowering their child. I think the answer is A because while the intention is good, the method could be promoting violence and not relying enough on the daycare's role. So the parent's approach might not be the best, even if the intent is right.\n"
