Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the parent is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a 4-year-old girl who's being hugged and kissed very forcefully by another kid at daycare. The parent advised their daughter to push the child away if the hugs are uncomfortable and the other kid doesn't stop. The spouse is upset, thinking the parent is encouraging violence. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the children. At 4 years old, kids are still learning social boundaries and how to express discomfort. The parent is teaching their daughter to use physical force to stop unwanted contact. But is that appropriate?\n\nThe other kid isn't violent in general, just in his greetings. The parent argues it's \"legit force\" because the other child is being violent. But from a child's perspective, what's the difference between a strong hug and forced contact? Maybe the parent is trying to empower the girl to set boundaries, but using physical pushback could escalate the situation. \n\nAlso, the daycare teachers aren't handling it effectively. The parent might be frustrated because the daycare isn't protecting their child. However, advising a 4-year-old to push back could teach her that violence is acceptable in certain contexts. That might lead to her using force inappropriately later. \n\nOn the other hand, the child is being taught to assert herself, which is a good skill. But the method here is physical. The parent is trying to teach self-defense, but maybe there are other ways, like using words or seeking help immediately. The parent does mention telling the child to run and tell an adult, which is good. \n\nThe spouse's concern is about encouraging any form of violence. The parent clarifies they aren't promoting general violence, but specific situations where the other child is being violent. However, the line between defending oneself and starting a fight might be blurry for a 4-year-old. \n\nIn terms of child development, experts usually recommend teaching kids to use their words and seek help first. Physical intervention is generally a last resort and should be taught carefully. Since the daycare isn't addressing the issue, the parent might feel they have to step in, but giving a young child the go-ahead to push another might not be the best approach. \n\nSo, considering all that, the parent might be in the wrong because they're teaching a young child to use physical force as a primary response, which could lead to more aggression. Even if the intent is good, the method might not be the best. The spouse is right to be concerned about promoting violence, even in self-defense scenarios for a 4-year-old. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
