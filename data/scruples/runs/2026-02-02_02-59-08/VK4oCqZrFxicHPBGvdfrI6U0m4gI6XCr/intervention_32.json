Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the parent is at fault for advising their 4-year-old to push away another child who's hugging and kissing her too forcefully.\n\nFirst, the context: The other child is being aggressive, not respecting the daughter's boundaries, and even after being told by teachers, he continues. The parent encourages their daughter to use \"legit force\" to stop the unwanted affection. The spouse disagrees, thinking it's better to report it to teachers and avoid any violence.\n\nSo, the parent's reasoning is that since the other child is using force (hugging/kissing too hard and not stopping), the daughter has the right to defend herself. The parent emphasizes that it's about using appropriate force, not escalating into a fight. The daughter is old enough to understand the difference, they argue.\n\nPossible angles to consider: \n\n1. **Child's Understanding of Force**: At 4 years old, a child may not fully grasp the nuances of \"legit force\" versus aggression. The parent's advice might be too advanced for her age. Even if the parent intended it as a one-time push to stop the hug, the child might interpret it as permission to use violence, which could escalate the situation or lead to her getting into trouble.\n\n2. **Alternative Solutions**: The parent acknowledges that the daughter has already reported the issue to teachers, but the behavior continues. The spouse's point is valid\u2014relying on adults to intervene is usually the safer approach. Introducing physical resistance might be seen as promoting violence, which is generally discouraged in young children, even if the parent's intent is to protect.\n\n3. **Safety and Escalation**: The daughter is concerned the other child might push back. The parent advised pushing back or running away. However, a 4-year-old might not have the judgment to assess when to use force or when to flee. There's a risk that this advice could lead to a physical confrontation, which could harm both kids or make the other child more aggressive.\n\n4. **Social and Emotional Learning**: Teaching a child to use physical means to resolve conflict might not be the best approach. Modeling non-violent conflict resolution is usually encouraged. Even if the situation is uncomfortable, guiding the child to express her discomfort and seek help from adults (teachers) is more about social skills development.\n\n5. **Cultural and Parenting Philosophies**: Different parents have different approaches. Some prioritize empowering children to set boundaries, others stress non-violence. However, in most cases, experts recommend that children should not use physical force unless absolutely necessary and under adult supervision. Since the child is in daycare, the adults there should handle the situation.\n\nIn conclusion, while the parent's intention is to protect their daughter, the advice to use physical force might be inappropriate for her age. The situation is ongoing, and the daycare setting requires that adults handle such issues. The parent's approach could be seen as encouraging conflict rather than seeking resolution through communication and adult intervention. So, the parent might be in the wrong.\n"
