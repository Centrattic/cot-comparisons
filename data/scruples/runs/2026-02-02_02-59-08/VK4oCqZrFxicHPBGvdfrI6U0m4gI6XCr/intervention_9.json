Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for teaching their 4-year-old daughter to push away another kid who's hugging her too forcefully. The situation involves a child who's being physically uncomfortable with another child's behavior, and the parents are divided on how to handle it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The daughter is 4 years old, and the other child is also 4. The other kid is hugging her too hard, kissing her without her consent, and not stopping even when she yells. The author told their daughter it's okay to push back if she's being hurt. The spouse disagrees, saying they should rely on teachers instead of using any form of violence.\n\nNow, I need to think about the appropriateness of the author's advice. At 4 years old, kids are still learning social boundaries and how to handle conflicts. The situation described is about a child who's experiencing unwanted physical contact, which could be a form of early bullying or inappropriate behavior. The author is teaching their daughter to defend herself physically in that moment, which might be seen as justified if the other child is truly aggressive and not respecting boundaries. But is it appropriate for a 4-year-old to be taught to use physical force?\n\nOn the one hand, the author is trying to protect their daughter by empowering her to take immediate action when adults aren't around or aren't effective. Teaching a child to set boundaries and protect themselves can be important. However, for a 4-year-old, the ability to discern between appropriate force and violence might be limited. The author mentions they are strict about not using violence, but this is a case of \"legit force.\" But the line between the two can be blurry for a young child.\n\nOn the other hand, the spouse's argument is that relying on teachers is better. The teachers might not see the interactions, though, as the author mentions. If the teachers aren't intervening effectively, maybe the child needs another strategy. However, encouraging a child to use physical force could lead to more conflict or escalate the situation. Also, at that age, the child might not have the emotional maturity to handle pushing back without causing more harm, either physically or socially.\n\nAnother angle is the legal and educational perspective. Schools and daycare centers usually have policies against physical altercations between children, even if one child is acting inappropriately. Teaching a child to use force might go against those policies and could result in disciplinary actions against the author's daughter. The spouse might be concerned about the daughter getting into trouble or the child developing aggressive tendencies.\n\nAlso, the child's response was worried about the other kid pushing back or beating her. The author told her to push back again or run and tell an adult. The author's advice includes using force and then seeking help, which might be a balanced approach, but the effectiveness depends on the child's ability to carry it out. However, a 4-year-old might not understand the nuances of when to use force versus when to seek help, potentially leading to misuse.\n\nIn terms of the broader context, the parent is trying to protect their child from unwanted physical contact, which is a valid concern. However, the method of teaching physical resistance might not be the best approach for a child of that age. There might be alternative strategies, like teaching the child to clearly say \"no\" or use a firm voice to stop the contact, or practicing how to tell an adult more effectively. Those methods could be less likely to escalate the situation and more in line with non-violent conflict resolution.\n\nAlso, considering the developmental stage, a 4-year-old's understanding of consent and personal space is still forming. The parent's approach might be trying to accelerate that understanding, but using physical force might not be the most age-appropriate method. It could also send mixed messages about conflict resolution, where the parent teaches non-violence in most contexts but allows for it in specific cases, which the child might not fully grasp.\n\nIn conclusion, while the intention to protect the child is noble, the method of teaching physical resistance to a 4-year-old might not be the best approach. The spouse's concern about relying on teachers and non-violent solutions is valid, especially considering the child's age and the potential for misinterpretation of the advice. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for encouraging physical force in this situation, as there might be more appropriate and developmentally suitable strategies available.\n"
