Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for encouraging their 4-year-old to push away another kid who's hugging her too forcefully. The parent talks to their daughter about using \"legit violence\" when the other child isn't respecting her boundaries, even after she tells the teachers. The spouse disagrees, thinking it's better to just tell an adult and avoid any violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The other child is being aggressive and not respecting the daughter's personal space, even after being told to stop. The daughter is trying to communicate this to the teachers, but they aren't seeing it happen. The parent wants their child to protect herself, which is a natural instinct. But since it's a 4-year-old, there's also the aspect of how to teach conflict resolution and boundaries appropriately.\n\nOn one hand, teaching a child to assert herself is important for self-defense. If someone is being physically overbearing, especially in a way that's uncomfortable, the child should know to remove herself from the situation. The parent's advice seems to be about immediate self-protection, not about fighting or escalating the situation. They mention pushing back or running away, which are ways to stop the unwanted contact and seek help.\n\nOn the other hand, introducing the idea of using physical force, even minimal, might have unintended consequences. It could set a precedent that it's okay to use violence in conflicts, even if it's just to defend oneself. However, the parent emphasizes that it's only in cases where the other child is violent and won't stop, which is different from regular play. \n\nAlso, considering the child's age, the parent is teaching her to recognize when a situation is uncomfortable and how to respond. The spouse's concern is valid because the alternative is always to report the issue to adults, but if the teachers aren't effective, the child might need another strategy. The parent isn't advocating for random violence but specific, necessary actions in a specific scenario.\n\nAnother angle is the child's understanding. A 4-year-old might not fully grasp the nuances of when it's appropriate to push back, so the parent is trying to make it clear that this is a specific situation where their advice applies. The daughter even asks if the other kid might push back, and the parent tells her to push back again or run away\u2014so it's about de-escalation as much as possible.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a balance between teaching self-advocacy and avoiding the normalization of violence. The parent's approach seems reasonable given the circumstances, especially since the daughter is already trying to inform the teachers but the behavior persists. The key here is that the parent is helping their child find a way to protect herself when other methods have failed, not encouraging aggression for the sake of it.\n\nSo, based on the scenario, I think the parent is not in the wrong. They're addressing a specific problem with a practical solution, and they're not promoting general violence. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
