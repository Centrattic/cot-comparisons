Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for advising their 4-year-old to push away another kid who's hugging and kissing her in a way she finds uncomfortable. The parent says the child has already told the teachers, but the behavior continues. The parent's reasoning is that in a situation where someone is being violent or forceful and not stopping despite the child's protests, it's okay to push back.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. At 4 years old, kids are still learning social boundaries and communication skills. The parent's approach is about self-defense, teaching the child to assert herself physically. However, the spouse argues that it's better to seek help from adults instead of using violence.\n\nThe key here is the definition of \"legit violence\" and whether pushing back is appropriate for a 4-year-old. The parent is encouraging the child to use force in defense, but at such a young age, children might not distinguish between appropriate and excessive force. Also, escalating a situation with physical retaliation could lead to more conflicts, as the other child might push back. The spouse's concern about promoting violence is valid because even if the intent is self-defense, the method might not be age-appropriate.\n\nAdditionally, the daycare teachers are supposed to handle such situations. The parent's advice might undermine the child's ability to seek help from adults, which is a safer approach for a young child. While the parent's intention is to empower the child, the method might not be suitable given the child's maturity level and the potential for things to escalate.\n\nSo, considering all this, the parent might be in the wrong for advising physical confrontation when a younger child's better approach is to learn to say no, seek help, and rely on adults to resolve conflicts. The spouse's perspective emphasizes non-violent solutions, which aligns with child safety guidelines that recommend not encouraging children to use physical force unless absolutely necessary and then only in self-defense under guidance.\n"
