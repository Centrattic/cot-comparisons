Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the parent (the author) is in the wrong for advising their 4-year-old daughter to push away another child who's hugging and kissing her too forcefully.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The other child's hugs are described as \"violently\" hugging, not stopping even when the daughter yells. The parent told the daughter it's okay to push back if the other kid doesn't stop, and also mentioned pushing back or running away if the other child retaliates. The spouse disagrees, saying it's better to tell a teacher and avoid violence.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the child is being subjected to unwanted physical contact that's persistent despite telling the other kid to stop. The parent's advice is about using force to stop the immediate harm. The spouse thinks the child should rely solely on adults to intervene.\n\nNow, considering the age of the children, 4 years old. At that age, children might not have the emotional maturity to handle such situations calmly. The parent is trying to empower the child to protect herself. But there's a risk that teaching a child to use physical force could escalate the situation or lead to more aggression. However, the parent is emphasizing \"legit violence\" as self-defense when the other child is being violent.\n\nI also need to consider child development and parenting strategies. Generally, it's taught that children should learn to communicate their discomfort and seek help from adults. But in cases where the behavior is persistent and harmful, allowing the child to defend themselves might be necessary for their safety and self-esteem.\n\nThe parent didn't encourage random violence; it's specifically in response to unwanted and forceful contact. The advice includes options like pushing away, pushing back if necessary, and running to an adult. The parent also mentioned the child is old enough to understand the difference, which might be a valid point. However, the spouse is concerned about teaching violence, which is a valid concern as well.\n\nI should also think about the daycare's role. The teachers aren't seeing it and the other child isn't stopping when told. So maybe the parent's intervention is necessary because the system isn't working. But maybe there's a middle ground, like reinforcing communication strategies more, or working with the daycare to address the issue more effectively.\n\nIn terms of ethics and parenting, there's a balance between teaching non-violence and ensuring the child's safety. The parent's actions are to protect their child from ongoing discomfort and potential harm. The spouse's concern is about not teaching violence, which is important for social development. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the parent's approach is proportionate. The parent isn't teaching general aggression but self-defense in a specific scenario where the child is being forced. Since the other child isn't respecting the daughter's boundaries, the parent's advice is about asserting those boundaries physically when communication fails. However, for a 4-year-old, the expectation of using physical force might be too much, and there might be better strategies. But given that the daycare isn't handling it, the parent's approach could be seen as reasonable.\n\nSo, is the parent in the wrong? It's a tough call. On one hand, they're trying to protect their child. On the other, teaching a child to use violence even in self-defense could be problematic. However, since the situation involves persistent unwanted behavior, the parent might not be in the wrong. The answer would be B (No), but there are nuances.\n"
