Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The parent is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their 4-year-old daughter it's okay to push away another kid who's hugging and kissing her too forcefully. The husband argues against using violence, while the parent believes it's a legitimate use of force in self-defense.\n\nFirst, the situation involves a child who's being physically overwhelmed by another child's affection, which isn't appropriate. The daughter has already tried telling the teachers, but the behavior continues. The parent's advice is to push back if the other kid doesn't stop, which is a form of self-defense. However, since both are young kids, there's a concern about escalating the situation. \n\nThe key points to consider: the child's safety and comfort, the appropriateness of violence even in self-defense at a young age, and alternative solutions. The parent's intention is to protect their daughter from unwanted physical contact, which is understandable. However, teaching a 4-year-old to use physical force might not be the best approach. At that age, children might not fully grasp the consequences of their actions, and pushing could lead to more aggression. The husband's perspective about involving adults is also valid because daycare staff are responsible for enforcing boundaries and addressing such issues.\n\nBut on the other hand, the daughter is already being physically forced, and the teachers aren't intervening effectively. The parent is trying to empower their child to protect herself when adults aren't present. The line between teaching self-protection and encouraging violence is thin here. \n\nI think the parent's advice is well-intentioned but might be too direct for a 4-year-old. There's a risk that the child could misinterpret the advice, leading to more conflict. The husband's concern about avoiding violence is also important, especially in a daycare setting where staff should manage such situations. However, the parent isn't advocating for uncontrolled violence but rather a specific response to prevent harm. \n\nSo, the parent might not be entirely in the wrong, but there's room for a better approach. Maybe combining both perspectives: teaching the child to assertively say no, use words, and seek help from adults if the behavior continues. That way, the child learns boundary-setting without resorting to physical force. Therefore, the parent might be partially in the wrong for suggesting physical action, but their concern is valid.\n"
