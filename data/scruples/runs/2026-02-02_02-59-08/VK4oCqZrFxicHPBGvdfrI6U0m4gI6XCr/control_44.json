Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the parent who encouraged their 4-year-old to push away another kid is in the wrong. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the daughter is in daycare with a boy who hugs and kisses her forcefully, and she's uncomfortable. The parent advised her to push him away if he's being violent. The spouse thinks teaching violence is wrong, but the parent argues it's about legitimate self-defense.\n\nHmm. At 4 years old, teaching a child to push back might be seen as promoting aggressive behavior. Kids that age don't typically understand the difference between self-defense and aggression. They might just see it as fighting. Also, daycare staff are supposed to manage such interactions, so maybe the parent should rely more on the teachers to intervene.\n\nBut then, the parent's concern is valid. The daughter is being forced into physical contact she doesn't want. If the daycare isn't handling it, the parent might feel they have no choice. However, teaching a child to use force could have unintended consequences, like the other child reacting negatively or the daughter becoming more aggressive.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent is trying to protect their child's autonomy and safety. It's a tough balance between teaching non-violence and ensuring the child can say no. Maybe there's a middle ground, like teaching the child to clearly communicate \"no\" and to seek help from adults, rather than physical resistance.\n\nThe spouse's point about telling the teachers is valid, but if the teachers aren't effective, then the parent's solution might be a reaction to that failure. Still, encouraging physical pushback could escalate the situation. The daycare's role is crucial here, and the parent might not be in the wrong if the daycare isn't doing their job. But the approach of using violence might be inappropriate for a 4-year-old.\n\nSo, considering all this, maybe the parent isn't entirely wrong. They're trying to protect their child. But teaching a young child to use force might not be the best approach. There's a chance the answer is A (they are in the wrong) because promoting physical confrontation at that age is risky. However, the alternative of not teaching self-defense could leave the child vulnerable. It's a tricky situation. I think the answer leans towards A because the parent is encouraging violent behavior which isn't age-appropriate and could lead to more conflict. The daycare should handle it, and the parent should focus on reinforcing communication and seeking adult help instead.\n"
