Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the parent is in the wrong here. The situation is that their 4-year-old daughter is being hugged and kissed too forcefully by another child at daycare. The daughter has already told the teachers, but the other kid doesn't stop, and the teachers don't see it happening often. The parent told the daughter it's okay to push the other kid away if he's being too rough, and even to push back or run away if the kid retaliates. The parent's spouse thinks that's wrong and that the daughter should just tell the teachers and not use violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. At 4 years old, kids are still learning social boundaries and how to handle conflicts. The other child's behavior is persistent and seems to be unwanted by the daughter. The parent is trying to teach their child self-defense in a situation where the child is being physically uncomfortable. But the spouse is worried about promoting violence.\n\nThe key points here are whether the parent's advice is appropriate. The parent isn't encouraging random violence but rather teaching the child to protect herself when someone is being aggressive and not respecting her boundaries. The parent also mentions that they are strict about not using violence otherwise, so it's a specific response to a specific situation.\n\nHowever, teaching a 4-year-old to push someone back might escalate the situation. Kids her age might not have the judgment to assess when force is appropriate, and pushing back could lead to more aggression. The daycare's role is to manage these interactions, and maybe involving the teachers more effectively could be a better solution. But the teachers already know, and it's not working.\n\nAnother angle is consent and bodily autonomy. The daughter is being forced into physical contact she doesn't want. Teaching her to assert her boundaries physically might be necessary if verbal or reporting isn't enough. But some might argue that even at that age, children should be taught to report and not retaliate.\n\nI think it's a balance. The parent is trying to empower the daughter in a situation where she's being harassed, but the spouse is concerned about violence. The parent isn't teaching the child to be violent generally but to defend herself. Since the other child isn't stopping despite being told, and the teachers aren't effective, the parent's advice might be a reasonable response to protect the child. However, maybe there's a better way, like more active involvement from the daycare or parents of the other child. But given the scenario, the parent's actions seem to be in the child's best interest to prevent harm. So I'm leaning towards the parent not being in the wrong, but maybe there's more to consider.\n"
