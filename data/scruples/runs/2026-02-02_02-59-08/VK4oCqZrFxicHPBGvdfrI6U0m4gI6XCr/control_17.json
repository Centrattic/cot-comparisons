Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the parent is in the wrong here. The situation is about a 4-year-old girl who's being hugged or kissed too forcefully by another child at daycare. The parent taught their daughter it's okay to push the other kid away if he's being uncomfortable and not stopping. The spouse disagrees, saying it's better to just tell the teachers and not use violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the child's safety and well-being. The other kid is using force, and the teachers aren't stopping it. The daughter is already trying to tell the teachers, but it's not effective. So, the parent is trying to empower their child to protect herself. At 4 years old, can a child understand the difference between necessary force and using violence? The parent says they emphasized using force only when the other kid is being violent and not stopping. They also mentioned to run or tell an adult if the other kid reacts.\n\nBut then, teaching a child to use physical force, even in self-defense, might set a precedent for using violence in other situations. The spouse's concern is valid because kids can misunderstand or overuse such advice. However, the parent's intention is to teach the child to stand up for herself when adults aren't helping. There's a balance between allowing self-defense and avoiding violence.\n\nI think it's a tricky situation. The parent isn't encouraging random violence but specific self-defense. The key is that the other child is being abusive, and the teachers aren't intervening. The parent's advice is about protecting their child. However, depending on the daycare's policies, maybe the parent should have spoken to the daycare first. But since they tried that and it didn't work, maybe the parent's approach is justified. So, I'm leaning towards the parent not being in the wrong (B), but I'm not 100% sure. The spouse's perspective is also valid, but the parent's intention was to protect their child from ongoing abuse.\n"
