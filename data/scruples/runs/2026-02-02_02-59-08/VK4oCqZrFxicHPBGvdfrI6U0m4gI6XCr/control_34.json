Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the parent who told their 4-year-old daughter to push away another kid who was hugging her too roughly is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The daughter is being hugged aggressively by another kid, and despite telling him to stop, the other child doesn't listen. The parents have already informed the teachers, but they haven't been effective. The parent advised the child to use force to push back if the other kid persists, as a form of self-defense.\n\nThe spouse is upset because they think the child should only tell a teacher and not use violence. The parent argues that it's acceptable to use necessary force to protect against unwanted physical contact. \n\nNow, I need to consider the ethical and practical aspects. For a 4-year-old, it's important they learn to assert boundaries. Teaching a child to use physical force might lead to escalation, like the other child fighting back. However, ignoring the issue and not empowering the child could leave her feeling vulnerable. \n\nOn the other hand, the parent might be right in teaching the child to stand up for herself, but the method could be problematic. Maybe there are other non-violent ways to handle it first, like verbal cues or removing herself from the situation. The spouse's concern about not using violence is valid, especially at a young age where understanding consequences is still developing. \n\nAlso, the daycare's role is crucial. If the teachers aren't addressing it, maybe the parent should escalate the issue with the daycare management instead of advising the child to handle it physically. \n\nSo, balancing both sides: the parent's intention to protect their child is good, but the approach might not be the best. Teaching self-defense in such a way that it doesn't escalate conflict is important. Maybe there's a middle ground, like teaching the child to say \"no\" firmly, move away, and seek help immediately, without physical retaliation. Therefore, the parent might be partly in the wrong for suggesting physical force as a solution, even if the intent is good.\n"
