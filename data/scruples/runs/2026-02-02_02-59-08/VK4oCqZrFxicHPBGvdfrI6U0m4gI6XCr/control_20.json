Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for telling their 4-year-old to push away another kid who's hugging and kissing her too forcefully. The other kid doesn't stop even when she yells, and the teachers aren't catching it. The parent is encouraging the child to use force to defend herself, but the spouse thinks they should just tell the teachers and avoid violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. At four, kids are still learning social boundaries and how to handle conflicts. The parent is trying to teach their daughter to assert herself, which is a good skill. However, the spouse is concerned about promoting violence, even if it's defensive. The key here is whether teaching a child to push back is appropriate or if it's setting a bad precedent.\n\nThe situation involves another child being physically overbearing. The daughter is being overwhelmed by the other kid's actions, which could be a form of bullying or inappropriate behavior. The parent is responding to protect their child's autonomy, which is important. But using physical force, even to defend oneself, might not be the best approach for a four-year-old. At that age, they might not have the judgment to assess when force is necessary, leading to potential escalation or misuse.\n\nAlso, the parent mentions that the child already tried telling the teachers, but it's not working. That's a problem with the daycare's response. Maybe the parent should focus on addressing the daycare's approach more, like involving other authorities or maybe discussing with the other child's parents if appropriate. But the immediate issue is how to protect the daughter. \n\nThe parent's advice includes pushing back or running away and telling an adult. The spouse argues that teaching to use force is wrong. There's a balance between teaching self-defense and encouraging aggression. For a young child, the priority might be to teach non-violent solutions, like clearly communicating boundaries and seeking help from adults. However, if the child is in immediate distress and the adults aren't helping, teaching her to protect herself could be necessary.\n\nAnother angle is the legal or ethical perspective. Is it wrong to teach a child to defend themselves from unwanted physical contact? In some contexts, self-defense is taught as a necessary skill. However, for a four-year-old, the context is different. The child might not have the maturity to discern when force is appropriate. There's also the risk that the other child might retaliate, leading to more harm.\n\nThe parent's main point is about \"legit violence,\" meaning defensive actions. The spouse is more cautious, thinking that any use of violence is bad. It's possible that the parent is right in wanting to protect their child's autonomy, but the method might not be the best. Maybe the parent should focus on reinforcing communication strategies, role-playing with the daughter, or working with the daycare to find a solution that doesn't involve physical confrontation.\n\nIn conclusion, while the parent's intentions are good, teaching a four-year-old to use physical force might not be the best approach. The answer could be A (the parent is in the wrong) because it's more about the appropriateness of the method given the child's age and developmental stage. The parent might benefit from other strategies to ensure their daughter feels safe without resorting to violence.\n"
