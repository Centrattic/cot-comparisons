Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the parent is wrong for telling their 4-year-old to push away another kid who's hugging her too hard. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe daughter is in daycare. There's another kid, same age, who hugs her too forcefully and kisses her, even when she yells to stop. The daughter told the teachers, but it's not stopping. The parent told the daughter it's okay to push him away if he's hurting her, and even to push back or run away if the other kid retaliates.\n\nThe spouse is upset, thinking teaching violence is wrong. The parent argues that it's legitimate force in a violent situation, and that the child is old enough to understand the difference.\n\nSo, the question is whether the parent is in the wrong here. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the other kid's behavior: forceful hugging and kissing without consent, not stopping when told. That's a problem. The daughter is a young child who might not know how to handle this on her own. The teachers aren't effective because they don't see it happening, and the other kid's parents are overbearing.\n\nThe parent's advice is to use force when necessary. At 4 years old, is teaching a child to push back appropriate? On one hand, teaching self-defense to prevent harm could be seen as protective. On the other hand, using physical force as a first response might model aggressive behavior and could lead to escalation. Also, 4-year-olds might not have the judgment to assess when force is appropriate.\n\nThe parent emphasizes that it's only in situations where the other kid is being violent. But even then, teaching a child to respond with violence could have unintended consequences. The alternative approach of always telling an adult might not work here since the teachers aren't catching it.\n\nAnother angle: the daycare's responsibility. Maybe the parent should focus on working with the daycare to address the behavior, perhaps through more structured supervision or communication with the other parents. But the daughter already tried that without success.\n\nThe parent's reasoning is about consent and self-protection. The child needs to assert boundaries. However, the method of teaching that through physical pushback might not be the best approach. Maybe alternative strategies like verbal assertiveness or a non-violent way to remove themselves could be considered first.\n\nIn terms of child development, 4-year-olds are learning social skills but might not handle conflict resolution effectively. Teaching them to use physical force could lead to more aggression. But the parent's intent is protective, trying to prevent their child from being a victim of unwanted physical contact.\n\nThe spouse is concerned about normalizing violence. The parent is trying to balance protection with appropriate behavior. It's a tough situation where neither approach is perfect.\n\nI think the parent's intention is good, but the method might be problematic. Encouraging a child to use physical force could lead to more issues, even if it's for self-defense. There might be better ways to address the problem, like working with daycare staff more effectively or teaching the child to clearly say \"no\" and seek help immediately. So, maybe the parent is in the wrong for suggesting violence as a solution, even if the circumstances are concerning.\n"
