Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The parent is asking if they're in the wrong for advising their 4-year-old to push away another kid who's forceful in hugging and kissing her. The parent argues it's about self-defense when the other child isn't stopping despite the daughter's protests. The spouse thinks they should rely on teachers instead of using violence.\n\nFirst, considering the child's age: 4 years old. At that age, kids might not fully understand or handle physical confrontation. Even if the parent is teaching self-defense, a 4-year-old might escalate things unintentionally. Also, in daycare settings, teachers are supposed to manage interactions. The parent's solution might bypass the daycare's role in handling such situations.\n\nThe parent did mention that the daughter already reported this, but the teachers didn't act effectively. So maybe the parent felt they had to step in. However, teaching a young child to use physical force could have unintended consequences. The daughter's fear of retaliation is a valid point. Pushing back might lead to more conflict, and the parent's advice might not account for the child's ability to differentiate between appropriate and excessive force.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent's concern about their child's safety is valid. If the other child is indeed being aggressive and not respecting boundaries, teaching self-advocacy is important. The parent isn't encouraging violence for fun but setting boundaries. However, the method of pushing might not be the best approach for a 4-year-old. Maybe alternative strategies like verbal assertion or seeking help could be better.\n\nThe parent's advice to push back and then tell an adult is a mix of self-defense and seeking help. But the key issue is whether physical intervention is appropriate for such a young child. There's a risk that the child might overreact or misuse the advice. Daycare policies might also have guidelines against physical contact between children, so the parent's approach might conflict with that.\n\nIn conclusion, while the parent's intent is to protect their child, the method might not be suitable for a 4-year-old. The spouse's point about relying on teachers and avoiding violence makes sense, especially in a controlled environment like daycare where adults are supposed to manage interactions. The parent should consider other non-violent strategies, like reinforcing the child's ability to say \"no\" and ensuring the daycare is more proactive in addressing the issue. So, the parent might be in the wrong for advising physical action instead of focusing on communication and adult intervention.\n"
