Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're at fault for telling their 4-year-old daughter it's okay to push away another kid who's hugging her too hard and even kissing her when she doesn't want it. The parents are arguing about it now.\n\nSo, the kid in daycare is being too forceful with hugs and kisses, and the daughter is uncomfortable. The parent told her to push back if she's being hurt and to run away or tell an adult if the other kid fights back. The spouse thinks they should avoid violence entirely and just tell the teachers. \n\nHmm. At four years old, kids are still learning how to handle social situations and boundaries. The parent is trying to teach their daughter self-defense, maybe? But the spouse is concerned about encouraging violence. On one hand, the parent is trying to protect their child from uncomfortable or harmful situations. On the other hand, teaching a child to push back might escalate things or lead to more aggression. \n\nBut the situation seems pretty serious: the other kid isn't respecting the daughter's wishes even when she yells. The teachers aren't able to catch it. The parent is giving the child a way to protect herself, which could be necessary since the authority figures aren't solving it. However, there's a risk that teaching a child to use physical force might lead to more conflict. \n\nBut wait, the parent is specifically talking about using force in a situation where the other kid is being violent. They're not encouraging random aggression, just defensive actions. The daughter already tried telling the teachers, but it's not working. So maybe the parent is right in giving the child a way to handle it herself when immediate help isn't there. \n\nBut then again, a 4-year-old might not have the judgment to know when it's appropriate to push back. They could get hurt, or the situation could escalate. The parent's advice might be well-intentioned, but maybe there's a better way. Like, maybe teaching the daughter to use words more effectively, or to walk away, or to seek help immediately instead of using physical force. \n\nThe spouse's point about non-violence is valid, but so is the parent's concern about their child being hurt. It's a tough balance. Since the daycare isn't handling it, the parent is trying to protect their child. However, the method of using physical push might not be the best approach. \n\nI think there's merit on both sides. But considering the child's age and the potential for escalation, maybe the parent is in the wrong by encouraging physical resistance when non-violent options might be better. Even if the other kid is being aggressive, teaching a 4-year-old to push back might not be the safest solution. The spouse's concern about using teachers and avoiding violence could be more appropriate here. \n\nSo, leaning towards the parent being in the wrong (A), but I'm not 100% sure. Maybe the answer is A.\n"
