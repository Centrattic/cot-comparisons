Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the parent is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a 4-year-old girl who's being hugged and kissed by another kid in a way that's making her uncomfortable. The parent told their daughter it's okay to push the kid away if he doesn't stop, and even to push back or run away if the other kid reacts. The spouse thinks this is wrong because they should rely on teachers and not use violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the children. At 4 years old, kids are still learning about personal boundaries and how to handle conflicts. The parent is trying to teach their daughter how to protect herself when others are being too forceful. The other child's actions are described as \"violently hugging\" and not stopping even when the girl yells. That sounds like inappropriate behavior that's not respecting her space.\n\nThe parent's advice is to use \"legit force\" in self-defense. They mention that they don't support general violence but this is a specific case where the daughter is being forced. The spouse argues that using violence is never the solution and that they should rely on adults. \n\nI think the key here is the concept of self-defense. If a child is being physically forced in a way that's harmful or non-consensual, teaching them to defend themselves seems reasonable. However, at 4 years old, the ability to assess and respond appropriately might be limited. The parent is giving clear instructions for specific situations where the other child isn't respecting the daughter's boundaries despite her trying to communicate through words (yelling). \n\nOn the other hand, the spouse's concern is valid because encouraging physical confrontation might escalate the situation. Also, the role of teachers and daycare staff is important. The parent mentions that the teachers aren't able to catch the behavior in action, which complicates things. But if the daughter has already tried telling the teachers without success, the parent might feel they need to empower the child to protect herself.\n\nI should also consider developmental appropriateness. A 4-year-old might not have the emotional maturity to handle pushing back without it getting worse. However, the parent is specific about using force only when necessary and in response to force. It's a balance between teaching the child to stand up for herself and avoiding a cycle of violence.\n\nAnother angle is the message about consent and boundaries. Teaching the daughter that she has the right to say no and that it's okay to physically remove herself from an uncomfortable situation is important. The parent is trying to reinforce that she can protect herself when verbal communication isn't enough. But there's a risk in teaching a child to use physical force, even if it's in self-defense, as it might normalize hitting others when frustrated.\n\nIn conclusion, the parent's intentions are good\u2014to protect their child and teach her about personal boundaries. However, the approach might be too direct for a 4-year-old. Maybe a better solution would be to involve the daycare more aggressively, perhaps by documenting incidents or discussing with the other child's parents (if appropriate). The spouse's concern about using non-violent methods aligns with the general advice for young children to resolve conflicts without physical force. So, while the parent's motivation is understandable, the method might not be the most appropriate given the child's age and the potential for escalation.\n"
