Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. So the question is whether the parent is in the wrong for advising their 4-year-old to push away another kid who's hugging her violently. The parent says the kid is being forceful, even after the child tells the teachers, and the parent tells their daughter it's okay to push back. The spouse disagrees, saying it's better to tell the teachers and avoid violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. Four years old is pretty young. At that age, kids are still learning social boundaries and how to handle conflicts. The parent is trying to teach their daughter to protect herself in a situation where she's being uncomfortable. The other child is forcing physical contact, which the parent refers to as \"legit violence.\" But is pushing back considered violence here?\n\nThe spouse argues that using any form of violence is wrong, and that the child should rely on adults. The parent's reasoning is about self-defense, teaching the child to assert herself. But is that appropriate for a 4-year-old? Maybe the child isn't equipped to handle physical confrontation, especially if the other child retaliates. The parent also mentions that the child is \"clever enough to recognize the difference,\" but at that age, their understanding of force and violence might be limited.\n\nThe daycare teachers aren't handling it effectively, so the parent is stepping in. However, the parent's approach might be teaching the child that physical response is acceptable in certain situations. But is that a good lesson for a four-year-old? Maybe there are other ways to teach her to set boundaries without involving physical action. Like using words, moving away, or seeking help immediately.\n\nAlso, the parent's method could escalate the situation if the other child pushes back, leading to more conflict. The child's safety is a priority, but teaching a young child to push back might not be the safest solution. The spouse's point about reporting to adults is valid because professionals should handle such issues, especially in a daycare setting.\n\nThere's also the aspect of legal and institutional policies. Daycares often have specific guidelines on how children should handle conflicts, which might prohibit physical retaliation. The parent might be violating those policies by encouraging the child to push back.\n\nIn terms of child development, experts often recommend teaching children to use verbal cues and seek adult help rather than teaching them to use force. Physical responses at this age can be seen as aggressive behavior, which might not be developmentally appropriate. The child's primary role in daycare is to learn social skills and conflict resolution under adult supervision.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the parent's advice might not be the best approach. The child is too young to understand the nuances of self-defense versus aggression. The spouse's approach of relying on adults is more aligned with developmental guidelines and the daycare's responsibility to manage such situations. Therefore, the parent is likely in the wrong here.\n"
