Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent is wrong for telling their 4-year-old to push away another kid who's hugging and kissing her too forcefully. The parent and their spouse disagree on whether this is appropriate.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The child is being physically overwhelmed by another kid, even after she tells him to stop. The teachers aren't able to catch it because it's happening suddenly, and the kid doesn't stop. The parent is teaching the daughter to use force to protect herself if she's being hurt. The spouse thinks she should just report it to teachers and not use any violence.\n\nSo, the key points here are about teaching a young child to defend herself in a situation where she's being physically uncomfortable and the system isn't working. The parent is emphasizing that it's okay to push back if someone is doing something harmful. The spouse is concerned about encouraging violence, even if it's defensive.\n\nIn terms of child safety, it's important that a child knows how to protect herself when adults aren't around. Teaching a child to recognize when they're being harmed and to take action could be seen as empowering them. However, there's also the aspect of conflict resolution and teaching non-violence. But in this case, the other child isn't stopping, even when told, so the parent is trying to prevent harm.\n\nI think the parent's approach is reasonable because they're not teaching the child to initiate violence, but to respond to actual physical harm. The parent is also emphasizing telling an adult after. The spouse's concern is valid, but if the teachers aren't effective, the child needs another strategy. The parent is trying to teach her to protect herself, which is a common self-defense concept even for children.\n\nSo, the answer is B. The parent isn't in the wrong here because they're helping their child understand how to handle a threatening situation when other measures aren't working.\n"
