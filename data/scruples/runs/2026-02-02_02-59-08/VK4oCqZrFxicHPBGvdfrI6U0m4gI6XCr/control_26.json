Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent is wrong for teaching their 4-year-old to push away another kid who's hugging her violently. The parent's spouse thinks they should avoid violence and just tell the teachers. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The other kid is being physical in a way that's making their daughter uncomfortable. The daughter has already told the teachers, but it's not stopping. The parent is advising her to use force if necessary to protect herself. \n\nThe parent's argument is that this is \"legit violence\" because the other child is being aggressive. They mention that the daughter is old enough to understand the difference. The spouse is against teaching violence, preferring to rely on adults.\n\nI should think about child development. At 4 years old, kids are learning about personal space and boundaries. Teaching a child to stand up for themselves is important, but using physical force might teach aggression. However, in this case, the child is being forced into uncomfortable physical contact, which is a form of violence. The parent is trying to empower the child to protect herself when adults aren't available.\n\nOn the other hand, encouraging a child to use violence could lead to more conflict. The teachers might not handle it effectively, so maybe the parent is trying to prepare the child for situations where help isn't immediately available. But there's a risk that the child might escalate the situation, leading to a physical fight.\n\nAlso, the parent mentions that they are generally against violence but see this as a case of self-defense. The advice includes pushing back and then running to an adult, which isn't pure violence but a way to de-escalate after asserting boundaries.\n\nI think the parent isn't entirely wrong because they're teaching self-defense in a specific context. However, the spouse's concern about promoting violence is valid. The key is whether the parent's approach is appropriate. Since the parent emphasizes using force only when necessary and then seeking help, maybe it's a balanced approach. But maybe the parent should also teach other ways to handle it, like using words first. However, given the situation and the child's age, the parent is trying to protect their daughter from ongoing harassment. So the answer might be B (no, the parent isn't wrong) because they're teaching self-defense in a situation where the child is being physically forced, and they're not encouraging aggression without cause.\n"
