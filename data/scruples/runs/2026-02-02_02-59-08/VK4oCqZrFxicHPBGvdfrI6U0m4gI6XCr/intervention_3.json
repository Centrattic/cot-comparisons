Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a 4-year-old girl who's being hugged and kissed forcefully by another kid at daycare. The parents are in a disagreement over whether it's okay to encourage the daughter to push the other kid away as a form of self-defense or if she should only rely on reporting to teachers.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. At 4 years old, kids are still learning social boundaries and how to communicate their feelings. The author is teaching their daughter that it's okay to use physical force to stop someone who's being overly affectionate, even if it's another child. The other parent (the SO) is concerned that this might lead to more violence or that the daughter might escalate the situation, maybe by pushing back or not knowing when to stop. \n\nThe key points here are: the other child is using force that's uncomfortable, sometimes even when the daughter says she doesn't want it. The teachers aren't effective because the behavior happens when they aren't looking, and the other kid doesn't stop even after being told by adults. So the author is trying to empower their daughter to defend herself in a situation where the adults aren't able to intervene effectively. \n\nBut wait, is pushing another child considered teaching them to use violence? The author says they're \"very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids,\" so this might be an exception. However, even if it's a \"legit\" situation, like self-defense, for a 4-year-old, the line between self-defense and aggression can be blurry. Teaching a child to push someone in response might normalize physical confrontation, which could lead to her using similar tactics in other non-violent situations. Also, the child might not have the judgment to discern when such force is appropriate, leading to potential misunderstandings or conflicts.\n\nThe SO's argument is that it's better to rely on teachers and avoid any form of violence altogether. That approach emphasizes non-violent conflict resolution and trusting adults to handle the situation. But if the teachers aren't effective, maybe that's not the solution. Still, the child's safety and emotional well-being are paramount. The author is concerned about the daughter being hurt or forced into unwanted contact, so pushing back could be seen as a way to stop the immediate harm. \n\nHowever, the daycare's role is to provide a safe environment. If the other child is being aggressive, maybe the parents should be informed first, or there could be a need for the daycare to adjust their supervision strategies. Encouraging a child to use physical force might not be the best approach in a structured educational setting where conflict resolution is typically taught through communication and adult mediation. \n\nAlso, the daughter's fear of retaliation (the other kid pushing back or beating her) suggests she's aware of potential escalation. The author's advice to push back again or run and tell an adult could lead to a cycle of violence between the kids. At such a young age, the child might not be able to manage the situation effectively on her own, and the daycare might not handle it well if the kids start fighting. \n\nAnother angle is the moral message about self-defense versus violence. The author might believe that teaching their daughter to protect herself is necessary. But 4-year-olds don't have the maturity to assess threats accurately. They might misinterpret a hug as a threat even if it's not meant to be violent. Plus, the physical response could lead to the daughter being blamed if the other child gets hurt, which is a real concern in a daycare setting. \n\nIn terms of child development, it's important to teach a 4-year-old how to express her discomfort verbally, set boundaries, and seek help from adults. Physical confrontation, even if minimal, might not be the appropriate method at that age. The daycare's responsibility is to manage such interactions, so maybe the parents should work with the daycare to find a solution, like moving the children apart, increasing supervision, or teaching the other child better social skills. \n\nThe author's intention is understandable\u2014protecting their child from unwanted physical contact. But the method of teaching physical resistance might not be the best approach. Instead, reinforcing communication and non-physical ways to respond, like saying \"no\" more firmly, walking away, or immediately seeking a teacher's help, could be more effective and in line with developmental expectations. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author might be in the wrong because they're encouraging a 4-year-old to use physical force, which can have unintended consequences and isn't the most age-appropriate way to handle the situation. The focus should be on teaching the child to use their voice and seek adult intervention, not on defending herself with a push. The SO's concern about avoiding violence and relying on the daycare's structure is valid, especially given the child's age and the potential for escalation.\n"
