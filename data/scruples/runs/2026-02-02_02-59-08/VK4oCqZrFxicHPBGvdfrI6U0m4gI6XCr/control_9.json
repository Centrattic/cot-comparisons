Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent is wrong for encouraging their 4-year-old daughter to push away another kid who's hugging her too forcefully. The parent's reasoning is that the other child is being violent and not respecting her boundaries, even after the daughter has told the teachers. The parent's partner disagrees, thinking she should only tell the teachers and not use any force.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from a child's perspective. At 4 years old, kids are still learning how to handle social interactions and boundaries. The other child is hugging/kissing her too hard, which is making her uncomfortable. The parent is teaching her to protect herself by pushing back if needed, which could be seen as a way to teach self-defense. However, there's a risk here because teaching a 4-year-old to push back might escalate the situation, leading to more conflict or hurt feelings. Also, there's a concern about normalizing the use of physical force, even in self-defense, for a child so young.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent is emphasizing that the force is only in self-defense, not aggression. They're not teaching the child to be violent but to defend herself when someone else is being violent. The parent is also teaching her to run and tell an adult, which is a good strategy. The partner's argument is that the child should rely on adults to resolve the issue, not take matters into her own hands. That's a valid point because it's important for children to learn that they can seek help when they're in uncomfortable situations.\n\nAnother angle is the daycare's responsibility. If the teachers aren't effectively addressing the issue, maybe the parent should be more involved in communicating with the daycare rather than teaching the child to handle it herself. There's also the aspect of the child's emotional development. Teaching a child to push away someone who's being affectionate, even if it's not wanted, might make the other child feel rejected or confused, especially if he's not intentionally being mean. It's possible that the child's behavior stems from his own insecurities or lack of social skills, which the daycare should address.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the parent is trying to protect their child, which is a natural instinct. But the method might not be the best approach for a 4-year-old. The partner's concern about using violence is valid because it's important to teach non-violent conflict resolution. However, the parent is not encouraging random aggression; they're teaching specific self-defense in a situation where the child is being physically overwhelmed. There's a balance between teaching self-defense and ensuring the child doesn't adopt aggressive behaviors.\n\nIn conclusion, while the parent's intentions are good, the approach might not be the most appropriate for a child of that age. The parent could be in the right in terms of protecting their child's boundaries but might be in the wrong for promoting physical confrontation instead of relying on adults first. The answer might depend on cultural or personal parenting styles, but generally, for a 4-year-old, it's more effective to teach them to seek help from adults rather than handle it physically. However, teaching a child to recognize when they're in a dangerous situation and take immediate action is also crucial. So, it's a bit of a grey area, but leaning towards the parent not being in the wrong because they're addressing a specific issue of unwanted physical contact.\n"
