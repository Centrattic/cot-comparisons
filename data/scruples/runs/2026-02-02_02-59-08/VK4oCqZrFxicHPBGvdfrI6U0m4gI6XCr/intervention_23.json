Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for encouraging their 4-year-old to push away another kid who's hugging her too roughly. The parent told the daughter it's okay to push back if the kid won't stop, even to the point of using force. The spouse thinks the parent is wrong and that the daughter should just tell the teachers instead of using violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. A 4-year-old is very young, and their ability to handle such situations might be limited. The parent is trying to teach their child to defend themselves when another child isn't respecting their boundaries. But force at this age could lead to escalation, and the child might not understand when to stop or how to de-escalate a situation. The parent might be overestimating the child's ability to handle this.\n\nThen there's the aspect of teaching violence. Even if it's self-defense, teaching a child to use physical force could set a precedent. The spouse is concerned about the child learning that violence is an acceptable response to conflict. On the other hand, the parent argues that it's about using \"legit violence\" in a situation where the other child is being violent. But at four, the child might not discern when it's okay to push back and when it's not.\n\nThe daycare teachers aren't handling the situation effectively, so the parent is trying to empower the child. However, the parent might not have considered the child's emotional state. The daughter was worried the other kid might push back, so the parent told her to push back and run away. But a 4-year-old might not run away effectively in such a situation; they might freeze or panic instead.\n\nAnother angle is the legal and educational approach. Childcare professionals often have protocols for such issues. Encouraging the child to tell the teachers repeatedly might be more appropriate. If that's not working, the parent should escalate the issue with the daycare rather than teaching the child to defend herself physically.\n\nAlso, the child's emotional well-being is important. The daughter is already feeling uncomfortable and scared. Teaching her to push away might increase her anxiety if the other child retaliates, as the daughter herself mentioned. The parent's solution might not address the deeper issue of the other child's behavior and the need for adult intervention.\n\nIn summary, while the parent's intention is to protect their child, the method might be inappropriate for a 4-year-old's maturity level. Teaching physical resistance could lead to more harm, and there might be better ways to handle the situation through communication and proper channels. The spouse's concern about not using violence is valid here. So, the answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
