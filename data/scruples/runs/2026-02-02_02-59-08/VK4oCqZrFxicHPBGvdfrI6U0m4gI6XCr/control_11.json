Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person (author) is in the wrong for telling their 4-year-old daughter it's okay to push away another kid who's hugging and kissing her too much. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the other kid is hugging and kissing the daughter in a way that's making her uncomfortable. The daughter has tried telling the kid to stop and even told the teachers, but the behavior continues. The author advised the daughter to push back if the other kid won't stop, and even said to push back again or run and tell an adult if the other kid retaliates.\n\nThe spouse thinks the author is wrong, saying it's better to tell the teachers and avoid violence. The author argues it's about legitimate force in a situation where the other kid is being violent.\n\nSo, the main points to consider: Is it appropriate for a 4-year-old to be taught to use physical force to defend herself? Are there better ways to handle this situation? What's the societal or parenting norm here?\n\nI know that teaching children to resolve conflicts without violence is often recommended, especially at a young age. However, the other child's behavior is aggressive and persistent despite the daughter's attempts to communicate her discomfort. The daughter is already being proactive by telling the teachers, but they aren't effective in stopping it. The author might be trying to empower the daughter to protect herself in a moment when adults aren't around.\n\nBut on the other hand, teaching even \"legitimate\" physical responses to a 4-year-old could lead to escalation. The other child might push back, leading to more conflict. Also, the daughter might not understand the nuances of when it's appropriate to use force. The spouse's concern is valid because involving adults is typically the safer route. However, if the adults aren't effective, the daughter might feel she has no choice but to defend herself.\n\nI think the author's intention is to protect their daughter's autonomy and comfort. But maybe there's a middle ground. Maybe the author could have suggested other non-violent but assertive responses, like moving away, using louder verbal cues, or seeking help immediately. Teaching a child to push might be seen as encouraging violence, even if it's in self-defense. Also, the daughter's age is a factor; she's very young and might not fully grasp the consequences of her actions.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because promoting the use of physical force, even in self-defense, for a 4-year-old isn't ideal. There might be better strategies that don't involve teaching children to retaliate physically. The spouse's approach of relying on adults and non-violent solutions is probably more appropriate here.\n"
