Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about their 4-year-old daughter who's being hugged and kissed forcefully by another kid at daycare. The parents talk about encouraging the daughter to push the other kid away if he's being violent. The husband disagrees, saying it's better to tell the teachers and avoid violence. The question is whether the author (the parent) is at fault.\n\nFirst, I should consider the child's age. A 4-year-old might not fully understand social boundaries or how to handle such situations. The other kid is being aggressive, and the daycare teachers aren't effectively addressing it. The parent is trying to teach their daughter to protect herself. But is teaching a child to use physical force appropriate?\n\nOn one hand, the parent is trying to empower their child to defend herself when others are being violent. The kid in question isn't stopping when asked, so the parent sees this as legitimate self-defense. The parent also mentions that they're not encouraging random violence but specific, necessary force.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband is concerned about promoting violence in general, even if it's self-defense. There's also the risk that the other child might react more aggressively. At 4 years old, the child might not have the judgment to discern when force is appropriate, which could lead to conflicts. Also, daycare environments usually have policies against certain behaviors, so maybe the parent should rely more on the system (teachers) even if they're not perfect.\n\nBut in this case, the teachers aren't seeing the behavior and the other child isn't responding to their interventions. The parent's approach might be a way to protect the child when other methods fail. However, physical confrontation could escalate things. Maybe there's a middle ground, like teaching the child to remove herself and seek help, but not necessarily to push.\n\nAlso, the daughter's response about the other kid pushing back shows she's aware of potential retaliation. The parent's advice to push back or run away might be necessary, but is it appropriate for a 4-year-old to handle? The child's safety is the priority, but so is their emotional development.\n\nI think the key here is the balance between self-defense and promoting violence. The parent's intention is to protect their child from harm, which is a natural instinct. However, teaching a child to use physical force at such a young age might not be the best approach, as it could lead to more conflicts or inappropriate responses in other situations. The husband's point about non-violence is valid, but the situation is one where the child is being physically forced.\n\nMaybe the parent is right in this specific context because it's about preventing ongoing harm. But the parent could also work on alternative solutions, like more direct communication with the daycare to address the issue, or involving the other child's parents if possible. Still, given the constraints (teachers aren't effective, other kid's parents are overbearing), the parent's advice might be necessary. However, teaching a child to push could be seen as encouraging violent behavior, which might be against their usual parenting values.\n\nSo, I'm a bit torn. The parent is trying to protect their child, but the method might be questionable. Maybe the parent is not in the wrong because they're acting in self-defense, but the husband's concern about promoting violence is also valid. However, since the situation is legitimate and the child's safety is at stake, the parent might be in the right. Alternatively, the parent could be wrong because they're setting a precedent for using physical force instead of relying on adults to resolve conflicts. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether the parent's actions are seen as teaching necessary self-defense or promoting violence. Given that the parent is careful to specify it's only in cases of violence and not random aggression, maybe they're not in the wrong. But the other perspective is that a 4-year-old might not handle that judgment correctly, leading to unintended consequences. Therefore, the parent might be in the wrong for encouraging physical confrontation at a young age, even if the intent is good. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because it's about legitimate self-defense. Hmm.\n"
