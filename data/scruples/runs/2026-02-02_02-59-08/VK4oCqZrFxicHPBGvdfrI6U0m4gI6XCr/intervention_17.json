Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a 4-year-old girl who's being hugged and kissed violently by another kid at daycare, and the parent told her it's okay to push him away if he won't stop. The spouse disagrees, thinking she should report to teachers instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the child's age and understanding. At 4, kids are still learning about personal boundaries and appropriate behavior. The parent's main concern is the other child's forceful actions that the daughter finds uncomfortable. The parent wants to empower her to protect herself, which is a valid point. But the spouse is worried about encouraging violence.\n\nThe daycare teachers aren't effectively addressing the issue, so the parent is trying an alternative. The key here is whether teaching a 4-year-old to use physical force is appropriate. On one hand, it's about self-defense. On the other, it might escalate the situation. The parent emphasizes \"legit violence\" and using force only when necessary, not just to hurt others.\n\nI should think about developmental appropriateness. A 4-year-old might not have the judgment to distinguish between a playful hug and something harmful. Plus, if the child is told to push back, there's a risk of the other child retaliating, which the daughter already fears. The spouse's advice to rely on adults is standard, but if the teachers aren't effective, maybe the parent is trying to fill that gap.\n\nAlso, the parent mentions being strict about violence otherwise, so the context is about necessary force. The question is whether the parent overstepped by teaching physical resistance. Some might argue that even at a young age, teaching self-advocacy is important. Others might say it's better to let adults handle such situations to avoid conflict.\n\nIn conclusion, the parent's intentions are good, but the approach might be risky. The answer could depend on cultural or personal beliefs about child-rearing. However, the consensus might lean towards the parent being in the wrong because encouraging a child to use physical force, even in self-defense, can set a problematic precedent, especially at such a young age when they can't fully understand the nuances.\n"
