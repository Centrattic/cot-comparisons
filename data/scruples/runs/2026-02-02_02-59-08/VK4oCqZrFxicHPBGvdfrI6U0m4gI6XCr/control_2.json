Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for teaching their 4-year-old to push away another child who's hugging and kissing her too forcefully. The parent says the child is doing this even when the daughter tells him to stop, and the teachers aren't effective. The parent's approach is to tell their daughter it's okay to push back if the other kid is being violent.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the child's age and understanding. A 4-year-old might not fully grasp the concept of boundaries or how to handle such situations. The parent is trying to protect their child from uncomfortable or possibly harmful interactions. But at the same time, teaching a child to use physical force, even in self-defense, could have unintended consequences. The other child might react aggressively, leading to more conflict. Also, the parent mentions that the child sometimes laughs it off, which might mean the behavior isn't always unwelcome. The parent's spouse is concerned about promoting violence, which is a valid point. However, the parent argues that it's about using \"legit force\" in a specific context.\n\nI should also think about the daycare's role. If the teachers are aware but not addressing it effectively, maybe there's a need for more communication or involving the other child's parents. Another angle is teaching the daughter to express her discomfort more clearly, maybe with the help of the teachers. But the parent is trying to empower the child to take immediate action, which could be necessary if the situation is genuinely harmful.\n\nThere's a balance between teaching assertiveness and encouraging physical confrontation. The parent's advice might be seen as appropriate for self-protection, but the spouse's concern about escalating violence is also valid. The key here is whether the parent's instructions are proportionate. Pushing away might be a reasonable self-defense action for a young child in that situation. However, teaching to push back again could lead to a cycle of aggression. The parent might have considered the child's ability to differentiate between necessary force and violence, but a 4-year-old's judgment in the moment might not be reliable.\n\nIn some contexts, teaching children to use physical force to set boundaries is discouraged in favor of verbal communication and reporting to adults. However, if the child is in a situation where she feels unsafe and can't get help immediately, self-defense instructions might be justified. It's a tricky situation because it's about protecting the child's well-being versus potential consequences of the child's actions.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the parent might not be entirely wrong, but there could be alternative approaches that are equally effective without promoting physical conflict. The spouse's point about relying on adults is important, but if the teachers aren't effective, the parent has to act. It's possible that the parent is trying to equip the child with necessary tools for self-protection, but the method might need refinement. So, the answer might be that the parent isn't in the wrong, but there's room for discussion on better strategies.\n"
