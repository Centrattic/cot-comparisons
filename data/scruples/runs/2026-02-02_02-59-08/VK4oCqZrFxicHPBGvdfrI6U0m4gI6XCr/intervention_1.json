Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is at fault for teaching their 4-year-old to push away another child who's hugging too forcefully. The parent's spouse thinks it's better to tell the teachers instead of using violence. The parent argues that their daughter is capable of distinguishing between legitimate force and violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. Four years old is pretty young. At that age, kids are still learning social boundaries and how to communicate their needs. The parent is trying to teach self-defense, but maybe that's too much for a 4-year-old to handle. The other child's actions are inappropriate, but the parent's solution involves physical confrontation.\n\nThe spouse is concerned about promoting violence. There's a line between self-defense and initiating violence. The parent says they're teaching \"legit force,\" but even pushing could escalate the situation. The child might not know how to apply just the right amount of force. Also, if the other kid retaliates, the daughter might be injured. \n\nThe parent mentioned that the teachers haven't been effective. But maybe there are other steps they could take, like more direct communication with the teachers, or involving the other child's parents. Teaching a child to use physical force might not be the best approach when there are adults supposed to intervene. \n\nOn the other hand, the parent is trying to protect their child from uncomfortable or potentially harmful situations. The daughter is already aware of the problem and has tried to tell the teachers. The parent's advice might empower the child to protect herself, but at what cost? \n\nConsidering all this, maybe the parent is in the wrong because they're encouraging a 4-year-old to use physical force, which could lead to more conflict and isn't the most effective solution. The spouse's approach of relying on adults to handle the situation might be more appropriate for a child of that age. The answer would be A.\n"
