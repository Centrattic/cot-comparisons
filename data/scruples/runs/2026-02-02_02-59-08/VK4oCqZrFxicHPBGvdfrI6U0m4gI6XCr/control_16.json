Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the parent is in the wrong here. The situation is about a 4-year-old girl who's being hugged too forcefully by another kid at daycare, even after she tells the kid to stop. The parent advised her daughter to push the kid away if she feels uncomfortable, and to push back or run away if the other kid retaliates. The spouse disagrees, thinking she should just tell the teachers and avoid using violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. At 4 years old, kids are still learning social boundaries and how to express their discomfort. The parent's advice is about self-defense in a situation where the child is being forced into physical contact she doesn't want. The parent emphasizes that it's okay to use force when someone else is being violent. But the spouse is concerned that encouraging any form of violence, even in self-defense, might be inappropriate for a child her age.\n\nDaycare policies often encourage non-violent resolution and communication with adults. However, in this case, the teachers aren't seeing the issue happen, so the child isn't getting the protection she needs. The parent's approach is about empowering the child to protect herself, which can be important. But there's a balance between teaching self-advocacy and teaching violence.\n\nAnother angle is the child's understanding of force. The parent mentions the child is \"old and clever enough\" to know the difference between legitimate self-defense and just aggression. However, at 4 years old, the ability to discern and respond appropriately in the moment might be limited. The child might not know how to de-escalate the situation or might escalate it further by pushing back.\n\nAlso, the parent's advice includes running away and telling an adult, which is good. But the act of pushing could be seen as encouraging violence, even if it's in self-defense. Daycare environments usually have strict rules against physical altercations between children to prevent any form of bullying or aggression.\n\nThe spouse's point is about teaching non-violent solutions, which aligns with many child-rearing philosophies that emphasize communication over conflict. But the parent is also trying to protect their child from immediate harm, which is a natural instinct.\n\nIn terms of the daycare's role, if the teachers aren't able to address the issue when it's reported, the parent might feel justified in taking other measures. However, the correct approach might involve more collaboration with the daycare to address the behavior of the other child, rather than instructing their own child to use force.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the parent might be in the wrong because they're teaching a 4-year-old to use physical force, which could lead to more problems and doesn't teach non-violent resolution. The spouse's approach of relying on adult intervention is more in line with typical daycare guidelines and child development practices for that age.\n"
