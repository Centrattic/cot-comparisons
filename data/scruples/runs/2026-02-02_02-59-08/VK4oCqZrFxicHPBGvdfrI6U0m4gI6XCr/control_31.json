Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent (the author) is in the wrong for advising their 4-year-old daughter to push away another kid who's hugging her too roughly. The parent says the other child is being violent and not stopping even when told. They told their daughter it's okay to push back if it's forced contact. The spouse disagrees, saying it's better to tell the teachers and avoid violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The other child is hugging/kissing too hard, which is making the daughter uncomfortable. The parent is teaching self-defense, but the kid is the same age. At 4, kids are still learning boundaries and how to express discomfort. The parent's advice is about using force to protect herself when other methods (telling the teacher, saying no) haven't worked. \n\nIs it okay to teach a child to push someone away if they're being physically uncomfortable? Well, the parent is emphasizing \"legit violence,\" meaning defensive actions. But the spouse is concerned about teaching violence. However, the situation involves a child who's not respecting the other child's boundaries, and the teachers aren't stopping it. \n\nI think the parent is trying to empower their child to protect herself, which is reasonable. But maybe there's a line between using physical force and teaching aggression. However, in cases of unwanted physical contact, especially when the other child is not respecting \"no,\" it's important for the child to feel they can set boundaries. The parent isn't encouraging unprovoked violence but defensive actions. \n\nAlso, the daughter is already aware of the problem but the other child isn't stopping. The parent's advice might be necessary since the teachers aren't effectively addressing it. So, the parent isn't entirely wrong. However, maybe the approach could be adjusted. For example, teaching the child to say \"no\" louder, seek help immediately, or use a voice to get attention. But the parent's intent is to protect, which is good. \n\nOn the other hand, teaching a 4-year-old to push back might escalate the situation. The other child might retaliate, leading to more conflict. The parent acknowledges this possibility and advises to run away or tell an adult if pushed back. But at that age, kids might not always follow the plan correctly. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The parent is trying to protect their child's well-being and comfort, which is crucial. The spouse's concern is valid too, about avoiding violence. But given the context of forced, unwanted physical contact and the child's repeated inability to stop it, advising defensive actions isn't necessarily wrong. It's about teaching self-advocacy in a safe way. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They're teaching their child to set boundaries when other methods fail, which is important for her safety and self-respect.\n"
