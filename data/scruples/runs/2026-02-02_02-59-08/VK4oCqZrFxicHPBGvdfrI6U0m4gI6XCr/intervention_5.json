Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for advising their 4-year-old to push another kid away if the kid is hugging and kissing them in an uncomfortable way. The situation involves a child who's being physically overwhelmed by another child at daycare, and the parents are arguing about the appropriate response.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the child's age. At 4 years old, the child has limited understanding of social boundaries and might not know how to handle such situations. The parent is trying to protect their daughter from physical affection they find unwanted. The other child isn't stopping when told, and the teachers aren't effective in preventing it.\n\nThe parent's approach is to teach the daughter to use force if necessary. The other parent disagrees, thinking it's better to rely on adults. The key here is whether teaching a child to use physical force is appropriate versus encouraging them to seek help from adults.\n\nOn one hand, teaching a child to defend themselves can be a way to ensure their safety, especially if the other child is not responding to verbal cues. However, at such a young age, the child might not have the judgment to use force appropriately, leading to potential escalations. Also, teaching physical confrontation could normalize violence, even if it's for self-defense.\n\nOn the other hand, the daycare teachers aren't intervening effectively, so the child might need a proactive strategy. The parent is emphasizing that it's okay to push back only when the other child is being violent. But the challenge is that a 4-year-old might not discern the line between appropriate and excessive force.\n\nAnother point is the legal and ethical aspect of self-defense. If a child is being physically touched in a way that's harmful, self-defense could be justified. However, in a daycare setting, the responsibility of the staff is to prevent such interactions. The parent's advice might be a last resort if the system isn't working.\n\nBut maybe the parent should focus more on working with the daycare to address the behavior of the other child's parents or the staff, rather than teaching self-defense to a 4-year-old. The child's safety is important, but the method might need to be age-appropriate. Maybe suggesting that the daughter tells an adult immediately, or uses words to express discomfort, rather than physical force.\n\nAlso, the concern about the other child retaliating is valid. If the daughter pushes back, the other child might push her, leading to a cycle of violence. The parent's advice to push back again could escalate the situation. The alternative would be to step away and seek help, which might be safer.\n\nIn conclusion, while the parent's intention is to protect their child, the method might not be the best approach for a 4-year-old. Encouraging the child to seek adult help and to communicate their discomfort might be more effective and safer. The parent is probably not entirely in the wrong, but there are better strategies available. However, given the daycare's failure to act, the parent's advice is a response to a lack of support, which complicates the situation.\n"
