Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a 4-year-old girl who's being hugged and kissed by another kid in a way that's uncomfortable, even after she tells him to stop. The parent advised the daughter to push the other kid away if he won't stop, and maybe push back or run and tell an adult. The spouse disagrees, saying it's better to tell the teachers and avoid violence.\n\nHmm. So the question is whether the parent is wrong in teaching their daughter to use force in this situation. First, I need to consider the age of the child. Four years old is very young. At that age, kids might not understand the difference between appropriate self-defense and aggression. The parent argues that it's \"legit force\" against unwanted force, but a four-year-old might not have the cognitive ability to distinguish that in the moment. They might just see it as being taught to hit another kid, which could lead to more aggressive behavior.\n\nAlso, the daycare teachers are already involved, but they haven't managed to stop the behavior. The parent is worried their daughter isn't safe. But maybe the right approach is to reinforce non-violent solutions, like teaching the child to clearly communicate her discomfort and to tell a teacher each time it happens. The parent's solution might escalate the situation between the kids, leading to more conflict. \n\nOn the other hand, the parent's intention is to protect their daughter from being hurt. But the methods might be inappropriate for a preschooler. The spouse's stance is about avoiding violence, which aligns with teaching non-violent conflict resolution. The daycare should be held more accountable. Maybe the parent should work more closely with the daycare to address the other child's behavior instead of teaching their daughter to respond with force. \n\nSo, considering all that, the parent might be overstepping. Teaching a 4-year-old to use physical force could set a bad precedent and might not be the most effective solution. The daycare needs to handle the other child's behavior more effectively, and the parent should focus on that rather than encouraging their own child to defend herself physically at such a young age. Therefore, the parent is in the wrong.\n"
