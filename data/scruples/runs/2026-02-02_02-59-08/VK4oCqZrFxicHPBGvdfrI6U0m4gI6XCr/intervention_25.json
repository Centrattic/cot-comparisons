Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent (the author) is in the wrong for teaching their 4-year-old daughter to push away another child who's hugging her violently. The parent and their spouse are in conflict over this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The other child is hugging and kissing the daughter in a way that's uncomfortable, even when the daughter protests. The teachers aren't effectively addressing it. The parent's advice is to use physical force to push back if the other child doesn't stop. The spouse is against this, advocating for non-violent solutions like reporting to teachers.\n\nNow, the key points: The daughter is 4, which is a very young age. At this age, children are still learning social boundaries and how to handle conflicts. The parent is teaching the daughter to use physical force as a defense. But is that appropriate? On one hand, the parent is trying to empower the child to protect herself in a situation where she's being harmed. On the other hand, teaching a 4-year-old to use violence might set a precedent for aggressive behavior. The parent mentions they are generally strict about non-violence, which is a good point. But the justification here is \"legit force\" against someone who's being violent. However, a 4-year-old might not fully understand the difference between appropriate force and aggression. There's also the risk that the other child might retaliate, as the daughter mentioned, and the parent's advice includes pushing back again or running away. \n\nAnother angle is the responsibility of adults to intervene. The spouse's argument is about reporting to teachers, which is a non-violent solution. The child has already tried that, but the teachers aren't effective. So the parent is stepping in because the system isn't working. However, even if the teachers aren't effective, the parent might still be violating the daycare's policies by encouraging the child to use physical force. The daycare probably has procedures for handling such situations, and the parent's advice could interfere with those procedures or even lead to disciplinary issues for the daughter if she acts out.\n\nAlso, the legal and ethical aspect: In many places, teaching a child to use physical force in such situations might not be considered appropriate unless it's self-defense against clear harm. But a 4-year-old's understanding of self-defense is limited. The parent is instructing the child to use force preemptively, which could be seen as encouraging aggression rather than teaching how to seek help. \n\nIn terms of child development, it's important to teach children how to communicate their boundaries and seek help from adults. Encouraging physical responses at such a young age might not be the best approach. Even if the other child is being violent, the parent's approach could lead the daughter to escalate conflicts rather than learning to navigate social situations with adults.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the parent might be in the wrong because they're promoting a violent solution for a 4-year-old in a scenario where non-violent methods haven't worked. The spouse's concern about non-violence and relying on adults to handle the situation is valid. The parent's intention is good, but the method might not be age-appropriate or appropriate within the context of a daycare setting where adults are supposed to manage such interactions.\n"
