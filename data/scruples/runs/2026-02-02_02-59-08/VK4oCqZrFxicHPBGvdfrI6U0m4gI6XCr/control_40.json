Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for telling their 4-year-old to push away another kid who's hugging her too forcefully. The parent's reasoning is that the other child is being violent and not stopping when told, so using some force to push back is okay. The spouse thinks the parent is wrong because kids shouldn't use violence, and they should just tell a teacher.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. Four years old is very young. Their understanding of social interactions and appropriate responses is still developing. Teaching a child to use physical force might be seen as promoting aggression, even if the parent's intention is to protect the child. However, the other child is exhibiting behaviors that could be considered aggressive or non-consensual, like forceful hugs and kisses. The parent is trying to teach their daughter self-defense in a situation where the other child isn't respecting her boundaries.\n\nBut wait, the daycare teachers haven't been effective in stopping the behavior. The parent feels they need to step in because the system isn't working. However, teaching a 4-year-old to push someone might escalate the situation. The daughter even worries the other kid might push back, so the parent's advice includes pushing back and running to an adult. \n\nThe parent emphasizes that it's about \"legit violence,\" meaning defending against violence. But is pushing someone considered appropriate for a 4-year-old? In daycare settings, staff usually discourage physical responses to teach children to use words and seek help. The spouse's point is valid because teaching kids to use violence can lead to cycles of aggression. \n\nOn the other hand, the child is being subjected to unwanted physical contact, which is a form of bullying. The parent is trying to empower the child to protect herself. The key here is whether the method of teaching is age-appropriate. At four, children might not have the judgment to discern when force is necessary, which could lead to misuse. Also, the daycare's responsibility is to handle such issues, so maybe the parent should focus on ensuring the daycare addresses it more effectively, perhaps by escalating the issue to higher authorities or discussing strategies with the teachers.\n\nSo, the parent's intention is to protect their child, which is natural, but the method might not be the best for a four-year-old. The spouse is right in suggesting non-violent solutions, like reporting to adults. Therefore, the parent might be in the wrong for promoting physical responses instead of alternative strategies that align with early childhood education practices.\n"
