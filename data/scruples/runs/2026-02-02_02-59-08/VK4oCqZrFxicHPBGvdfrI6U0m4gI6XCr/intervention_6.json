Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who encouraged their 4-year-old to push away another child who's hugging her too forcefully is in the wrong. The scenario involves a daycare situation where the child is being hugged or kissed in a way that's uncomfortable, and the parents are divided on whether to teach their daughter to push back or to just rely on telling adults.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. Four years old is pretty young, and their understanding of appropriate social interactions is still developing. The parent is trying to teach their daughter self-defense in a situation where another child is being overly affectionate, even after being told to stop. The parent argues that it's about using \"legit force\" to stop unwanted violence, while the spouse thinks non-violence is better.\n\nI remember that in child development, teaching young children to assert themselves is important for their confidence and safety. However, encouraging physical retaliation, even if it's just pushing, might set a precedent for using violence as a solution. It's a delicate balance between protecting the child and teaching non-violent conflict resolution.\n\nAlso, the daycare staff's role here is crucial. The daughter has already told the teachers, but they aren't seeing the incidents. The parent is advising the child to take direct action instead of relying solely on adults. But at 4, a child might not have the judgment to assess when to push back or run, and there's a risk of escalating the situation. The spouse's concern about teaching violence is valid because even minor physical responses can be misinterpreted or lead to more conflict.\n\nAnother angle is the potential for the other child to react aggressively. The daughter herself mentions the fear of the other kid pushing back. If the parent's advice leads to further aggression, that's a problem. However, the parent is teaching the child to protect herself in a way that's proportionate to the situation\u2014pushing away rather than hitting or more severe actions.\n\nI should also consider the context of the hugs. If they're not truly violent but just too forceful for the child's comfort, maybe pushing isn't the best approach. It's more of a personal space issue. In that case, teaching the child to say \"no\" or to walk away might be more appropriate. But at 4, verbal communication might not always be effective if the other child isn't listening.\n\nThe parent's justification is about using force in a situation of \"legit violence,\" but is a hug really violent? It might be intrusive or uncomfortable, but not necessarily violent. The line between affection and aggression can be blurry. So, teaching a physical response might be overstepping if the situation isn't truly aggressive.\n\nOn the other hand, if the other child is being persistent and not respecting the daughter's boundaries despite verbal cues, then physical intervention could be a way for the child to enforce her own boundaries. But again, at such a young age, the child might not have the emotional regulation to handle that without escalating things.\n\nIn terms of legal and ethical considerations, parents have a duty to protect their children from harm. If the hugs are causing distress, then teaching self-defense in a controlled way might be seen as protective. However, the daycare's role is to manage such interactions, and the parents might be overstepping by instructing the child to take matters into her own hands instead of relying on the adults present.\n\nSo, weighing all these factors: the child's age, the nature of the interaction (hugs vs. actual violence), the effectiveness of teaching physical responses vs. communication, and the daycare's responsibility. The parent's approach might be well-intentioned but could be misguided in terms of how a 4-year-old should handle such situations. The spouse's perspective of relying on telling adults and avoiding violence is more about fostering non-aggressive solutions, which is important for social development.\n\nTherefore, the answer might lean towards the parent being in the wrong, but it's a nuanced situation where both perspectives have valid points. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, considering the child's age and the appropriateness of the response, the answer is likely A.\n"
