Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The parent is talking about a 4-year-old who's being hugged forcefully by another kid at daycare. The kid won't stop even when the daughter says no, and the teachers aren't catching it. The parent told their daughter it's okay to push the other kid away and even to push back if needed, or run and tell an adult. The spouse disagrees, thinking it's better to go to the teachers and avoid violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the children. Four-year-olds are still learning social boundaries and how to express their discomfort. The parent is trying to teach their daughter self-defense in a situation where she's being physically uncomfortable. The other child's behavior is aggressive and not respecting her boundaries, so the parent's advice is about asserting her own space.\n\nOn the other hand, the spouse thinks that teaching a child to use force (even non-lethal) might escalate the conflict. Daycare staff are supposed to handle such issues, so maybe the parent should rely more on the daycare's intervention. However, the parent mentions that the teachers aren't seeing it happen, so the daughter can't rely on adults to stop it each time.\n\nIs pushing a child away considered violence? In this context, maybe it's more of a self-defense measure. The parent is teaching the daughter to protect herself when her verbal boundaries aren't respected. But at 4, kids might not understand the concept of consent fully, so the parent is trying to empower her.\n\nBut there's a risk that teaching a child to use physical force could lead to more aggressive behavior. The daycare is a place where kids learn to resolve conflicts without violence. If the daughter starts pushing others, the daycare might take disciplinary action, which could be more harmful.\n\nAnother angle: the parent is modeling that it's okay to use \"legit force\" when someone is being violent. However, the line between self-defense and initiating violence is thin for a young child. The daughter might not differentiate well, leading to unintended consequences.\n\nAlso, the parent's approach could be seen as encouraging proactive physical response, which might not be the best way to teach conflict resolution. The spouse's point about going to teachers first is valid, especially since the daycare has a responsibility to manage such situations. If the teachers aren't addressing it, maybe the parent should escalate to the daycare management or parents of the other child, rather than teaching their daughter to defend herself physically.\n\nIn terms of the daughter's age, 4 is very young. Her ability to assess when it's appropriate to push back and when to run might not be fully developed. The parent is trying to teach her self-advocacy, but the method might be too aggressive for her age group.\n\nSo, considering all that, is the parent in the wrong? On one hand, they're trying to protect their daughter from being forced into physical contact. On the other hand, encouraging physical resistance in a daycare setting might not be the best solution, especially when there are adults who should be managing the environment.\n\nThe daycare's role is to ensure children's safety and teach them how to interact. If the teachers aren't handling the issue, the parent's responsibility is to work with the daycare to resolve it. Teaching a child to use force could be seen as circumventing the daycare's duty and might model inappropriate behavior for the child.\n\nTherefore, the parent might be in the wrong by encouraging physical resistance instead of focusing on other methods to address the problem through the daycare's systems.\n"
