Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The parent is advising their 4-year-old to push away another kid who is hugging and kissing her too forcefully. The other kid doesn't stop even when she tells him. The parent's reasoning is that it's okay to use \"legit force\" in self-defense if someone is hurting her and won't stop. The spouse disagrees, thinking it's better to tell a teacher and avoid violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. A 4-year-old is very young, so their understanding of boundaries and how to handle situations is developing. The parent is trying to teach their daughter to protect herself, which is a valid concern. However, the method suggested\u2014pushing or even pushing back\u2014might be seen as encouraging violence. The spouse's point is that teaching non-violence and reporting to adults is better, which is a common approach in child-rearing.\n\nBut the situation is about a child who is being physically forced into hugs and kisses against their will, which could be considered a form of unwanted touch or even a form of abuse. In such cases, teaching a child to set boundaries is important. However, the parent's advice might be interpreted as promoting physical aggression rather than teaching the child to use words or seek help. The line between self-defense and initiating violence can be blurry, especially for a young child.\n\nAlso, the daycare teachers aren't effectively addressing the issue, so the parent is trying to fill that gap. But is it appropriate for a 4-year-old to handle this on their own? Maybe not. The child might not have the emotional maturity to assess when the force is necessary or how to respond without escalating the situation. The parent's approach could inadvertently lead to more conflict or teach the child that physical force is an acceptable solution.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent is trying to empower the child to stand up for herself, which is beneficial. But the method might not be age-appropriate. The spouse's concern is valid because encouraging a child to use physical force could lead to negative consequences, both legally and socially, if the child is seen as the aggressor.\n\nIn terms of societal norms and child-rearing practices, many experts advise against teaching young children to use physical force to solve problems. Instead, emphasizing communication and seeking adult help is usually recommended. So, while the parent's intention is good, the method might be misguided. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
