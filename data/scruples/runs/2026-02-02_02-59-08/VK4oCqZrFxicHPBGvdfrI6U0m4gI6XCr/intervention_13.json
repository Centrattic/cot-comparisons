Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who encouraged their daughter to push away another kid is in the wrong. The situation involves a 4-year-old girl who's being hugged and kissed very forcefully by another child, causing her discomfort. The parent told the daughter it's okay to push the other kid away if he's being violent and not stopping even when she yells.\n\nThe parent's spouse thinks they're wrong to encourage physical response, arguing that the daughter should just tell the teachers and not use violence. The parent's defense is that they're teaching her to use legitimate force in a situation where someone is forcing themselves on her, and they emphasize not using violence otherwise.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider age-appropriate behavior. At 4 years old, kids are still learning social boundaries and how to handle conflicts. The child is clearly distressed by the other kid's actions. The parent is trying to teach self-defense and assertiveness, which might be a good approach in some contexts. But the spouse is concerned about promoting violence even if it's in self-defense.\n\nOn one hand, teaching a child to stand up for themselves can be empowering. If the other child's actions are indeed forceful and unwanted, the parent might be helping their daughter protect herself. The parent also mentions that the teachers aren't effectively addressing the issue, so the daughter might feel she has no other recourse.\n\nOn the other hand, teaching a 4-year-old to push someone could have unintended consequences. It might escalate the situation, leading to more conflict or even retaliation from the other child. The parent acknowledges that the daughter expressed fear of the other child pushing back, and the parent advised pushing back or running away. But at that age, a child might not have the judgment to assess when force is appropriate or how to de-escalate a situation safely.\n\nAlso, there's a bigger question about how to handle such situations in educational settings. The daycare isn't addressing it, so maybe the parent should focus on working more closely with the teachers or daycare staff to find a solution rather than teaching the child to handle it physically. The spouse's approach of relying on adults to intervene is more about fostering communication and problem-solving without physical escalation.\n\nBut the parent's argument is that the child is being violated and the teachers aren't effective. So they have to give the child tools to protect herself. It's a tricky balance between teaching assertiveness and avoiding violence. The parent's approach might be seen as teaching the child to use physical force, which could conflict with their generally anti-violence stance unless there's a clear understanding of when it's acceptable.\n\nI think the key points are: the child's well-being, the effectiveness of the solution, and the message it sends about conflict resolution. If the other child's behavior is truly aggressive and non-consensual, then teaching self-defense might be justified. However, the parent's method might not be the best approach for a 4-year-old, given their limited ability to handle such situations. The spouse's concern about promoting violence, even in self-defense, could be valid if it leads to more physical altercations.\n\nSo, is the parent in the wrong? It's a nuanced situation. They're trying to protect their daughter from discomfort, which is a good intention. But the method of teaching her to push may not be the most appropriate. The answer might depend on cultural context, the daycare's policies, and the potential consequences of the daughter's actions. I'm leaning towards the parent being in the wrong because encouraging physical responses at such a young age might not be the best approach, especially when there are other avenues to explore with the daycare staff.\n"
