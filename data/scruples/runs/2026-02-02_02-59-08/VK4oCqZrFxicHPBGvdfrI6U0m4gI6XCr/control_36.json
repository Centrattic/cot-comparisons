Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The parent is asking if they're in the wrong for advising their 4-year-old daughter to push away another kid who's hugging and kissing her violently. The key points here are the child's age, the nature of the other kid's actions, and the parent's response.\n\nFirst, the other child is being aggressive, using forceful hugs and kisses that the daughter finds uncomfortable. The daughter has already reported this to teachers, but it's not stopping. The parent is teaching their child to use \"legit violence\" as a defense, meaning to push back if the other kid won't stop. The spouse disagrees, saying it's better to tell teachers and avoid violence entirely.\n\nNow, considering the child's age, 4 years old is very young. Their understanding of right and wrong, self-defense, and authority might not be fully developed. The mother is trying to empower her daughter to protect herself in a situation where adult intervention isn't working. But teaching a 4-year-old to use force could lead to escalation or confusion, as the daughter herself worries about retaliation. Additionally, the parent mentions they are strict about not using violence otherwise, so this seems like a specific case of self-defense.\n\nHowever, the spouse's concern is valid too. Teaching a child to respond with violence, even if it's for self-defense, might not be the best approach. There's a risk that the child might interpret the advice too broadly or use it inappropriately. Also, at 4, children might not have the emotional maturity to discern when force is justified or how to de-escalate a situation without causing more harm.\n\nThe daycare's role is also a factor. If the teachers are not effectively addressing the issue, the parent might need to escalate the problem to the daycare management rather than relying on the child to handle it. The daughter's safety is the priority, but the method used to ensure it should align with the child's developmental stage.\n\nIn conclusion, while the parent's intention is to protect their daughter, the approach might be inappropriate for a 4-year-old. The parent could be in the wrong because encouraging a young child to use physical force without considering non-violent alternatives (like seeking help) and the potential for misunderstanding the advice might not be the best strategy. The spouse's suggestion to focus on reporting the issue to adults is more aligned with teaching conflict resolution through authority.\n"
