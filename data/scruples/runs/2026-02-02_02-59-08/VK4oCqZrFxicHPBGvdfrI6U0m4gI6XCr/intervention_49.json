Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for encouraging their 4-year-old to push away another kid who's hugging her too hard. The parent argues that it's legitimate self-defense since the other child isn't stopping despite the daughter's protests. The spouse disagrees, saying it's better to report it to teachers and avoid violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. Four years old is very young, and their understanding of boundaries and appropriate responses is still developing. The parent's approach is to teach the child to use force if necessary, but at this age, children might not have the judgment to discern when force is appropriate and when it's not. The child's husband is concerned about promoting violence, which is valid because even if the parent says it's not about beating others up, a 4-year-old might not make that distinction. Also, in daycare settings, teachers are supposed to supervise and intervene. The parent's daughter already reported the issue, but the teachers didn't act effectively. However, parents are generally responsible for guiding their children through non-violent means first, especially at such a young age. The parent's advice might lead to more conflict or escalate the situation between the kids. The child's safety and emotional well-being are important, but teaching self-defense at four might be premature. It's possible that the daycare has policies in place, and the parent should focus on addressing the daycare's handling of the situation rather than teaching the child to handle it physically. The spouse's concern is about violence, and while the parent is trying to protect their daughter, the method might not be age-appropriate. So, considering all these factors, the parent might be in the wrong for encouraging physical confrontation instead of relying on the daycare's supervision and further communication with teachers. Therefore, the answer would be A.\n"
