Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the parent is wrong for telling their 4-year-old daughter it's okay to push away another kid who's hugging her too hard or kissing her without consent. The parent argues that the child is being forced into uncomfortable physical contact and that the teachers aren't effectively stopping it. The spouse thinks the parent should have just told the teachers, not taught the child to use force.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the child's age and understanding. Four years old is pretty young, so they might not fully grasp the concept of consent or how to handle uncomfortable situations. The parent is trying to teach the child to protect herself, which is a valid concern. However, teaching a child to use physical force, even in self-defense, could have unintended consequences. Maybe the child might misuse the advice or escalate situations with other kids.\n\nBut the other child is being aggressive, not just playful. The parent mentions the child forces kisses and doesn't stop even when told. That's a form of unwanted contact, which can be traumatic for a young child. The parent's approach is about setting boundaries, which is important. However, the spouse is right to be concerned about encouraging violence. Even if it's defensive, teaching a child to push someone might not be the best approach. There might be better ways to handle it, like teaching the child to say \"no\" firmly or to go to a teacher immediately.\n\nThe child already tried telling the teachers, but they didn't intervene. So the parent is stepping in because the system isn't working. But maybe there are other steps they could take first, like escalating the issue with the daycare or involving the other child's parents if appropriate. Also, the parent's advice to push back might not be the safest option for a 4-year-old. Physical confrontation with another child could lead to the child being blamed or the situation getting worse.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent is trying to protect their daughter from ongoing discomfort and possible trauma. The advice given is specific to a situation where the other child is being violent, so it's about using \"legit force\" in self-defense. The key is whether the parent is teaching the child to use violence as a first resort. The parent clarifies they didn't say to beat kids up, just to push away when necessary. The spouse is worried about the child using violence in general, which is a valid concern.\n\nIn terms of child development, teaching a child to set boundaries is good, but using physical force at such a young age might not be the best method. It's possible that other strategies, like teaching the child to walk away, tell an adult immediately, or use their voice to say no, could be more effective and safer. The parent's approach might be necessary due to the daycare's failure to address the issue, but there's a fine line between teaching self-defense and encouraging violence.\n\nOverall, while the parent's intention is to protect their child, the method might not be the most appropriate. Maybe the parent is not entirely wrong, but there could be better alternatives. However, the parent is acting out of concern for their child's well-being. The spouse's concern is also valid because introducing violence into a child's problem-solving toolkit can have downsides. It's a complex situation where both sides have valid points. The parent might not be in the wrong, but there's room for improvement in how the situation is handled.\n"
