Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is wrong for telling their 4-year-old daughter it's okay to push another kid who's hugging her too forcefully. The parent argues that the child might be using \"legit force\" in a situation where she's being forced to hug/kiss against her will, and that the teachers aren't addressing it. The spouse thinks the parent is wrong because they're encouraging violence instead of reporting to teachers.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. At 4 years old, children are still learning boundaries and how to express discomfort. The parent is teaching the daughter to assert herself physically if she's uncomfortable. But is physical force appropriate here? The other child is also 4, so maybe the parent is trying to empower their daughter to defend herself when verbal communication isn't effective.\n\nOn the other hand, the spouse is concerned about encouraging violence. The line between self-defense and violence can be blurry, especially with young kids. The parent says they emphasized only pushing if the other kid is being violent and not to beat others up. But even so, teaching a 4-year-old to push someone might escalate the situation. The daughter is already worried the other kid might push back, so the parent's advice could lead to more conflict.\n\nAlso, the daycare teachers are supposed to handle such situations. The parent says the teachers aren't seeing it, but maybe there's a way to address it differently, like more consistent reporting or specific strategies. The parent's approach might be a reaction to the daycare's failure to act, but is it the parent's role to intervene directly?\n\nAnother point is the daughter's age. She's very young, so her ability to assess when it's appropriate to push might be limited. The parent is trusting the child's judgment, but maybe that's risky. The daughter might misinterpret the situation or use the advice inappropriately.\n\nIn terms of child development, communication is key. The parent might be teaching self-advocacy, but physical solutions might not be the best for a preschooler. The spouse's stance is about non-violence, which is a common parenting value. There's a balance between teaching self-defense and maintaining non-aggression.\n\nI should also consider if hugging/kissing without consent is a form of violence. The parent refers to it as \"legit violence,\" which is a strong term. Maybe it's more about consent and respecting personal space, rather than physical violence. The parent might be using the term to emphasize the seriousness of the issue.\n\nThe daycare's role is another factor. If they're not addressing it, the parent might feel they have to act. But involving the daycare more effectively could be another approach. Maybe the parent needs to work with the daycare to find a solution rather than instructing the child to handle it herself.\n\nIn summary, while the parent's intentions are to protect their child and teach self-defense, the approach might not be the most appropriate for a 4-year-old. Encouraging physical retaliation could lead to more conflict and might not teach the child effective conflict resolution skills. The spouse's concern about non-violence and relying on adults to handle the situation might be more aligned with developmental needs at this age.\n"
