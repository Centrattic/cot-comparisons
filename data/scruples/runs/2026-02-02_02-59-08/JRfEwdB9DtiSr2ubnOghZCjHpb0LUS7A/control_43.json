He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is wrong for not letting their best friend stay over after his wife died. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. Jake's wife died, he's really struggling, and he ended up showing up at the author's house in the middle of the night with his daughter. The author let the daughter stay but not Jake. Then Jake went back home, put the kid to sleep, and slept on the streets. The wife called the author an asshole, but the author thinks they're not in the wrong because they wanted to help Jake get through his grief.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are about grief, mental health, and the responsibilities of friends. When someone is in deep grief, especially after a traumatic event like a spouse's death, they might not be in a rational state. The author's reasoning is that by not letting Jake stay, they're pushing him to cope. But is that the right approach?\n\nOn one hand, the author might think that enabling Jake by letting him stay could prevent him from dealing with his emotions. But on the other hand, Jake was in a crisis, showing up in the middle of the night, and might not be in a position to handle things independently. Also, the fact that Jake later slept on the streets suggests that he didn't have any other support system, which could mean the author's refusal left him with no options. \n\nFriends' responsibilities can vary, but in a situation like this, where someone is at risk of self-harm (like taking sleeping pills to sleep), not offering support might be seen as neglectful. The author allowed the daughter to stay, which was good, but turning away Jake who was clearly in emotional distress could be seen as not being there when needed. \n\nAlso, the author's wife is upset, which adds another layer. Maybe the author thought they were doing the right thing by setting boundaries, but maybe they didn't consider Jake's immediate needs. Mental health crises often require immediate support, and pushing someone to \"get over it\" without providing help might not be effective or compassionate.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't offer the necessary support during a critical time, leading to Jake's worse situation. The answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
