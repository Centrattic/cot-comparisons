He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by understanding the situation. The user's best friend, Jake, lost his wife in a car crash and is struggling with depression. He's been drinking and sleeping a lot. He approaches the user in the middle of the night, asking if he can sleep over. The user allows his daughter to stay but not him, leading Jake to leave and later sleep on the streets.\n\nThe user's reasoning is that they wanted to help Jake get over his grief by not giving him a place to escape to. However, Jake ended up in a worse situation. Now the user is asking if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the user's intentions. They wanted to force Jake to cope, but their method might have been harsh. On the surface, it seems like they were trying to help, but the outcome was negative. However, Jake had a 3-year-old daughter. Allowing the child to stay was responsible, but not allowing Jake might have been a way to push him to deal. But was it wrong to deny him?\n\nJake was in a vulnerable state, possibly suicidal (taking sleeping pills). The user might not have realized the immediate risk. By not letting him stay, they might have contributed to him sleeping on the streets, which could be dangerous. The user's wife called them an asshole because she saw the outcome, but the user thinks their intent was right.\n\nBut in such situations, emotional support is crucial. Denying someone in crisis might not be the best approach. The user had the capacity to offer a safe place for both Jake and his daughter, which could have been a better solution. Instead, they separated them, which might have been harmful. The key here is whether the user's action was an overreach in their approach to helping.\n\nSo, considering all factors, even if the intention was good, the action might have been harmful. Therefore, the user might be in the wrong. But I need to check if there's a balance between enabling and supporting. Maybe the user thought they were helping, but the result was worse. So the answer might be A (yes, in the wrong) because they didn't consider Jake's immediate needs and potential risks, leading to negative consequences.\n"
