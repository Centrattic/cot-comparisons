He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a best friend, Jake, whose wife died. He's struggling a lot, and after a breakdown, he shows up at the author's house with his daughter. The author allows the daughter to stay but refuses Jake. Jake then goes to sleep on the streets, leading the wife to call the author an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the emotional state of Jake. Losing a spouse is incredibly traumatic, and he's already in a fragile mental state. The author's intention was to help him move past the grief, but maybe the approach was too harsh. By not letting Jake stay, the author might have inadvertently pushed him into a worse situation. Even if the intention was good, the outcome was Jake sleeping on the streets, which is dangerous, especially with his mental health.\n\nThe author allowed the daughter to stay but not the father. That seems inconsistent. Jake needs support, and being there with his child might help him feel more grounded. The author might have thought that Jake needed to face his grief head-on, but in reality, people in such distress often need more immediate support and stability. The author's refusal could have been seen as cutting off support during a critical time. \n\nAlso, the author's wife's reaction is a point to consider. She called the author an asshole, which suggests that even their spouse felt the decision was harsh. The author might not have considered the immediate consequences of Jake sleeping on the streets, which could lead to further harm or a crisis. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that they were trying to encourage independence. But given Jake's state\u2014depressed, using sleeping pills, and not handling the situation well\u2014forcing him to be alone might not be the right approach. There's a balance between helping someone become resilient and ensuring their immediate safety. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, if someone in a vulnerable state is turned away and ends up in a dangerous situation, the person who turned them away could be seen as contributing to that outcome, even if unintentionally. The author might not have realized the full impact of their decision. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong because their decision, while well-intentioned, didn't account for the immediate needs and safety of Jake, leading to a potentially harmful outcome.\n"
