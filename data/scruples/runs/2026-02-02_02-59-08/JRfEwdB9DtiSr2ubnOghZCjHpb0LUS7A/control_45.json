He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not allowing their best friend to stay after his wife died. The situation is pretty heavy. Jake is dealing with grief, depression, maybe substance abuse. The author allowed Jake's daughter to stay but not Jake himself, thinking he needs to get over it. The friend ended up sleeping on the street, which is bad, and the wife is upset.\n\nFirst, the author's reasoning: they wanted to help Jake move past his grief. But is pushing someone to \"get over it\" right when they're in such a fragile state ethical? Grief is a personal process, and forcing someone to face their environment alone might not be the best support. Also, the author allowed the child but not the parent. That could be neglecting the child's needs if the parent isn't there. But the parent might not be in a state to care for the child properly.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might have a point that the friend needs to start dealing with reality. But sleep on the streets? That's dangerous. The author didn't offer alternative help, like contacting other friends, family, or maybe professional help. Just turning him away without a plan could lead to worse outcomes. The friend's actions (sleeping pills, drinking) indicate he's not in a stable place. The author's wife is upset because the friend ended up homeless, which shows the decision had unintended negative consequences.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's intention to help was valid, but the execution was flawed. Maybe they should have allowed Jake to stay under supervision or connected him with resources. Turning him away without support might have been harmful. So, the answer might lean towards A (author is in the wrong) because they didn't consider the immediate safety and well-being of both Jake and his daughter, leading to Jake sleeping on the streets. But maybe there's nuance if they had other reasons. But generally, in such situations, providing support is crucial, even if it's tough love.\n"
