He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is being asked if they're at fault for not allowing their best friend to stay overnight after his wife died. The friend, Jake, is clearly struggling\u2014depressed, drinking, and even taking sleeping pills. He shows up unannounced with his daughter, and the author lets the daughter stay but not him. Then Jake ends up sleeping on the streets, and the author's wife is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Jake is grieving and in a fragile state. The author's intention was to help him move past his grief by not letting him avoid his house. But by not allowing Jake to stay, they might have pushed him to a breaking point. Even though the author didn't intend for Jake to sleep outside, the result was that he did. Was the author's action reasonable?\n\nBest friends usually have a level of trust where the author would expect Jake to come to them for support. However, the author's decision might have been too abrupt without considering Jake's immediate emotional state. Maybe there was a better way to handle it, like talking it over instead of a firm refusal. Also, the author allowed the daughter to stay, which is thoughtful, but the action towards Jake might have been harsh given the circumstances.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's approach was supportive. Grieving people often need more help, not to be pushed away. Even if the author thought they were helping Jake by forcing him to face his house, the method might have been too harsh. The author's wife's reaction suggests that the action was seen as insensitive. So, perhaps the author is in the wrong because they didn't provide the necessary support during a critical time, leading to negative consequences.\n"
