He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting their best friend stay over after his wife died. So, first, I need to understand the situation thoroughly.\n\nJake's wife died, and he's clearly struggling. He's depressed, drinking, and sleeping a lot. He told the author he takes sleeping pills to cope. Then, one night he shows up at the author's door with his daughter, asking to stay. The author allows the daughter but not him, saying he needs to get over it. Jake leaves angry, and later, he sleeps on the streets. The author's wife is upset with him, but the author thinks they're not in the wrong.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about empathy, support during grief, and the consequences of the author's decision. Grief can make people behave in unexpected ways, and Jake is in a very vulnerable state. The author's intention was to help him move on, but their action might have been counterproductive. By not letting Jake stay, they might have pushed him to a point where he didn't have a safe place to stay, leading him to sleep outside with his daughter. Even though the author allowed the daughter, Jake's emotional state might have made the separation dangerous.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might have felt they were encouraging independence, but given the circumstances, it's a delicate balance. The fact that Jake was taking sleeping pills and was in a state of depression suggests that he might be at risk for self-harm or negligence. The author's refusal could have inadvertently contributed to Jake's decision to sleep on the street, even if that wasn't the intention. The daughter's safety is also a concern here.\n\nThe ethical angle here is whether the author's approach was supportive enough. Grief counseling often emphasizes the need for a strong support network. By pushing Jake to handle it on his own, the author might have failed to provide the necessary support. Even if the intention was good, the outcome could be seen as harmful. The author might not have considered alternative solutions, like contacting other friends or family, or maybe involving professional help.\n\nSo, considering that Jake was in a crisis and the author's action led to him being homeless for the night, even if unintentionally, the author might be at fault for not handling the situation more compassionately. The wife's anger likely comes from the immediate harm caused. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
