He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who refused their best friend Jake from staying over was in the wrong. Jake's wife died recently, and he's struggling with depression and self-harm. He showed up at the author's house with his daughter, and the author let the daughter stay but not him. Then Jake went to sleep on the streets, and the author's wife is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the circumstances. Grief affects people differently, and Jake is clearly in a very vulnerable state. The author's intention was to help Jake move past his grief by not letting him avoid his home. However, Jake's actions (taking sleeping pills, now sleeping on the streets) suggest he's in a crisis. The author's wife is upset because they feel like they didn't help enough.\n\nThe key points here are: \n1. Jake's mental health is critical. His behavior indicates he might be a danger to himself.\n2. The author allowed the daughter to stay but not Jake. This might have left Jake without a safe place, leading to him going to the streets.\n3. The author's reasoning was to push Jake to face his environment, but pushing someone in severe depression to stay in a triggering place might not be helpful and could be harmful.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, even if the author's intention was good, the outcome was Jake being in a dangerous situation. When someone is in acute crisis, they might not have the capacity to make safe decisions. The author might have a moral obligation to ensure Jake's safety, even if it's about letting him stay temporarily while he gets help. \n\nHowever, the author didn't have a legal obligation, but morally, if they knew Jake was at risk (sleeping pills, not handling his house), perhaps they should have done more. Allowing both Jake and his daughter to stay could have provided a safer environment until he could get proper support. \n\nThe answer might depend on cultural expectations too. In some views, the author did their best, but in others, not providing a safe haven for a grieving friend and child is wrong. Since the result was Jake on the streets, the author might share some responsibility. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author's actions might be seen as not in the wrong because their intention was to help, but the outcome was harmful. However, the method might have been flawed. But the question is whether they are in the wrong. If the action led to harm despite good intentions, the answer could be A (yes, in the wrong) because they didn't consider the immediate risk. Alternatively, if the intention is what matters, maybe B. But given that Jake's well-being is at stake, the author's refusal might have been harmful, hence A.\n"
