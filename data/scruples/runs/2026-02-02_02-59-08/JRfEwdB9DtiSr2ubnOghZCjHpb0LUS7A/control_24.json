He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about their best friend Jake coming to their house after his wife died. The writer refused to let Jake stay, only allowing his daughter. Jake then went to sleep on the streets, leading to the wife being upset.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. Jake is grieving, dealing with depression, and his behavior is concerning (sleeping pills, drinking). The writer's intention was to help him get through the grief. But the method was to not let him stay, thinking he needs to face it. However, Jake ended up on the streets, which seems harmful.\n\nThe writer's reasoning is that by not letting him stay, they're pushing Jake to handle his grief. But is that the right approach? Grieving people in crisis might need support, not being forced to face triggers. The writer allowed the daughter, which is a good move, but refusing Jake might not have been the best. If Jake is in a state where he's suicidal or self-harming, pushing him away could be dangerous. The writer might not have considered Jake's mental state and instead of helping, they inadvertently caused him to isolate further.\n\nAlso, the wife's reaction suggests that the action was harsh. While the writer might have had good intentions, the outcome was negative. Jake sleeping on the streets is a bad result. The writer didn't offer any alternative support, like a hotel or connecting him with resources. So, the approach might be seen as unempathetic. The answer would likely be A, the author is in the wrong because they didn't provide necessary support and their action led to a harmful outcome.\n"
