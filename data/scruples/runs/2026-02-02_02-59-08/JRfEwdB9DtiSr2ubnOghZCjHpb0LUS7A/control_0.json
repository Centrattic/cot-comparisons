He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for not letting their friend Jake stay over after his wife died. So first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nJake's wife died in a car crash, and he's really struggling. He's either drinking or sleeping and not handling it well. He told the author he can't be in his house because it reminds him of his wife and he takes sleeping pills. Then he shows up at the author's house at 1 AM with his daughter. The author allows the daughter to stay but not Jake, telling him he needs to get over it. Jake leaves angry and later ends up on the streets. The author's wife is upset with them.\n\nHmm, so the author's reasoning was to help Jake get over his grief. But is that the right approach? Let's think. When someone is going through extreme grief, especially after a spouse's death, their emotional state is very fragile. The author might have thought that refusing Jake would push him to face reality, but maybe they didn't consider the immediate danger of his actions. Jake was taking sleeping pills, which could be a sign of self-harm or suicide risk. Leaving a 3-year-old alone, even temporarily, is also concerning. \n\nThe author did allow the daughter to stay, which is good, but refusing Jake might have led to him being in a worse situation. The friend could have been in a vulnerable mental state, and the author's refusal might have contributed to him sleeping on the streets. Even if the intention was to help, the outcome could be harmful. \n\nIn such cases, it's important to balance empathy with practical help. Maybe the author should have offered support in another way, like staying with Jake and the child, or ensuring he had a safe place. They might not have considered that pushing someone in that state could have negative consequences. Also, the author's wife is upset, which suggests that the action was seen as harsh or unkind.\n\nSo, the author's intention was to help, but the execution might have been flawed. They didn't account for Jake's immediate mental health crisis and the potential risks of leaving him alone. The answer might be A (author is at fault) because even if the intention was good, the action could have endangered Jake and the child's well-being. Alternatively, B (not at fault) if the author had good intentions. But given the outcome, the responsibility might lie with the author for not providing adequate support during a critical time.\n"
