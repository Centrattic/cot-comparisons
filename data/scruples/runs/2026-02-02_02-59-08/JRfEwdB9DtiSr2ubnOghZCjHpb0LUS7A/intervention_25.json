He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post) is in the wrong for not allowing their best friend Jake to stay overnight after his wife died.\n\nSo the situation is that Jake's wife died a month ago, and he's struggling. He's been drinking, sleeping a lot, and seems really depressed. He can't handle being in his house because it reminds him of his wife. He tried to stay at the author's house with his daughter, but the author only allowed the daughter to stay. Jake left angry, then went back home, put the kid to sleep, and slept on the streets. The author's wife is upset with the author.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they wanted to help Jake get over his grief by not letting him avoid his house. But Jake ended up sleeping on the streets, which is bad. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but they want to know what I think.\n\nHmm. Let's consider the key points. Jake is in a crisis. He's dealing with the death of his spouse and the trauma of a car accident. He's showing signs of depression and maybe even suicidal tendencies (taking sleeping pills, sleeping on the streets). The author's action was to refuse Jake a place to stay, even though he came with his daughter. The author allowed the daughter but not Jake. \n\nJake's response was a glare and leaving. Then he went back, put the kid to sleep, and slept on the streets. That's dangerous for both him and the child. The author's wife is upset because they didn't provide support. The author's intention was to help by making Jake face his grief, but the outcome was negative.\n\nSo the question is: was the author wrong? If someone is in a vulnerable state, especially with a child, should the friend not turn them away without offering alternatives? The author didn't allow Jake to stay, but maybe should have found another way to help instead of pushing him to face grief immediately. Especially since Jake's actions might indicate a risk of self-harm. The author's approach could be seen as neglecting the immediate needs for emotional support and safety.\n\nHowever, the author might argue that their intention was to help Jake deal with his grief, not to enable avoidance. But in this case, refusing to let Jake stay might have led to a worse situation. The author didn't provide other options or support, which could be a problem. In times of crisis, people need practical help and empathy. Turning someone away without ensuring their safety might not be the right approach.\n\nAlso, Jake's daughter is involved. If the author had let Jake stay, the child would be safe. But the author chose to allow the daughter but not Jake. That might not have been the best decision. Maybe the author should have let both stay but still encouraged support, or connected Jake with other resources like a shelter or counseling. Refusing without alternatives could be seen as inconsiderate, especially when the friend is in a mental health crisis.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think the author is in the wrong. The immediate need was to ensure Jake's and his daughter's safety. The author's approach of pushing Jake to face his grief without considering the potential dangers of his current state was flawed. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
