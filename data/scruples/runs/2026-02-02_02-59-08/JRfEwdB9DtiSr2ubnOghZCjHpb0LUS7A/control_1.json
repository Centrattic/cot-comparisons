He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting their best friend stay after his wife died. So, Jake, the friend, is really struggling. His wife passed away, he's depressed, drinking, and now he's at the author's door with his daughter. The author lets the kid stay but not Jake, thinking it's to help him move on. But Jake ended up sleeping on the streets, and the author's wife is upset with them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the emotional state of Jake. Grief can make people do really impulsive things. He's in a lot of pain, and maybe the author's decision to not let him stay was well-intentioned but maybe not the best approach. The author's reasoning is that Jake needs to get over it, but dealing with loss isn't that simple. Pushing someone to \"get over it\" might not be helpful, especially when they're in such a fragile state.\n\nJake brought his daughter with him, which shows he's trying to take care of her. The author allowed the child to stay but not Jake. That might have been a way to help but also cut off Jake, who might need support. If Jake felt he couldn't stay, maybe he didn't have another place to go. Sleeping on the streets is dangerous, especially for someone in a vulnerable mental state. The author didn't consider that refusing him might lead to Jake making a reckless decision.\n\nThe author's wife is upset because they feel like they're being blamed for Jake's actions. But the author's responsibility here might be more about how they handled the situation. Maybe instead of saying he can't stay, the author offered other support, like connecting him with resources, staying with him that night, or ensuring he had a safe place. The reaction of Jake taking the kid and leaving could have been avoided if the author had been more understanding and provided a different kind of help.\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning that keeping Jake from staying would help him move on is questionable. Grief is a process, and pushing someone to not stay might push them further into isolation or worse mental health. The author might have been trying to be tough love, but in reality, that approach can backfire when someone is in crisis.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author probably isn't in the wrong in terms of their intention, but their action might have been misguided. However, the outcome was that Jake ended up in a worse situation. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since Jake's actions led to him sleeping on the streets, maybe the author should have considered the potential consequences of refusing him. Even with good intentions, the result was harmful. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not providing the necessary support and for not thinking through the possible outcomes of their decision.\n"
