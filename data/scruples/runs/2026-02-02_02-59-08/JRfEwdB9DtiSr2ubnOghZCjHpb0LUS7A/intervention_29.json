He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for not letting their friend stay over after his wife died. The situation is pretty heavy\u2014Jake's dealing with a lot of grief, and he's not handling it well. He shows up with his daughter in the middle of the night, asking to stay. The author allows the daughter to stay but refuses Jake, thinking it's for his own good. Then Jake ends up sleeping on the streets, which the wife is upset about.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Grief can make people act unpredictably. Jake's depression and possible substance abuse are red flags. The author might be trying to help by pushing Jake to deal with his issues instead of avoiding them. But at the same time, turning away someone in crisis, even with good intentions, can have serious consequences. The author's wife is upset because Jake ended up on the streets, which is a bad outcome. \n\nOn one hand, the author's intention was to help Jake move past his grief. On the other, they might not have considered the immediate risks. Maybe there's a middle ground, like setting up a temporary arrangement with support, instead of a flat refusal. The author could have offered help in a different way, like staying with Jake temporarily while encouraging him to seek professional help. \n\nAlso, the fact that Jake's daughter was with him adds another layer. The author allowed the daughter to stay, which is good, but not letting the father in might have left him feeling abandoned. The author's decision might have been based on a desire for Jake to face his grief, but the method could be questioned. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might have an obligation as a friend to provide some level of support, even if it means being firm. However, they also need to consider their own family's safety and well-being. But in a crisis, sometimes people need immediate support, and refusing help can lead to worse outcomes. \n\nSo, while the author's intent was to help, the approach might have been misguided. The key is whether there was a better way to handle the situation. Since Jake ended up on the streets, it's possible the author's refusal directly contributed to that. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not finding a more supportive solution.\n"
