He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post) is in the wrong for not allowing their best friend Jake to stay overnight after his wife died.\n\nFirst, the situation: Jake is grieving, his wife died in a car crash. He's struggling with depression, using drinking and sleeping as coping mechanisms. He has a 3-year-old daughter. He went to the author's house in the middle of the night with his daughter, asking to stay. The author allowed the daughter but not Jake. Jake then left and later slept on the streets, leading the author's wife to call him a massive asshole.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they wanted Jake to \"get over it eventually,\" which implies they felt he needed to face his grief rather than avoid it. But Jake's actions\u2014taking sleeping pills, being in a mental state where he can't handle his house\u2014suggest he's in crisis. The author's decision might be seen as not providing necessary support during a vulnerable time. \n\nKey points to consider: \n1. Jake's mental state is severe enough that he's self-harming (sleeping pills) and avoiding his home, which triggers his grief. \n2. The author's action of allowing the daughter but not Jake might have left Jake without a safe place, leading him to sleep on the streets. \n3. The author's intention was to help Jake cope, but the method could be seen as dismissive of his immediate emotional needs. \n4. Grief is complex; forcing someone to confront it immediately might not be helpful and could be harmful. \n5. The author's wife's reaction indicates that others might see the action as cruel, especially given the consequence of Jake being out on the streets with a young child.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that they were trying to push Jake to deal with his grief. However, the outcome was negative, and the approach could be considered unempathetic. The line between helping someone and pushing them into a crisis is thin here. The author might not have considered the immediate safety and emotional state of Jake, leading to a harmful result. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author had intentions of helping, the action of refusing Jake's stay without considering the immediate consequences (like him sleeping outside) could be seen as wrong. The right approach would be to support Jake in a way that ensures his and his daughter's safety, perhaps by finding another solution instead of a blanket refusal.\n"
