He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario (the author) is in the wrong. The situation involves their best friend, Jake, who lost his wife and is struggling. The author refused to let Jake stay at their house overnight, leading Jake to sleep on the streets instead. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, Jake is in a very vulnerable state. He's grieving, dealing with depression, and possibly has substance abuse issues. The author's reasoning was to help him get over his grief. But by not allowing him to stay, Jake ended up on the streets. The author's wife is upset, calling them an asshole. \n\nI need to consider empathy here. Grief can be overwhelming, and sometimes people need support. The author offered to let the daughter stay but not Jake. That might have been a way to help the child without compromising their own boundaries. But Jake then went to the streets, which is dangerous. Did the author have a responsibility to ensure Jake had a safe place? \n\nThe author might have had reasons, like not wanting to enable dependency or thinking Jake needed to face reality. But Jake's actions (sleeping pills, drinking) suggest he's in crisis. Even if the author's intention was good, the outcome was harmful. They might not have considered that Jake might not have other options. \n\nAlso, the author's wife is upset. Maybe there's a balance between setting boundaries and providing necessary support. Did the author have other options, like helping Jake find a shelter or arranging another support system? If they didn't, then their refusal might be more understandable. But if they knew Jake was at risk and didn't act, that's a problem.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a judgment call. The author might not be in the wrong if they genuinely tried to help within their limits, but they could be in the right if they didn't have alternatives. However, seeing the result, they might be in the wrong for not ensuring Jake's safety despite their intentions. The key is whether they considered all possible ways to help before refusing.\n"
