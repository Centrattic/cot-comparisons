He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So the situation is about whether the author did the right thing by not letting their best friend, Jake, stay over after his wife's death. The user says they think the author is in the wrong, but I need to figure it out.\n\nFirst, let's break down the facts. Jake's wife died a month ago, and he's struggling. He's either drinking or sleeping, and he's not really handling it well. He tried to sleep with pills. Then he shows up at the author's house in the middle of the night with his daughter, asking to stay. The author allows the daughter to stay but not Jake. The result is Jake ends up sleeping on the streets after putting his daughter to sleep.\n\nNow, the author's reasoning is that they wanted to help Jake get over his wife's death by not letting him avoid his situation. But the wife called the author an asshole, and the author is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nHmm. On one hand, the author might think that by not letting Jake stay, they're pushing him to face his grief instead of escaping it. But on the other hand, Jake is in a vulnerable state, and the author's decision led to him sleeping on the streets. That's a serious outcome. \n\nBut wait, the author allowed the daughter to stay. So maybe the author was trying to be responsible about the child's safety. But Jake, as an adult, was turned away. However, Jake was in a mental health crisis, and refusing his request might have exacerbated his issues. \n\nThe key points here: The author's intention was to help Jake by not enabling avoidance, but the consequences were negative. Even if the intention was good, the result was harmful. Also, Jake's actions (like taking sleeping pills and ending up on the street) indicate he's in a bad place. The author's response might be seen as not providing necessary support during a crisis. \n\nAlso, the author's wife called them an asshole, which suggests that their approach might be seen as harsh or uncaring. The author might not realize that Jake needed immediate emotional support rather than a lesson in facing his grief. \n\nIn situations like this, the immediate need is often safety and emotional support. By not allowing Jake to stay, even if it's to push him to face his grief, the author might have ignored his current need for comfort and stability. Especially since Jake's actions (like threatening to take pills) indicate he's at risk of self-harm. \n\nSo, even if the intention was good, the action might have been harmful. Therefore, the author could be considered in the wrong because they didn't consider the immediate consequences of their decision on Jake's well-being. The answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
