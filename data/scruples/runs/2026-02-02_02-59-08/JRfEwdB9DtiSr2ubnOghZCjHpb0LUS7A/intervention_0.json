He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's best friend, Jake, lost his wife and is really struggling. He's been drinking, sleeping a lot, and not handling it well. He ended up at the author's house asking to sleep over, but the author only allowed his daughter to stay, not him. Then Jake left and went to sleep on the streets, and the author's wife is upset with them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the emotions here. Grief is a powerful thing. Jake is in a lot of pain, and maybe he felt desperate. The author's intention was to help him get over the loss by not giving in to his request to stay, thinking that he needs to face his grief. But by not allowing Jake to stay, the author might have pushed him to a point where he felt even more alone or desperate, leading him to sleep on the streets. That seems really harsh.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might have thought they were helping by not enabling Jake's avoidance. But Jake is his best friend, and in a crisis, the usual social rules about boundaries might not apply. The author did let the daughter stay, which is good, but leaving Jake alone could have been dangerous, especially since he was considering taking sleeping pills and was in a fragile mental state. There might have been a risk of self-harm or something worse if they didn't let him stay.\n\nThe author's wife called them a \"massive asshole,\" which suggests that their action was seen as cold-hearted. Even if the intention was good, the outcome was that Jake ended up in a worse situation. Maybe there was a better way to handle it, like offering support while also setting boundaries. For example, staying up with Jake to talk, or getting help from a professional, instead of just sending him away.\n\nAlso, the fact that Jake was holding himself together for his daughter shows that he's trying, but he's in a really tough place. The author might have underestimated how deep Jake's grief was. Not allowing him to stay could have made him feel abandoned when he needed support the most. Even if it's the author's house, in a crisis situation, friends often step up with more help than usual.\n\nSo, considering all that, even if the author had good intentions, the result of their action was harmful. The author might have been wrong in not providing the necessary support during such a critical time. It's possible that the author should have found a way to help Jake without compromising their own space, maybe by staying up with him, contacting other friends, or getting him professional help. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong here.\n"
