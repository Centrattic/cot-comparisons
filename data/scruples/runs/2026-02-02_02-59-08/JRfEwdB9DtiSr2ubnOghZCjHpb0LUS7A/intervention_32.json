He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the question) is in the wrong. The situation is about a best friend, Jake, whose wife died recently. He's struggling with depression and substance abuse. He shows up at the author's house in the middle of the night with his daughter, asking to stay. The author allows the daughter to stay but not Jake, telling him he has to get over it. Jake then sleeps on the streets. The author's wife is upset, but the author thinks they're not in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the emotional state of Jake. He's grieving, which is a huge stressor. The author's intention was to help him move past his grief, but maybe not considering the immediate need for support. Jake's actions (drinking, sleeping pills) suggest he's in crisis. Allowing him to sleep on the streets could be dangerous, especially after taking pills. \n\nThe author's decision to let the daughter stay but not Jake seems harsh. Even if the intention was to push Jake to cope, leaving him on the streets without support might not be the best approach. The author could have offered help in a different way, like staying with him to ensure he's safe, rather than cutting him off. \n\nAlso, being a best friend, the author might have a responsibility to provide support during such a crisis. The author's wife called them an asshole, which might indicate a lack of empathy in the situation. The author should consider that Jake's mental health is critical right now, and pushing him away without alternatives could exacerbate the problem. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel they're trying to help Jake become independent. However, in a mental health crisis, immediate safety is the priority. The author could have offered a compromise, like letting Jake stay but setting boundaries, or arranging for another form of help if they were uncomfortable hosting. \n\nSo, the author's actions led to Jake sleeping on the streets after a traumatic event, which could be seen as neglecting their responsibility as a friend. Therefore, the answer is likely A (author is in the wrong).\n"
