He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post) is in the wrong for not letting their best friend, Jake, crash at their house after his wife died. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. Jake's wife died recently, and he's struggling a lot\u2014depression, drinking, taking sleeping pills. His daughter is with him. He showed up at the author's house in the middle of the night, asking to stay. The author said the daughter could stay but not Jake. Jake left, went home, put the kid to sleep, and then slept on the streets. The wife is upset with the author, but the author thinks they're not in the wrong because they wanted to help Jake get through his grief.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Jake is in a vulnerable state, dealing with grief, and the author made a decision that led to him sleeping on the streets. The author's intention was to help him move past the loss, but did they handle it the right way?\n\nI need to consider empathy here. Grief is a complex emotion, and people deal with it differently. Jake's actions show he's not in a stable mental state\u2014using sleeping pills, being depressed, and not handling the environment that reminds him of his wife. The author's response was to allow the daughter but not Jake, which might have been a way to set boundaries. But maybe the author could have done more to support Jake without being pushy. \n\nThe problem is, by not letting Jake stay, the author might have left Jake in a dangerous situation. Sleeping on the streets could be unsafe, especially if he's under the influence of pills. Even if the intention was to help, the outcome was harmful. The author didn't consider alternative solutions, like contacting other friends or maybe local shelters. \n\nAlso, the author's wife was upset, which suggests that their decision might have been too harsh. Emotional support during grief is crucial. Maybe the author should have been more flexible, understanding that Jake's behavior is a result of his trauma. \n\nBut then again, the author isn't responsible for providing long-term support. They might have their own limits and boundaries. However, refusing Jake completely without offering any other options could be seen as inconsiderate. The author's approach might have been well-intentioned but executed poorly. \n\nSo, balancing the intention with the outcome: the author wanted to help but their method caused harm. In such sensitive situations, the approach should ensure safety and support. The author's strict stance without alternatives might be seen as wrong because they didn't consider the immediate risk to Jake's well-being. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they didn't provide necessary support despite the intention to help.\n"
