He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong for not letting their best friend stay at their house after his wife died. So, the situation is that Jake, the friend, is struggling with depression and grief. He showed up unannounced with his daughter at the author's house and asked to stay. The author allowed the daughter but not Jake, telling him he needs to get over it. Then Jake ended up sleeping on the streets, and the author's wife is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They might think they're helping Jake by pushing him to face his grief instead of avoiding it. They might believe that letting him stay would make him avoid dealing with his emotions. But then again, Jake was in a fragile state and ended up sleeping outside, which is dangerous. The author's intention was good, but the outcome was bad.\n\nNow, looking at Jake's side. He's in a lot of pain, dealing with loss, and maybe he's not thinking clearly. He brought his daughter, who's vulnerable too. The author's decision might have been harsh without considering the immediate safety of both Jake and his daughter. Even if the author thought Jake needed to handle it, maybe they should have offered a different solution, like staying temporarily but with conditions.\n\nThe wife's reaction is also a factor. She called the author a massive asshole, indicating she thinks they were wrong. The author's response is that they didn't want to let Jake stay to help him move past his grief, but maybe they didn't consider alternative ways to support him without leaving him homeless.\n\nI should also consider societal norms. When someone is in crisis, friends often provide support, even if it's temporary. The author might have had the means and opportunity to help, even if it wasn't the best long-term solution. Letting someone sleep on the streets isn't safe, so the author's decision led to a harmful outcome.\n\nAnother angle: the author allowed the daughter but not Jake. That's a bit inconsistent. Maybe the daughter needed care, so the author was trying to help her, but Jake was struggling too. Perhaps the author should have found a way to accommodate both, even if it was just for the night.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might not have an obligation, but in a close friendship, there's an expectation of support. The author's refusal could be seen as a failure to support a friend in need, especially when the alternative was sleeping outdoors. Even if their reasoning was to help Jake face his grief, safety is a priority. There's a balance between encouraging resilience and ensuring immediate well-being.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author's intention was to help Jake move past his grief, but the action might have been too harsh without considering the immediate consequences. The outcome was harmful, leading to Jake sleeping on the streets. While the author's reasoning isn't entirely wrong, the way they handled the situation could be seen as inconsiderate of Jake's immediate needs and safety. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not allowing Jake to stay, even if their intention was good.\n"
