He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting their best friend stay over after his wife died. So, the situation is that Jake is really struggling with depression and grief, even going as far as taking sleeping pills. He shows up at the author's house with his daughter, and the author allows the daughter to stay but not Jake. Then Jake ends up sleeping on the streets.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the emotional state of Jake. He's in deep grief, and the author's refusal might have pushed him to make a harmful decision. The author's intention was to help Jake get over his wife's death, but their approach might have been counterproductive. Allowing the daughter to stay but not Jake could be seen as a lack of support. Also, the fact that the author's wife is upset adds another layer. \n\nThe key points here are the author's responsibility as a friend and the potential consequences of their actions. Even if the author's intention was good, the result was Jake being in a dangerous situation. The author might not have considered the immediate need for emotional support versus their long-term goal. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue they were trying to encourage Jake to cope independently. But in cases of severe depression and suicidal tendencies, immediate support is crucial. The author's refusal might have been a mistake in not providing the necessary support during a crisis. \n\nSo, considering the outcome and the context, the author's actions might have contributed to Jake's decision to sleep on the streets, which could be dangerous. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
