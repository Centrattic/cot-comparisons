He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting their best friend, Jake, crash at their house after his wife's death. Let's break down the details.\n\nFirst, Jake's wife died in a car crash a month ago. He's handling it poorly, being depressed, drinking, sleeping a lot. His daughter is 3, and he's not neglecting her but barely holding it together. Then, Jake tells the author he can't be in his house anymore and takes sleeping pills. At 1 AM, he shows up at their door with his daughter, asking to stay. The author allows the daughter but not Jake. Jake leaves in anger and later sleeps on the streets. The wife calls the author an asshole, but the author thinks they're not.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider the context. The author's intention was to help Jake get through his grief, but their action of not letting him in might have pushed him to sleep outside. Jake was in a vulnerable state, possibly suicidal, given the sleeping pills. The author's decision might have been based on wanting to help him cope, but the immediate effect was negative. \n\nBut was the author wrong? Maybe. Even if they meant well, refusing shelter could have been harmful. The author allowed the daughter but not Jake, which might have separated a parent from their child. Also, the author's wife is upset. On the other hand, the author might have thought that Jake needed to face reality and not isolate, but sleeping on the streets is dangerous. \n\nAnother angle: in a crisis, friends often step in. The author could have set boundaries but maybe should have found another way to help. Maybe they could have allowed Jake to stay temporarily while encouraging him to seek professional help. The author's action might have been harsh, especially considering Jake's mental state. \n\nBut the author isn't a professional, and sometimes people can't handle others' grief. However, the result was Jake sleeping outside, which could be life-threatening. The author might have the right to set their home's limits, but given the circumstances, not offering help could be seen as wrong. \n\nI think there's a balance here. The author might not be in the wrong for saying no, but they could be wrong for not providing alternative support. However, the question is about being in the wrong. In terms of social norms, offering shelter to a grieving friend is common, especially when there's a child involved. The author's refusal, even with good intentions, might have been inconsiderate given the situation. So the answer might be A (author is wrong). But I need to be careful. Alternatively, maybe the author isn't wrong because they were trying to help Jake in their own way. \n\nWait, Jake was at their door with his daughter. The author allowed the daughter but not Jake. That's a key point. If the author allowed the child but not the father, maybe that's contributing to the problem. Jake might need support, and separating him from his daughter could be harmful. The author's action of allowing the child but not the father might have caused Jake to leave and then sleep outside. So the author's approach might not have been the best, but is that making them wrong?\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, sometimes people need to set boundaries for their own homes. But in a crisis, maybe the author should have been more flexible. The key is whether refusing shelter was the right choice. Since Jake was in a mental health crisis, the author's refusal could be seen as not providing necessary support, thus making them at fault. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
