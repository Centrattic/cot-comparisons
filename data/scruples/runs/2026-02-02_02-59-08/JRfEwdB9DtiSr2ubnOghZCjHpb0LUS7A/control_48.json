He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting their friend Jake stay over after his wife died. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. Jake is clearly grieving and struggling, even to the point of using sleeping pills. He showed up at their door with his daughter, and the author allowed the child but not him. Then Jake ended up on the streets, which is bad. The wife is upset with the author.\n\nThe key points here: The author's intention was to help Jake get through his grief, but the action of not letting him stay might have unintended consequences. Allowing Jake to stay might have been a better way to support him, especially since he's in a vulnerable state. \n\nThere's a balance between setting boundaries and providing support. Even if the author wanted to push Jake to cope, refusing him when he's in such a crisis could be seen as harsh. Jake's actions (sleeping pills, being on the streets) suggest he's not handling it well, so the author's refusal might have been a mistake. The wife's reaction indicates that the author's decision had negative outcomes. \n\nAlso, considering Jake has a young child, the author's decision might have left Jake without a safe place, which is a significant issue. While the author might have good intentions, the outcome was harmful. So, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because not allowing Jake to stay could be seen as a failure to support a grieving friend adequately.\n"
