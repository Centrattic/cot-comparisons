He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post (the author) is in the wrong. The situation is that their best friend Jake lost his wife, and after a breakdown, he showed up at the author's house with his daughter. The author allowed the daughter to stay but refused Jake, telling him he has to get over it. Jake then slept on the streets. The author's wife is upset, but the author thinks they're not in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Jake is grieving, which is a very intense time. He's struggling with depression, drinking, and sleeping pills. When he came to the author's house, he was in a vulnerable state. The author's intention was to help him move past his grief by not letting him take the easy way out, but the result was that Jake ended up on the streets. \n\nThe key points here are: Is it reasonable to expect someone in such a state to cope without support? The author's action might be seen as not providing necessary support. Even if the intention was good, the outcome was harmful. Allowing Jake to stay, even temporarily, could have prevented him from resorting to sleeping on the streets. The author's wife called them an asshole, which suggests that maybe the action was perceived as harsh. \n\nAlso, the fact that Jake's daughter was with him adds another layer. The author allowed the child to stay but not the father, which might be seen as splitting the family, even if temporarily. Jake was already in a fragile mental state, and being denied shelter could exacerbate his condition. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might have felt that enabling Jake to avoid his home was counterproductive. But in moments of crisis, people might need immediate support, even if it's not the long-term solution. The author's approach might be too rigid, not considering the immediate emotional needs versus the long-term goal.\n\nSo, considering all that, even though the author had good intentions, the action of refusing to let Jake stay could have contributed to a dangerous situation. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't provide necessary support during a critical time, leading to a negative outcome. Answer A.\n"
