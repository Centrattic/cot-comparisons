He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Ask Me Anything (AMA) is in the wrong for not allowing his best friend, Jake, to crash at his house after Jake's wife died. The situation is pretty intense. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Jake is dealing with a major loss, and he's in a really vulnerable state. He's struggling, becoming depressed, and turning to drinking or sleeping. When he shows up at the author's door with his daughter, he's in a bad place\u2014maybe even considering suicide with sleeping pills. The author offers to let the daughter stay but refuses Jake. Then Jake ends up sleeping on the streets, which caused his wife to call the author an asshole.\n\nThe question is whether the author was wrong. Let's break it down. On one hand, the author's intention was to help Jake move past his grief. Maybe they thought that by not letting him stay, Jake would have to face his situation. But on the other hand, refusing someone in such a dire emotional and mental state, especially when they're with a child, could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nI should consider the possible consequences. By not letting Jake stay, he went to sleep on the streets, which is dangerous and not safe for him or his daughter. Even though the daughter was put to sleep, Jake being on the streets could lead to further issues. The author's decision might have been based on a desire to help, but the outcome was harmful. \n\nAlso, the author's wife is upset, calling him an asshole, which suggests that maybe their approach wasn't the best. Emotional support in times of grief often requires being there for the person, even if it's just to provide a safe space. The author's refusal might have been a mistake in not recognizing the immediate need for support, even if it's just temporary. \n\nBut there's also the argument that the author might have been trying to encourage Jake to handle it on his own. However, in cases of severe depression and suicidal thoughts, isolation can be dangerous. The author's decision to not offer support could be seen as lacking empathy in a critical moment. \n\nSo, weighing intentions against the outcome, the author's actions might have been well-intentioned, but the result was harmful. In such delicate situations, the immediate need for emotional and physical safety might override any long-term goals. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not providing a safe haven when Jake was in such a vulnerable state.\n"
