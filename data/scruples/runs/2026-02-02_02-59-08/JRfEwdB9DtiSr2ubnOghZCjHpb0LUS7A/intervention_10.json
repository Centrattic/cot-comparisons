He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. Let me try to break this down. \n\nThe situation is that Jake's wife died recently, and he's struggling with grief. He's been drinking, depressed, and now he shows up at the author's house in the middle of the night with his daughter, asking to stay. The author allows the daughter to stay but not Jake. Jake gets angry and leaves, then later ends up sleeping on the streets after putting his daughter to sleep.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they wanted to help Jake get over his grief by not letting him avoid his problems. But the wife is upset, calling the author an asshole. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to confirm.\n\nHmm. Grief is complicated. When someone is in severe distress, they might need immediate support. Jake was in a crisis, and showing up in the middle of the night suggests he felt desperate. The author's response was to deny him shelter, which led him to sleep on the streets. That seems harsh, especially with a three-year-old involved. Even if the author's intention was to help Jake confront his grief, the method might not be appropriate. Denying someone in crisis can lead to worse outcomes. The author might not have considered the immediate safety and well-being of Jake and his daughter. Maybe a better approach would have been to offer support while also ensuring they were safe. \n\nBut the author did let the daughter stay, which shows some empathy. However, leaving Jake to sleep outside could be dangerous. The author's action might have been well-intentioned but lacked understanding of Jake's mental state. So, maybe the author is in the wrong because they didn't provide the necessary support during a critical time. Answering A.\n"
