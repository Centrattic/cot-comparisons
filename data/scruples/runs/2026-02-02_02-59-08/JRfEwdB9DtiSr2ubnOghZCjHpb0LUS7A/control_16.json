He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting their friend stay over after his wife died. The friend, Jake, is clearly in a bad state, dealing with depression and possibly suicidal thoughts. He showed up unannounced at 1 AM with his daughter. The author allowed the daughter to stay but not Jake, thinking it would push him to cope. But Jake went to sleep on the streets, and the author's wife is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider Jake's mental health. When someone is in deep grief and possibly contemplating self-harm, their actions can be impulsive. The author might not have realized the severity of Jake's situation. By not letting him stay, they might have inadvertently contributed to his decision to sleep outside, which is dangerous. Even if the intention was to help him move on, maybe the approach was too harsh without considering his current mental state.\n\nAlso, the author allowed the daughter to stay but not Jake. That's a good move to protect the child, but Jake's need for support is critical. Maybe the author should have found another way to support both Jake and his daughter, like contacting other friends or family, or even suggesting professional help. Instead of a strict \"you must cope now\" approach, which might not be feasible given his emotional state.\n\nThe wife's reaction is also a point. She called the author a massive asshole, indicating that the decision was seen as cruel. The author's intention was to help, but the outcome was Jake being on the streets. That's a bad result regardless of intent. The author might not have considered all possible consequences here. Maybe there's a balance between pushing someone to heal and providing immediate support.\n\nIn mental health scenarios, the priority is safety. If someone is considering self-harm, they need immediate support. The author might not have assessed Jake's risk level. Even if the author thought Jake needed to get over it, Jake's actions showed he wasn't in a place where he could handle being alone. The author's refusal might have been a contributing factor to Jake's decision to sleep outside, which could have been prevented with a different approach.\n\nSo, while the intention was to help, the author's action didn't account for the immediate mental health crisis Jake was in. The correct approach would be to ensure his safety first, perhaps by staying with him, getting professional help, or finding another support system. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't prioritize Jake's immediate well-being despite the intention to help him long-term.\n"
