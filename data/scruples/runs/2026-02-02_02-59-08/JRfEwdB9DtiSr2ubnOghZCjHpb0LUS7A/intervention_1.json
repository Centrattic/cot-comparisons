He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is wrong for not letting his best friend stay overnight after the friend's wife died.\n\nFirst, the situation: Jake's wife died, he's struggling, and he shows up at the author's house with his daughter. The author allows the daughter to stay but not Jake. Jake then goes to sleep on the streets, which the wife found out and the author says it wasn't their intention to send him there.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about empathy and practicality. Jake is in a severe emotional crisis. The author's intention was to help him move past the grief, but the method might be harsh. By not allowing Jake to stay, the author might have inadvertently pushed him into a worse situation. Even if the author meant well, refusing shelter to someone in such a vulnerable state could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nAlso, the author allowed the daughter to stay, which is good, but not letting Jake in could be hurtful. The friend is in a fragile state, mixing depression and maybe suicidal thoughts (he mentioned sleep pills). The author might not have considered the immediate emotional needs versus the long-term goal. \n\nIn such cases, social support is crucial. The author's action, while intended to be a lesson, might have been counterproductive. The friend's reaction of a \"dirtiest glare\" and then going to sleep on the streets suggests he felt rejected. The wife's reaction is also a point\u2014calling the author a massive asshole implies that others see the action as harsh.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel they're trying to help Jake become independent again. But in a crisis, sometimes people need more support, not push to be self-reliant. The line between helping and being unhelpful can be thin here. \n\nI think the author is in the wrong because refusing shelter to a grieving friend, especially when he was clearly in a bad state, could be seen as not being there when he needed support. The intention was good, but the action may have been inconsiderate of Jake's immediate emotional needs. So, answer A.\n"
