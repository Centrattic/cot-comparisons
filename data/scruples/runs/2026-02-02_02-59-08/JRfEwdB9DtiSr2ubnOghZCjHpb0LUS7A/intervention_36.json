He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's best friend, Jake, lost his wife and is struggling. He showed up at the author's house with his daughter in the middle of the night, asking to stay. The author allowed the daughter to stay but not Jake. Then Jake ended up sleeping on the streets, and the author's wife is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Grief can be really overwhelming, and Jake seems to be in a very fragile state. The author's intention was to help Jake by not letting him stay, thinking he needs to get over the loss. But the result was that Jake ended up on the streets, which is dangerous and not a safe place for someone in that emotional state. \n\nOn one hand, the author might think they're encouraging Jake to be independent, but when someone is in deep depression and considering self-harm (like taking sleeping pills), the priority should be their safety. The author could have offered a safer alternative, like letting Jake stay but setting boundaries, or at least ensuring he has a safe place to stay instead of being left alone. \n\nAlso, the author allowed the daughter to stay but not the father. That might be a problem because separating parent and child, especially in such a vulnerable time, could add to the stress. The author might not have considered the impact of that decision on both Jake and his daughter. \n\nThe fact that the author's wife is upset and the author is now being called a massive asshole suggests that the action was seen as harsh and possibly harmful. The key issue here is whether the author's action, while intended to be helpful, actually caused harm. \n\nIn situations where someone is in crisis, it's often important to prioritize immediate safety over long-term coping. So maybe the author's approach was too rigid, and a more compassionate response, even if it meant allowing Jake to stay temporarily, might have been better. \n\nHowever, it's also possible that the author was trying to be strong to help Jake, not realizing the consequences. But given the outcome (sleeping on the streets), the author's decision might have contributed to that. \n\nSo, putting it all together, I think the author is in the wrong because they didn't consider the potential harm of their decision and didn't provide a safe alternative for someone in a vulnerable state.\n"
