He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a best friend, Jake, whose wife died. He's struggling, and the author (AITA) refused to let him stay over, only allowing his daughter. Then Jake ended up on the streets.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author's reasoning was that Jake needs to get over his grief. But Jake was in a very vulnerable state, using sleeping pills, and showed up unannounced. The author allowed the daughter but not Jake. The wife called the author a massive asshole, but he doesn't think he was wrong.\n\nI think about grief and how people handle it differently. Jake's actions\u2014drinking, sleeping pills, avoiding his house\u2014show he's in deep depression. The author's intention was to help him move on, but maybe not considering his immediate mental health crisis. Refusing him shelter when he's in such a state could have serious consequences. Even if the author had good intentions, forcing someone in that condition to be alone might not be the best support. \n\nAlso, the author allowed the daughter but not Jake. So the daughter was safe, but Jake went to the streets. The author might not have considered the risk Jake could take in his state. Maybe they should have offered temporary housing for both or sought professional help. The author's approach might have been too rigid, not accounting for Jake's emotional state. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might have been trying to push Jake to heal. But in crisis situations, immediate support is crucial. The author's action led to Jake being homeless for a night, which could be seen as neglecting his well-being. The wife's reaction was strong, which suggests there's a moral judgment here. \n\nConsidering all that, the author's intention wasn't malicious, but the outcome was harmful. They might have acted without considering the immediate needs and risks involved. So, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
