He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for not letting their best friend, Jake, stay over after his wife's death.\n\nFirst, the situation: Jake is dealing with a recent loss, is emotionally and physically struggling, and is showing signs of depression. He ends up showing up at the author's house at 1 AM with his daughter. The author allows the daughter to stay but not Jake. The next day, Jake ends up sleeping on the streets, which upsets the author's wife.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they wanted to help Jake get over his grief by not letting him avoid his house. However, the consequence was that Jake slept outside, which seems dangerous and neglectful, especially with a young child. \n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, they tried to be supportive by letting the daughter stay but not Jake. Their intention was to encourage Jake to face his grief. But the method might have been flawed. If someone is in a severe mental health crisis, turning them away could lead to harmful outcomes. The author might not have considered alternative solutions, like contacting another friend, a family member, or a crisis hotline. Also, Jake's actions of taking sleeping pills are concerning, indicating possible suicidal thoughts. The author's response didn't address that immediate need.\n\nThe author's wife criticized them, which suggests there's a perspective that their action was harsh. The author might have failed to provide adequate support given the circumstances. Even if the intention was good, the outcome was negative, which could imply that the approach was wrong. \n\nBut then again, the author might have felt that allowing Jake to stay would enable avoidance behavior. However, in such critical situations, immediate support is crucial. The author's decision could be seen as neglecting the urgency of Jake's mental health crisis.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't account for the severity of Jake's state and didn't provide sufficient support beyond just the daughter. They could have looked for other resources or offered a different kind of help instead of denying Jake shelter. The result was Jake sleeping outside, which is a dangerous situation, especially with a young child left behind. Therefore, the answer is likely A.\n"
