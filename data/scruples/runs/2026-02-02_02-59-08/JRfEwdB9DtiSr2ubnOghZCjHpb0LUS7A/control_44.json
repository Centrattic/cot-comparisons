He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong. The situation is about their best friend Jake, whose wife died. Jake is really struggling, and after a mental health crisis, he shows up at their house with his daughter. The author says they let the daughter stay but not Jake, which led to Jake sleeping on the streets.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Grief is a powerful emotion, and Jake is going through a traumatic time. The author's intention was to help him move past his grief by not allowing him to stay. But Jake's actions\u2014taking sleeping pills and then going to the streets\u2014suggest he's in a bad place. The author's wife is upset, calling them an asshole, but the author thinks their actions were for Jake's good.\n\nIs there a balance between helping a friend and being too rigid? The author's decision might be seen as not providing necessary support. Even if the intention was good, not allowing Jake to stay could have left him in a vulnerable state. Jake might have been in a crisis, and the author's refusal could be seen as not being there for a friend in need. The daughter's safety is a concern, but Jake's mental health is also critical. The author allowed the daughter to stay, which is responsible, but not accommodating Jake's emotional needs might have been unkind. Maybe the author could have found a middle ground, like letting Jake stay for a night while setting boundaries. The key is whether the author's actions, though well-intentioned, caused harm. The answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because they didn't consider the immediate emotional needs and pushed Jake away when he needed support the most.\n"
