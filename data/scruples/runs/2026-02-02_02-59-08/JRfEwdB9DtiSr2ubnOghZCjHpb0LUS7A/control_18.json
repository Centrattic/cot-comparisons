He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author's best friend, Jake, lost his wife in a car crash. He's struggling a lot\u2014depressed, drinking, sleeping a lot. He has a 3-year-old daughter. The author and his wife have been trying to support him. Then one night, Jake shows up at their door with his daughter, asking if they can sleep over because he can't handle his house. The author says the daughter can stay, but Jake can't because he needs to eventually get over his grief. Jake leaves angry. Later, the author finds out Jake went home, put the kid to sleep, then slept on the streets. The author's wife is upset, but the author thinks he's not in the wrong because he wanted to help Jake move past his grief.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are about the author's decision to allow the daughter but not Jake. The author's reasoning is that Jake needs to deal with his emotions and not avoid his home. But Jake is in a very fragile state, using sleeping pills, and possibly suicidal thoughts (since he took sleeping pills to sleep). The author's reaction might be seen as not providing adequate support during a crisis.\n\nFirst, I should consider Jake's mental state. If he's threatening self-harm or is in a severe depression, the author's responsibility might be higher. Even though the author didn't mean to leave Jake on the streets, by not letting Jake stay, he might have contributed to Jake's decision to sleep outside. The author allowed the daughter but not Jake, which could be seen as not understanding Jake's need for support.\n\nAlso, Jake's actions of putting his daughter to sleep and then going to the streets might indicate he's overwhelmed and in crisis. The author's approach was to push Jake to face his grief, but in a situation where someone is in acute distress, sometimes the immediate need is to ensure their safety rather than focusing on long-term coping strategies.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that he was trying to encourage Jake to handle his grief, not avoid it. But maybe the author failed to recognize that Jake needed more immediate help and emotional support rather than a lesson in resilience.\n\nAnother angle: the author is a friend, not a professional. It's possible that the author didn't have the resources or training to handle a friend's suicidal behavior. However, Jake's actions (taking sleeping pills) might be a red flag for suicide risk, which the author should have taken more seriously. The author might have a responsibility to ensure Jake's safety, even if it's not their role as a friend. Sleeping on the streets after such a situation could be dangerous, and the author's decision not to let Jake stay might have left him vulnerable.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author might be seen as not providing necessary support during a critical time. Jake was in a mental health crisis, and the author's refusal could have worsened the situation. Even if the intention was to help, the outcome was harmful. The author should have considered alternative solutions, like contacting other friends or family, a support group, or even emergency services if Jake was at risk.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's decision, while perhaps well-intentioned, might not have been the right approach given the circumstances. The immediate need for safety and support seems more important than pushing someone to face their grief when they're not in a stable state. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
