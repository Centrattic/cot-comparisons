He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about their best friend, Jake, who lost his wife and is struggling. The author didn't allow Jake to stay at their house but let his daughter stay. The friend ended up on the streets, and the author's wife is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the emotional state of Jake. He's grieving, which can cloud judgment and lead to impulsive actions. He came to the author's house in a vulnerable moment, seeking help. The author's decision to let the child stay but not him might be seen as splitting the family, which could add to Jake's distress. \n\nThe author's reasoning was to help Jake move past his grief by not enabling him. But is pushing someone who's in a mental health crisis the right approach? There's a difference between encouraging resilience and causing harm. If Jake went to the streets, maybe the author didn't consider the immediate safety and well-being of both Jake and his daughter. \n\nAlso, the author's wife is upset, which indicates that the decision might have been seen as harsh. While the intention was good, the outcome was negative. Friends in crisis need support, not rejection, even if it's for their own good in the long run. The author could have found an alternative solution, like helping them find temporary housing or contacting other friends. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, even if the author didn't intend for Jake to end up on the streets, their actions contributed to that outcome. The key question is whether refusing Jake's stay was a reasonable action given the circumstances. Grief can impair decision-making, and in such cases, friends might need to step in more actively rather than set boundaries that lead to dangerous situations. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author's actions might be seen as harmful despite good intentions. Therefore, the answer could be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
