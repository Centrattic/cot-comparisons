He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is at fault for not letting their best friend stay overnight after his wife's death.\n\nFirst, the context: Jake's wife died a month ago, he's struggling with depression, using alcohol and sleeping pills. He showed up unannounced at the author's house with his 3-year-old daughter. The author allowed the child to stay but refused Jake. Jake left in a bad state and later ended up sleeping on the streets, which the author's wife is upset about.\n\nSo the question is whether the author did the right thing. On one hand, the author might think they're helping Jake by pushing him to cope and not enabling his dependency. On the other hand, refusing help when someone is in crisis could be seen as neglecting their friend's immediate needs, especially when a child is involved. \n\nJake's actions (taking sleeping pills, being emotionally unstable) suggest he might be in a vulnerable state. The author allowed the daughter to stay, which is good, but not allowing the father might have left Jake without support. The author's intention was to help him move past the grief, but maybe they didn't consider the immediate consequences of Jake's possible breakdown.\n\nThe key points are the friend's mental health, the presence of a child, and the refusal to offer temporary shelter. While the author had good intentions, the outcome was negative. In such situations, sometimes providing temporary shelter is necessary for safety and emotional support, even if it's not a long-term solution. The author's refusal might have contributed to Jake's decision to sleep on the streets, which is a risk for both him and his daughter. \n\nSo, even if the author's intention was to push Jake to handle his grief, the action of not allowing him to stay might have been harmful. The balance between helping and enabling is tricky, but in a crisis, immediate support is often needed. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider the real-time impact of their decision on Jake's well-being and the child's safety.\n"
