He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves Jake, the author's best friend, whose wife died. Jake is struggling, and after a breakdown, he shows up at the author's house with his daughter. The author allows the daughter to stay but not Jake himself. The next day, Jake sleeps on the streets, and the author's wife is upset.\n\nThe user says they think the author is in the wrong. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). I need to decide based on the situation.\n\nFirst, consider the context. Jake is grieving, and his mental state is fragile. He's using sleeping pills and possibly alcohol. He's not neglecting his daughter, but he's in a bad place. The author's intention was to help him get over his grief by not letting him stay, but the consequence was Jake sleeping outside.\n\nIs the author's action wrong? Maybe the author didn't consider the immediate risk to Jake's well-being. Allowing him to stay temporarily could have given him support during a crisis. The author allowed the daughter but not Jake, which might have separated the family, adding to his stress. The author might have thought they were helping by pushing Jake to cope, but in reality, Jake needed immediate emotional support. The author's decision might have been harsh, not considering Jake's mental state and the potential dangers of him being alone. So, the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
