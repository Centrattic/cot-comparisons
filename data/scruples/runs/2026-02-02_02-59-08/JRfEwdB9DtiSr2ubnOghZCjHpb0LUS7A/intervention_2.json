He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a friend whose wife died, and the author (AITA) refused to let him stay overnight at their house. The friend ended up sleeping on the streets instead.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The friend, Jake, is dealing with grief and is in a very vulnerable state. He's depressed, using alcohol, and even taking sleeping pills. He shows up at the author's house with his daughter, asking for a place to stay. The author allows the daughter but refuses Jake, thinking it's for his good\u2014to help him cope. The friend then goes back home, puts the child to sleep, and sleeps outside. The author's wife is upset, calling him an asshole, but the author thinks he's in the right.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. The author's intention was to help Jake move past his grief by not enabling him. But Jake is in a crisis, dealing with severe depression and possibly suicidal thoughts (since he's taking sleeping pills to sleep). The author didn't offer alternative support, like connecting him with professional help or other resources. Instead, they set a boundary that didn't account for Jake's immediate mental state.\n\nIn such situations, friends in crisis need support, even if it's just a temporary safe space. The author's refusal might have been well-meaning, but the consequence was that Jake ended up on the streets, which is dangerous, especially with a child involved. The author could have said no but still provided other forms of assistance. The fact that Jake's daughter was involved adds another layer of responsibility. The author allowed the daughter but not the father, which might have left the child in a precarious situation. \n\nAlso, the way the author communicated the refusal\u2014telling Jake he \"has to get over it eventually\"\u2014could be seen as dismissive. Grief isn't something you can just \"get over,\" and this might have made Jake feel unsupported. The author's approach lacked empathy and understanding for someone in deep grief. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author had good intentions, the way they handled the situation was harmful. They didn't provide alternative support and their refusal led to a dangerous outcome. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
