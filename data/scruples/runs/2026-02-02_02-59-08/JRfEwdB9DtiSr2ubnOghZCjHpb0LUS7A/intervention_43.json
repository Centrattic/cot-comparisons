He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the person asking \"Am I the Asshole?\") is in the wrong when they refused to let their best friend stay the night after the friend's wife died.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. Jake's wife died recently, and he's struggling with depression, drinking, and sleeping. He showed up at the author's house in the middle of the night with his daughter, asking to stay. The author allowed the daughter to stay but not Jake, thinking that Jake needed to learn to cope. Then Jake went to sleep on the streets, and the author's wife is upset with them.\n\nSo, the author's reasoning was to help Jake get over his grief. But does that justify refusing him shelter? Let's think about the key points here. Jake is emotionally distraught, possibly in crisis, and the author's response might have contributed to him sleeping outdoors. Is the author being selfish or not?\n\nOn one hand, the author might feel that pushing Jake to be independent is the right approach. But when someone is in emotional distress, they might need support rather than being forced to cope immediately. The fact that Jake's daughter was allowed to stay shows some level of compassion, but excluding Jake could be seen as not providing the necessary support. \n\nAlso, Jake had taken sleeping pills, which is a red flag for potential self-harm. The author might not have considered the immediate safety of their friend. Even if the intention was to help, the outcome was harmful. The line between helping someone heal and enabling their suffering is thin here. \n\nIn times of grief, people often need temporary support to keep them from making worse decisions. By refusing to let Jake stay, the author might have deprived him of a safe place when he was vulnerable. The wife's anger makes sense because the action led to Jake being on the streets, which is dangerous, especially when he's emotionally unstable.\n\nSo, considering that the author's decision had negative consequences and there were other ways to help Jake without kicking him out, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong. Their intention might be good, but the execution was harmful.\n"
