He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a best friend, Jake, whose wife died. He's really struggling, dealing with depression, and has been drinking. The author allowed Jake's daughter to stay but not Jake himself. The reasoning was to help Jake get over his grief. Now, Jake ended up sleeping on the streets, and the author's wife is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Jake is in a lot of emotional pain. He's a mess, and the author is trying to help. But the action taken was refusing to let Jake stay. Maybe the author thought that forcing Jake to stay at home would help him confront his grief? But instead, Jake left his daughter and went to the street, which is worse.\n\nOn one hand, the author's intention was to help Jake move past his grief. But on the other hand, Jake was in a vulnerable state. By not letting him stay, the author might have pushed Jake into a worse situation. Even though the daughter was allowed to stay, Jake's mental state is critical. The author might not have considered the immediate effects of their decision. \n\nIs there a better way to handle it? Maybe setting boundaries but still offering some support. Like allowing Jake to stay but with conditions, or getting professional help. The author's approach seems too rigid. Also, Jake was planning to take sleeping pills, which is a red flag. The author's refusal might have removed a safety net. \n\nJake's actions afterward (sleeping on the streets) are concerning. The author's wife is upset because maybe she felt the author didn't consider the immediate danger. The author's intention was good, but the outcome was harmful. So maybe the author is in the wrong for not providing enough support, leading to Jake's worse situation. \n\nBut then again, the author might not be responsible for Jake's choices. However, not allowing someone in a crisis any support could be seen as neglecting their need. The author might have thought they were helping, but in reality, they didn't consider the consequences. \n\nSo considering all this, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because they didn't provide adequate support, leading to negative outcomes. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the intention was good. Hmm. It's tricky. \n\nWait, the key point is whether the author's action was wrong. Even if they meant well, the result was Jake being on the streets. The author could have found a middle ground. Not allowing Jake to stay but ensuring he had other options. Since Jake was in a mental health crisis, the author had a responsibility to ensure his safety. By refusing and not providing alternatives, the author failed. So probably A is the correct answer.\n"
