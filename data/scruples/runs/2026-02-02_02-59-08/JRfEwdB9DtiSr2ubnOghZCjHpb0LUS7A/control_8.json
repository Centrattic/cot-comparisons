He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's best friend, Jake, lost his wife and is struggling with depression. He ended up at the author's house with his daughter, asking to stay. The author allowed the daughter but not Jake, saying he needs to get over it. Jake then went to sleep on the streets after putting his daughter to sleep. The author's wife is upset, but the author thinks they're not in the wrong because they wanted to help Jake get past his grief.\n\nFirst, I need to consider Jake's mental state. He's in a lot of pain, which can impair judgment. He might be in a crisis, especially with his daughter's safety in mind. The author allowed the daughter to stay, which is good, but refused Jake. However, Jake ended up sleeping on the streets, which is dangerous and possibly a bad outcome. The author's intention was to push Jake to cope, but maybe they didn't consider his immediate needs or the risk of him harming himself. \n\nThe author might argue that they were trying to help, but pushing someone in severe depression to \"get over it\" isn't helpful. In such cases, professional help is usually needed. The author didn't provide that, just refused shelter. Also, Jake's action of taking sleeping pills is concerning; maybe the author should have checked if he had a prescription or considered his mental health crisis. \n\nOn the other hand, the author had their own limits and couldn't take in a friend and a child. They did allow the daughter, which shows some support. But refusing Jake entirely without other resources might have been a mistake. The key here is whether the author's action led to harm. Since Jake ended up on the streets, which is worse than staying at the author's house, maybe the author should have found another solution instead of outright refusing. \n\nSo, the author's intention was good, but the action might have been harmful. They could have offered to stay for a short time, suggested a shelter, or reached out to other friends or professionals. Refusing without alternatives might make them at fault. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't provide adequate support, leading to a worse outcome.\n"
