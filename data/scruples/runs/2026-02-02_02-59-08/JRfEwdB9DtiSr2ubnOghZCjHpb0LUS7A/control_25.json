He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not allowing their best friend, Jake, to stay at their house after his wife died. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. Jake's wife died recently, he's struggling a lot, and he's been drinking or sleeping. He told the author he was taking sleeping pills. Then, one night he showed up at the author's door with his daughter, asking to stay. The author said his daughter could stay, but not him. Jake left angry, and later went to sleep on the streets. The author's wife is upset, but the author thinks they're helping.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's intention was to help Jake get past his grief, but their action might have been harmful. Jake was in a vulnerable state, and the author's refusal might have forced him into a worse situation. Even if the author meant well, there's the question of whether they should have considered the immediate safety and well-being of Jake and his daughter.\n\nJake might have been in a crisis, possibly suicidal, given he mentioned taking sleeping pills. The author's decision to let the daughter stay but not Jake could have left him without a safe place, leading him to sleep outdoors. Even if the author wanted to encourage independence, Jake's mental state might have required more support, not pushing him to handle it alone.\n\nThe author's wife called them a \"massive asshole,\" which suggests that the action was seen as cruel. The author's reasoning is that they wanted to help him move past his grief, but the immediate consequence was potentially endangering Jake and his daughter. There's a balance between helping someone through grief and providing necessary support. In this case, the author might have been too focused on their own approach without considering the immediate risks.\n\nI think the author is in the wrong because they rejected Jake's request for help when he was clearly struggling, which led to him being on the streets. Even if the intention was good, the action had negative consequences. The right approach might have been to let him stay temporarily while also encouraging professional help. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
