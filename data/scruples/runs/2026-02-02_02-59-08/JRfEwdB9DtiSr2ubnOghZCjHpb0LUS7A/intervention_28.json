He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit-style \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's best friend, Jake, who's going through a really tough time after his wife's death. The author refused to let Jake stay over, even though Jake showed up with his 3-year-old daughter. The author's reasoning was that Jake needs to overcome his grief, and he allowed the daughter to stay but not Jake. Then Jake went to sleep on the streets, which upset the author's wife.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the emotional state of Jake. Grief is a heavy burden, and when someone is dealing with it, especially after a traumatic event like a spouse's death, they might not be in the best state of mind. The author mentions that Jake is depressed, drinking, and taking sleeping pills. There's a risk here\u2014sleeping pills combined with alcohol could be dangerous. The fact that Jake took sleeping pills to force himself to sleep is concerning. The author might not want to be responsible if Jake harms himself, but that's a different angle.\n\nThe author's intention was to help Jake get over his grief, but by not allowing him to stay. However, Jake has a child to care for. By letting the daughter stay but not him, the author might be separating a parent from their child, which could be even more traumatic for the little girl. The daughter's safety and emotional well-being should also be considered. Even if Jake is struggling, he's still the parent, and being separated from him might not be in the child's best interest.\n\nThen there's the consequence: Jake ended up sleeping on the streets. The author claims that wasn't the intention, but the outcome was harmful. The wife called the author a massive asshole, which indicates that the wife thought the decision was harsh. The author's reasoning is that forcing Jake to cope is the right approach, but in reality, people in crisis often need support and understanding, not being pushed to deal with it alone immediately. \n\nThere's also the aspect of being a best friend. Best friends are supposed to support each other through tough times. By turning Jake away, the author might be failing in that role. Even if the author had valid concerns, there might be other ways to help, like contacting a counselor, getting professional help, or arranging for another friend or family member to take him in. \n\nThe key points here are empathy, the safety of Jake and his daughter, and the role of support during grief. The author might have thought they were helping, but the action led to Jake sleeping on the streets, which could be seen as neglecting the immediate needs of a friend in crisis. The decision to let the daughter stay but not the father could be isolating the child and not providing the necessary support system for Jake to handle his responsibilities as a parent.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's actions might be seen as not being in the wrong (B) if they had good intentions, but the outcome and the way they handled it could be problematic. However, the immediate needs of the friend and his child might outweigh the long-term goal of overcoming grief. The author's approach might be too harsh without considering the immediate consequences. Therefore, the answer could lean towards A (author is in the wrong) because they didn't provide necessary support, leading to a worse outcome.\n"
