He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. So the scenario is about their best friend, Jake, whose wife just died. He's struggling a lot, dealing with depression, and even mentioned taking sleeping pills. He approaches the author and his daughter at 1 AM, asking to stay the night. The author says the daughter can stay but not Jake, leading Jake to leave and later end up on the streets.\n\nHmm. The author's reasoning is that they wanted to help Jake get over his grief. But from an outsider's perspective, turning down someone in such a vulnerable state might not be the best approach. Especially since Jake is a mess, maybe not thinking clearly, and putting his daughter to sleep, then going to the streets. The author's wife is upset, calling them a massive asshole. \n\nI need to consider if the author's action was reasonable. On one hand, they might have thought they were pushing Jake to face reality. On the other, denying him shelter when he's in a crisis could be seen as heartless. Even if it was a bad decision, the immediate effect was making Jake end up on the streets, which is a serious consequence. \n\nThe key points here are the intent vs. the impact. The author intended to help, but the impact was harmful. In such situations, mental health and emotional support are crucial. People in deep grief might need more compassion and practical help, not being turned away when they reach out. The author might have a good intention, but the action could be considered wrong because it didn't consider Jake's immediate needs and safety. \n\nSo, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because while intentions matter, the action of refusing help during a crisis can have severe consequences, especially when someone is in a vulnerable state. The author should have offered both the daughter and Jake shelter, maybe with a conversation about their concerns, rather than rejecting outright.\n"
