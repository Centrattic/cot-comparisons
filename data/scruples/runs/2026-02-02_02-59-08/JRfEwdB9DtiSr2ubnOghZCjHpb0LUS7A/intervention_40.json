He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a best friend, Jake, whose wife died. He's struggling a lot and ended up crashing at the author's house. The author allowed the daughter to stay but not Jake, which led to him sleeping on the streets. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. Jake is in a state of grief, depression, and possibly substance abuse. He's trying to cope by taking sleeping pills, which is not healthy. The author's intention was to help Jake by not enabling him, but the outcome was that Jake slept outside, which the wife found out and criticized the author.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's decision to not let Jake stay, leading to a negative consequence, and the question of whether that decision was wrong. \n\nOn one hand, the author might believe that allowing Jake to stay would prevent him from facing his grief and getting better. The idea is to push him to deal with the situation, not to avoid it. But on the other hand, Jake was in a vulnerable state, and leaving him to sleep on the streets could be seen as harsh and not supportive. Even if the author didn't want to enable his current coping mechanism, there's a balance between supporting someone in grief and letting them handle it on their own.\n\nJake's actions\u2014taking sleeping pills and avoiding his house\u2014suggest he's not handling his grief well. The author's wife is upset because they didn't take him in, but maybe the author thought it was important for Jake to start facing his reality. However, the author might not have considered the immediate safety and well-being of Jake and his daughter. Sleeping on the streets, even if the author didn't intend it, could put them in danger, especially with the child involved.\n\nThe author's approach could be seen as setting a boundary, but in a situation where a friend is clearly struggling, maybe the support should involve more compassion and flexibility. Instead of outright refusing, perhaps offering a different solution, like a short-term stay with conditions, or helping him find a temporary place elsewhere, would have been better.\n\nAlso, the fact that Jake left with a \"dirty glare\" and without saying anything shows the emotional state he's in. The author might have contributed to Jake feeling abandoned or not supported, which could worsen his mental health. Even if the intention was good, the action led to a harmful outcome. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's tricky because there's no clear right answer. But the main issue is that the author didn't allow Jake to stay, and Jake ended up in a worse situation. The question is whether the author acted unkindly by not offering more support. The daughter being present adds another layer; the author allowed the child but not the father, which might have been confusing and hurtful for the daughter.\n\nI think the author might be in the wrong because during such a traumatic time, the friend needed support and understanding. Refusing to let him stay at home without providing an alternative could be seen as not being there for him. However, the author's intention was to help him move past the grief. It's a balance between being supportive and encouraging healthy coping. But in this case, the result was negative, so the approach might have been too rigid.\n"
