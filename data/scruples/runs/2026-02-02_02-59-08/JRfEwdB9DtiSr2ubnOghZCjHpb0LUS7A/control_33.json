He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the user's best friend, Jake, lost his wife. He's really struggling, dealing with depression, drinking, and sleeping a lot. He told the user he can't be in his house, took sleeping pills, and then showed up unannounced at their house with his daughter. The user allowed the daughter to stay but not Jake, thinking he needed to get over it. Jake then slept on the streets, which the user's wife found out and called the user an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the user's intentions. They wanted to help Jake move past his grief, but their method was to not let him stay. But Jake is in a vulnerable state, dealing with the loss of his spouse. Is it right to deny him shelter? He's a friend, and the user is in a position to help. The user's wife is upset because Jake ended up on the streets. The user might have thought that by not letting Jake stay, they were pushing him to cope, but maybe they didn't consider that Jake was in a crisis and needed immediate support.\n\nJake's actions\u2014taking sleeping pills, being a mess\u2014indicate he's in a mental health crisis. Allowing him to sleep on the streets could be dangerous. The user allowed the daughter but not Jake, which might have led Jake to leave the child alone, which is a safety issue. However, the user might have thought that Jake needed to face his grief, but in reality, a friend in such a state might need more support, not less.\n\nThe user's reasoning is that they wanted to help Jake get over his wife's death by not accommodating his avoidance of home. But forcing someone to confront their pain without support can be harmful. Jake's response was to go to the streets, which is worse. The user's actions might have been well-intentioned, but the outcome was negative. The user's wife is upset because they didn't consider the immediate consequences. The user's approach might be seen as not being supportive enough during a time when Jake needed help. So, maybe the user is in the wrong because they denied their friend support when he was in a vulnerable state, leading to a dangerous situation. The answer might be A.\n"
