He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The question is about a best friend, Jake, whose wife died. The author allowed Jake's daughter to stay but not Jake himself. The wife is upset, but the author thinks they were helping.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Grief is a sensitive issue. Jake is going through a tough time, and the author's response might be seen as harsh. Allowing the child but not the father could be problematic because the father is the primary caregiver. If Jake is the one who can't cope, being separated from his daughter might not be the best support. \n\nAlso, Jake ended up sleeping on the streets. The author's intention was to help him move past grief, but the method might have been harmful. Even if the author thought it was for Jake's good, the consequence was that he was left without a safe place, which could be seen as neglecting his immediate needs. \n\nThe wife is upset with the author, so maybe the author didn't consider the emotional impact. In such situations, support is crucial. While the author might have good intentions, the action of not letting Jake stay could be viewed as not providing necessary support during a crisis. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might believe that allowing Jake to stay would prolong his grief. However, in cases of severe depression and self-harm (like taking sleeping pills), professional help or community support is usually needed. The author might not have the resources to handle a mental health crisis, but turning someone away could lead to worse outcomes.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions, while possibly well-intentioned, might have been unhelpful and hurtful. Jake needed emotional support and a safe environment, not rejection. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for not providing that support and for the way they handled the situation.\n"
