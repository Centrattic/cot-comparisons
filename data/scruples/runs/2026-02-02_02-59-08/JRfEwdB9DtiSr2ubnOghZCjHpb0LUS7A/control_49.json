He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a best friend, Jake, whose wife died. The author allowed Jake's daughter to stay but refused him. The user wants to know if the author did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. Jake is struggling with grief, using pills and alcohol. He shows up unannounced with his daughter. The author lets the kid stay but not Jake. Then Jake sleeps on the streets, which caused the wife to get angry.\n\nHmm. The author's reasoning is that Jake needs to get over his grief. But is that valid? Grief is complex. The author might have thought they were helping, but refusing Jake could have pushed him to a worse place. Jake's actions (sleeping pills, self-harm risks) suggest he's in crisis. The author's refusal might have removed a safety net.\n\nAlso, considering Jake's responsibility to his daughter. The author allowed the child to sleep over, but Jake is a parent. If he's not neglecting the child, maybe the author's focus was misplaced. However, Jake's mental health is critical here. He might be in a fragile state, and the author's approach could be seen as unsupportive.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's intention wasn't to harm Jake. They wanted to help him move past the grief. But the method might be wrong. Instead of cutting him off, maybe setting boundaries with support would be better. For example, staying with him but encouraging professional help.\n\nThe key points are: Jake's mental health is at risk, the author's refusal led to Jake sleeping outside, and the wife is upset. The question is whether the author's action was inconsiderate or necessary.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at intentions and consequences. The author's intention was to help, but the consequence was harmful. However, the author didn't push Jake to harm himself; they just refused their own home. But Jake's decision to go to the streets might be a result of feeling abandoned.\n\nI think the author is partially at fault. They should have considered Jake's immediate needs and maybe found another solution. Refusing without offering alternatives or support could be seen as unkind. So the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong). But maybe B? Wait, the author's intention was to help, but the action was misguided. Maybe the answer is A because they didn't provide sufficient support despite knowing Jake's unstable state.\n"
