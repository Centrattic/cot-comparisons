He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a best friend, Jake, whose wife died. The author (AITA) refused to let Jake stay at their house, only allowing his daughter. Jake then went on the streets, and the wife is upset with the author.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points are that Jake is in a severe state of grief, possibly with depression and suicidal tendencies (he's taking sleeping pills). The author's reasoning was to help him get over the loss by not letting him stay, assuming he needs to deal with it. However, the consequence was Jake being on the streets, which is dangerous and not helpful. \n\nGrief can be very unpredictable. People in such states might not make rational decisions. The author might have thought that by not accommodating Jake, they're pushing him to handle it himself. But given that Jake's behavior is concerning (sleeping pills, inability to cope), the author might have a responsibility to ensure his safety. Allowing Jake to stay temporarily could have provided support, even if it's not the author's house. \n\nThe author's wife is upset because they didn't consider the immediate risk. The author's intention was good but the action led to a negative outcome. In such situations, mental health professionals usually advise against leaving someone in crisis alone. The author might be in the wrong because they didn't provide necessary support, even if their reasoning was to help Jake eventually. \n\nAlso, the author allowed Jake's daughter to stay, which shows some willingness to help. But refusing Jake could have been a misstep. It's possible that the best approach is to offer help while encouraging professional support, rather than cutting off support entirely. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's action might be seen as inconsiderate, even if the intention was good. The answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they didn't provide necessary support during a crisis, leading to a harmful outcome for Jake.\n"
