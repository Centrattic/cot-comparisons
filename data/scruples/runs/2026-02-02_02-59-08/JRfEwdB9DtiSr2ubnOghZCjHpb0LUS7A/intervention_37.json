He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's best friend, Jake, lost his wife and is really struggling. He showed up at the author's house in the middle of the night with his daughter, asking to stay. The author let the daughter stay but not Jake, saying he needs to get over it. Jake then went to sleep on the streets, and the author's wife is upset with him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the emotional state of Jake. He's grieving, which is a really intense time. Grief can make people act in ways they wouldn't normally. The author's reasoning is that Jake needs to deal with his grief and not avoid his house. That makes sense from a psychological perspective\u2014avoiding the environment where the loss occurred might hinder the healing process. But on the other hand, Jake is actively using sleeping pills, which could be a sign of self-harm or at least poor coping mechanisms. \n\nThe author did allow Jake's daughter to stay, which is good, but refused Jake. The problem here is that Jake didn't just go to his house and then to the streets by himself; he left his daughter there. The author's wife called him an asshole, but the author's intention was to help Jake deal with his grief. However, the consequence was that Jake ended up on the streets, which is a dangerous situation. \n\nI should think about the responsibility of friends in times of crisis. If someone is in emotional distress and at risk of self-harm, the appropriate response might be to offer support rather than to push them to confront their pain immediately. The author might have thought they were helping by making Jake face his house, but Jake was in a state where he wasn't thinking clearly. \n\nAlso, considering the presence of a 3-year-old daughter, Jake's responsibility to her is significant. The author allowing the daughter to stay shows they were concerned, but not offering a safe place for Jake might have led to him making a bad decision. \n\nIn terms of accountability, the author might have had good intentions but didn't consider the immediate safety of Jake. Even if avoiding the house is a bad long-term solution, in the short term, being alone at night with depression and pills could be risky. The author could have set boundaries but also offered support, like staying in touch to ensure Jake was okay after he left.\n\nSo, while the author's reasoning about helping Jake deal with his grief isn't entirely wrong, the action of refusing him and the resulting consequences might make them at fault. The key is balancing the intention to help with the actual immediate risks. Since Jake ended up on the streets, which could have been preventable if the author had offered more support, the author might be in the wrong for not providing a safer alternative.\n"
