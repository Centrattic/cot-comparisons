He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. So the question is whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not letting their best friend stay over after his wife died. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: Jake's wife died recently, and he's really struggling. He's drinking and sleeping a lot. He went to the author's house at 1 AM with his daughter, asking to stay. The author said the daughter could stay but Jake couldn't. Then Jake went back home, put the kid to sleep, and slept on the streets. The author's wife is upset, but the author thinks they were right to push Jake to deal with his grief.\n\nHmm. So the key points here. The author is a friend trying to help, but their approach might have been harsh. Let's think about the possible angles. On one hand, the author might have been trying to encourage Jake to face his emotions and not avoid his home. But on the other hand, Jake was in a vulnerable state, and sending him out into the streets could be dangerous. Also, he has a young daughter. Even if the author didn't allow Jake to stay, maybe they could have offered another solution, like finding a shelter or another place for him to stay temporarily. The fact that he ended up on the streets suggests that the author's approach might have been too rigid without considering Jake's immediate needs for safety and stability.\n\nAdditionally, the author allowed the daughter to stay, which is good, but maybe they should have found a way to support Jake without cutting him off entirely. Emotional support is crucial during grief, and pushing someone too hard might not be helpful. The author's intention was good, but the action might not have been the best. There's a balance between being supportive and forcing someone to confront their pain. If Jake was in a state where he needed time and support, maybe the author should have been more accommodating, even if it meant Jake staying for a few nights, as long as it didn't cause problems. However, the author might have been concerned about enabling avoidance behavior, which is a valid point. But ending up on the streets is extreme and could have been prevented with better alternatives.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's decision might have been well-intentioned but perhaps lacked consideration for Jake's immediate safety and emotional state. The answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't provide a safe alternative for Jake, leading to him sleeping outside. But maybe the author wasn't in the wrong if they thought they were helping him face his grief. However, the outcome was harmful. It's a tricky situation. Maybe the middle ground is that the author isn't entirely in the wrong but could have handled it better. But the question is whether they are in the wrong at all. Since the outcome was Jake on the streets, which is bad, the author might share some responsibility. I think the answer is A, but I'm a bit conflicted.\n"
