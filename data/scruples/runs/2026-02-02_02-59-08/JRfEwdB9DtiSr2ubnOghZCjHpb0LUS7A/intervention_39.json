He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not letting their friend stay over after his wife died. \n\nFirst, the situation: Jake's wife died recently, he's really struggling, and he ended up showing up at the author's house in the middle of the night with his daughter. The author allowed the daughter to stay but not Jake, saying he needs to get over it eventually. Then Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, and slept on the street. The author's wife is upset, but the author thinks they were right.\n\nSo, I need to consider different angles. Grief can affect people in various ways. Jake is clearly in a bad place, maybe not thinking clearly. The author's intention was to help him move past the grief, but by not letting him stay, maybe they caused him to take a harmful action. \n\nOn one hand, the author might think that letting Jake stay would make him avoid dealing with his emotions. But on the other hand, when someone is in crisis, especially with a child involved, their immediate safety and well-being matter. The author's response could have pushed Jake into a worse situation. \n\nAlso, there's the aspect of being a good friend. If someone is truly struggling and in crisis, even if their behavior isn't ideal, supporting them might be more important than enforcing a lesson. The author's approach might be seen as cold or not empathetic enough during a vulnerable time. \n\nJake's actions\u2014taking sleeping pills, showing up in the middle of the night\u2014indicate he's in a dangerous emotional state. The author's refusal might have led him to a worse decision, like sleeping outside while his daughter is asleep. That could be seen as neglecting his responsibility as a parent, but maybe the author's decision contributed to that indirectly. \n\nThe author's wife called them an asshole, which suggests that the immediate community's perspective is that the author was wrong. The author's reasoning is about helping Jake get over the loss, but in a crisis, sometimes people need support, not a lesson in coping. \n\nSo, putting it all together, I think the author is in the wrong. They prioritized a lesson in moving on over providing necessary support during a crisis, which might have led to a dangerous outcome for Jake and his daughter. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
