He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is wrong for not letting their best friend, Jake, stay at their house after his wife died. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. Jake is grieving, his wife died in a car accident. He's struggling, becoming depressed, drinking, sleeping a lot. He asked the author to let him and his daughter stay over because he couldn't be in his house anymore. The author said yes to the daughter but not to Jake. Then Jake ended up sleeping on the streets. The author's wife is upset, but the author thinks they were trying to help.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nI need to consider the context. Grief can make people act out, but so can their friends' decisions. The author's reasoning was that Jake needs to get over it eventually. But maybe that's a harsh way to put it. Jake was in a fragile state, and by not allowing him to stay, the author might have inadvertently caused him to sleep on the street, which is dangerous, especially with a young daughter.\n\nBut the author allowed the daughter to stay, so maybe they were trying to be helpful without enabling Jake's dependency. However, Jake's actions (sleeping pills) are concerning, and the author might have been worried about his mental state. But turning him away without another plan could be seen as not supporting him when he needed help the most.\n\nThere's a balance between supporting someone and pushing them to move forward. However, in a crisis, immediate support is crucial. The author's refusal might have been well-intentioned but lacked empathy in the moment. Also, Jake's daughter's safety is a factor. If Jake was too impaired to care for her, maybe the author should have considered alternative arrangements instead of just saying no.\n\nOn the other hand, the author did allow the daughter to stay, so they weren't completely unhelpful. But maybe they could have found a way to help Jake without enabling his avoidance. Maybe setting boundaries while still offering support. But in an emotional situation like this, the approach might need to be more compassionate.\n\nI think the key points are: the author's intention was to help, but the method of turning Jake away without ensuring he had a safe place might have been wrong. Grieving people need support, and the author's refusal could have contributed to a dangerous situation. So the answer might be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
