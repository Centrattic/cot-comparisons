He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that Jake's wife died, he's really struggling, and he showed up at the author's house with his daughter. The author allowed the daughter to stay but not Jake. Then Jake went back home, put the kid to sleep, and slept on the streets. The author's wife is upset, but the author thinks they were right to push Jake to handle his grief.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Jake is dealing with a significant loss, which is a huge emotional burden. He's not coping well, using alcohol and sleeping pills, which aren't healthy coping mechanisms. The author's intention was to help Jake by not letting him stay, thinking he needs to face his grief. But the consequence was that Jake ended up on the streets, which is dangerous, especially with a young daughter. However, the daughter was with him initially, but later he left her at home while he slept outside. That part is concerning because a 3-year-old should not be left alone. \n\nThe author allowed the daughter to stay but not Jake. Maybe they were trying to show that they care about the child's safety but not about Jake's immediate needs. But by sending Jake away, they might have inadvertently caused him to take a risk by sleeping on the streets. The author's reasoning is that Jake needs to get over his grief, but grief isn't something you just \"get over.\" It's a process, and sometimes support is necessary. \n\nThe key points here are the author's actions versus the outcome. The author didn't mean to put Jake on the streets, but their decision led to that. Also, considering Jake's mental state\u2014using pills and being depressed\u2014might mean he was in a vulnerable position where he needed support, not being pushed to confront his grief alone. \n\nThere's a balance between helping someone and letting them handle their issues. The author might have thought they were helping by encouraging independence, but in reality, Jake might need more hands-on support. The author's decision could be seen as not providing enough support during a crisis. Additionally, the fact that the daughter was left alone is another issue. The author allowed the daughter to stay, which is good, but Jake's need for emotional support shouldn't be ignored, especially if it's affecting his ability to care for his child.\n\nIn terms of social norms and expectations, friends often step in during times of crisis. The author might have been too strict by not allowing Jake to stay, even temporarily. While it's important to encourage healing, sometimes allowing someone to grieve and find stability is necessary. The author's approach might have been harsh, leading to negative consequences. Therefore, the author could be seen as at fault for not providing the necessary support during a critical time.\n"
