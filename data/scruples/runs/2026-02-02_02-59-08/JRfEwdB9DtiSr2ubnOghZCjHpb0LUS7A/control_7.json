He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting their best friend stay after his wife died. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, Jake's wife died recently, and he's really struggling. He's depressed, drinking, and not handling it well. He tried to stay at the author's house but the author only allowed his daughter. Then Jake went to sleep on the streets, and the author's wife is upset. The author thinks they were trying to help by pushing Jake to get over it.\n\nHmm, the key points here: the author might have thought they were helping, but Jake ended up in a worse situation. Allowing the daughter to stay but not Jake could be seen as not providing enough support. Even if the intention was good, the outcome was harmful. Jake was in a vulnerable state, and the author didn't consider the immediate risks, like him possibly harming himself or his daughter being left alone. \n\nThe author might be in the wrong because they should have prioritized Jake's well-being over their approach to helping. Maybe they should have let him stay, even if temporarily, while also seeking professional help. Denying him entry might have pushed him to make a desperate decision. The wife's reaction makes sense because the author's actions had negative consequences. So, the answer is likely A (author is in the wrong) because the approach was harmful despite good intentions.\n"
