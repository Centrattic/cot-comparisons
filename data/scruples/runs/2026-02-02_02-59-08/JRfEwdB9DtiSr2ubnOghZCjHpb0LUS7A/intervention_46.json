He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's best friend, Jake, lost his wife and is struggling with grief, leading to substance abuse and depression. The author refused to let Jake stay at their house, allowing only his daughter to stay. Jake then ended up sleeping on the streets, causing the author's wife to be upset. The author justifies this by saying they wanted to help Jake get over his grief.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Jake is in a vulnerable state after a traumatic loss. The author's intention was to push Jake to handle his grief, but the outcome was negative. However, by letting the daughter stay but not Jake, the author might have inadvertently put the child at risk if Jake was unstable. The author's actions could be seen as not being supportive at a critical time, even if the intention was to help. On the other hand, the author might argue that allowing Jake to stay could enable his destructive behavior (like drinking) and not help him move forward.\n\nBut the key point here is that the author didn't consider alternative solutions. For example, maybe offering support in a different way, like helping Jake with his daughter or connecting him with professional help, instead of cutting him off. The author's approach was abrupt and didn't provide any other support, leading Jake to sleep on the streets. That seems harsh and potentially harmful. The author's wife is right to be upset because the action might have endangered Jake's daughter as well. So, while the intention was to help, the execution was flawed and the author didn't take responsibility for the consequences. Therefore, the answer is probably A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
