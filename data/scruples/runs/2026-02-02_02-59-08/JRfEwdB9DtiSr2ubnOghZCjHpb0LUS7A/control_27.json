He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting their friend stay overnight after his wife died. The situation is pretty intense.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the details. Jake's wife died, he's really struggling, and the author's wife is upset with them. The author let Jake's daughter stay but not him. The reasoning was to help him get over it, but Jake ended up sleeping on the streets. \n\nHmm. Grief is a powerful thing. The author might have thought they were helping by pushing Jake to cope, but maybe they didn't consider how he was handling it. Jake was already at a breaking point, using pills and avoiding his house. Denying him a safe place might have made things worse. \n\nAlso, the author allowed the child to stay, which is good, but not supporting the parent could be an issue. Friends in grief need support, not added pressure. Even if the intention was to help, the outcome was harmful. The wife's reaction might be valid here. The author should have found another way to encourage coping without removing a support system. \n\nSo, I think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't provide the necessary support during a crisis, leading to a worse situation for Jake.\n"
