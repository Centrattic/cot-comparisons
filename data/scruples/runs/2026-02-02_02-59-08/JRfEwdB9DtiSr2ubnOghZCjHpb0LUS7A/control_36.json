He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong for not letting their best friend stay over after his wife died. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. Jake is dealing with the loss of his wife, which is a huge trauma. He's depressed, using alcohol, and taking sleeping pills. He shows up at the author's house at 1 AM with his daughter. The author allows the daughter to stay but refuses Jake. Then Jake ends up sleeping on the streets, which causes conflict.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they wanted to help Jake get through his grief by not enabling him. But Jake's actions\u2014taking sleeping pills, self-harm potential\u2014suggest a crisis. The author's decision might have been harsh, especially since Jake is a best friend. However, the author had a valid concern about enabling dependency. But Jake's mental state is critical; he might need immediate help, not just tough love. The fact that he's taking pills and the situation escalated to sleeping on the streets implies that the author didn't account for the severity of Jake's mental health crisis. Allowing him to stay might have provided temporary support, but the author's refusal led to a worse outcome. The wife's reaction also points out the emotional impact. The author might not be in the wrong for setting boundaries, but in a crisis, maybe they should have been more flexible. However, the key point is that Jake was in a severe mental state. The author didn't help him seek professional help either. So, there's a balance between enabling and supporting. Since Jake's actions indicate a possible suicide attempt (taking pills to sleep), the author's refusal could have contributed to the problem. Therefore, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong because they didn't consider the immediate danger Jake was in.\n"
