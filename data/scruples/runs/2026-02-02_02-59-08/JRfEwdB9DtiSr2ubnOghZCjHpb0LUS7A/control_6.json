He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting their best friend stay overnight after his wife died. The situation is that Jake, the friend, is struggling with depression and grief. He shows up at the author's door with his daughter, and the author allows the daughter to stay but not Jake, thinking he needs to get over it. Then Jake ends up sleeping on the streets, and the author's wife is upset with him.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author's intention was to help Jake move past his grief by not giving him a place to escape to. But Jake is in a vulnerable state, and the author's refusal might have pushed him to a desperate action. The key points here are the emotional state of Jake, the author's approach to helping, and the consequences.\n\nThe author might argue that they were trying to be tough love, pushing Jake to face his reality. However, when someone is in deep depression, especially after losing a spouse, their judgment and ability to cope can be severely impaired. By not allowing Jake to stay, the author might have removed a safety net that could have prevented him from making a harmful decision. Even if the intention was good, the outcome was negative, which could reflect poorly on the author's judgment.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't want to enable Jake's avoidance of his grief. But in a crisis, sometimes people need immediate support. The author could have considered a different approach, like staying in contact with Jake after he left, ensuring he had another support system, or offering a different kind of help. Refusing him entry without a plan to support him further might be seen as neglecting their responsibility as a friend in a critical moment.\n\nSo, considering Jake's mental state and the fact that he ended up on the streets, the author's action might be seen as contributing to his worsening situation. The author's decision, while intending to help, might have lacked the necessary compassion and proactive support needed in such a sensitive situation. Therefore, the answer could be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
