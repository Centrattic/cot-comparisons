He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (the person who posted the question) is in the wrong for not allowing their best friend Jake to stay at their house. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. Jake's wife died recently, and he's struggling with depression, drinking, and taking sleeping pills. He and his daughter showed up at the author's door in the middle of the night, and the author said the daughter could stay but Jake couldn't. Jake left and later ended up sleeping on the streets.\n\nSo the question is, was the author wrong to do that? \n\nLet's look at the key points. The author's intention was to help Jake get over his wife's death by not letting him stay. But Jake was in a vulnerable state\u2014depressed, using pills, and not in a good mental state. By sending him away, even if the intention was good, the outcome was that he went to sleep on the streets, which is dangerous. Also, the author's wife is upset because she thinks the author was cruel.\n\nOn one hand, the author might think they're pushing Jake to face his grief and build resilience. On the other hand, Jake was in a mental health crisis, and not providing support could be seen as neglecting his needs. \n\nThe author allowed the child to stay but not the father. That might be a point. If Jake was in a state where he couldn't take care of himself, maybe he needed support more. Also, Jake taking sleeping pills is a red flag for possible self-harm or suicide risk. Sending him out alone might have been irresponsible.\n\nThe author's reasoning was about helping him move on, but in a crisis situation, sometimes the immediate need is safety and support. If Jake was considering self-harm by taking pills, the author might have a duty to prevent that. Also, the author's action led to Jake sleeping outside, which could be dangerous and not a safe environment for someone in that state.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might have been wrong. Even if the intention was good, the action didn't consider Jake's immediate safety and mental health. The right approach might have been to involve other support systems, like family, friends, or professionals, rather than turning him away in the middle of the night when he was clearly in distress.\n"
