He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post) is in the wrong for not letting their best friend Jake stay at their house after his wife died.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. Jake's wife died a month ago, and he's really struggling. He's been drinking, sleeping a lot, and seems depressed. He tried to ask the author to let him and his daughter stay, but the author only allowed the daughter. The author's reasoning was to help Jake get over his grief, but Jake ended up sleeping on the streets. The wife is upset with the author, but the author doesn't think they're wrong.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author made the right decision. Let's break it down. Grief is a complex emotional state, and people handle it differently. Jake is in a vulnerable state, and the author is trying to help by pushing him to deal with his grief. But refusing to let Jake stay might have led to a worse outcome.\n\nThe author allowed the daughter to stay, which is good, but not helping Jake himself could be seen as not supportive enough. The author's intention was to help, but the result was Jake sleeping on the streets. That's a bad consequence. Even if the intention was good, the outcome might have been avoidable. Also, Jake was in a crisis, and the author, as a close friend, might have a responsibility to support him more directly.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that they were trying to encourage independence. But when someone is in severe grief and possibly suicidal (since he's taking sleeping pills), the immediate need is safety and support. The author could have offered to let Jake stay temporarily while also encouraging him to seek professional help, instead of turning him away, which led to a dangerous situation.\n\nSo, considering the context and the consequences, the author's approach might have been misguided. They could have handled it in a way that both provided support and encouraged healing, rather than pushing Jake away. Therefore, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong because their action, while well-intentioned, didn't adequately address Jake's immediate needs and resulted in harm.\n"
