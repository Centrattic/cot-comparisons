He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not allowing their best friend to stay overnight after his wife died. The key points here are the context of grief, the actions taken by the author, and the consequences.\n\nFirst, Jake's situation is extremely tragic. His wife died in a car crash, and he's struggling with depression, using alcohol and sleeping pills. He came to the author's house in the middle of the night with his daughter. The author allowed the child to stay but refused Jake. The reasoning was to help him get over his grief, but Jake ended up sleeping on the streets, which the author's wife found out and criticized him for.\n\nThe author argues that their intention was to push Jake to cope, but the outcome was harmful. The question is whether the action was wrong despite the intention. \n\nIn situations of deep grief and mental health struggles, support systems are crucial. The author might have thought they were being tough love, but refusing shelter without ensuring an alternative could be seen as neglecting immediate needs. Jake's actions (sleeping pills, going to the streets) suggest he's in crisis. The author didn't provide a safety net; they just set a boundary without considering if Jake would follow through safely. \n\nWhile the author had good intentions, the lack of follow-through to ensure Jake's safety could be seen as neglecting their responsibility as a friend. The best approach might have been to allow him to stay temporarily while also encouraging professional help or involving other friends/family to support him. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong for not considering the potential consequences of their refusal and not providing adequate support beyond setting a boundary.\n"
