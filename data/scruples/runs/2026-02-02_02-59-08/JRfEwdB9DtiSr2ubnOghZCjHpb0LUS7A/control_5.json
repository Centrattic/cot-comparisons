He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not allowing their friend Jake to stay overnight after his wife's death. So, I need to analyze the situation.\n\nFirst, the context: Jake is grieving, handling it poorly, has a 3-year-old daughter. He approached the author in the middle of the night, asking to stay. The author allowed the kid but not Jake. Jake then went to sleep on the streets, and the author's wife is upset with them. The author thinks they were trying to help by pushing Jake to cope.\n\nHmm. Grief is a heavy topic. Jake is in a vulnerable state. The author's intention was to help, but the action might have been too harsh. Allowing the daughter to stay but not Jake could separate the kid from her father during a crisis. Jake might be struggling to take care of his daughter, so being separated could add stress. Also, sleeping on the streets is dangerous, especially if he's under the influence of pills. The author didn't consider alternative solutions, like staying in a hotel or getting him help. There's a lack of empathy here. Even if the author wanted Jake to deal with his grief, the approach might not be supportive enough. The author's wife called them a massive asshole because their action led to Jake sleeping outside. The author's reasoning is about helping him get over it, but maybe they should have offered support while encouraging him to seek professional help instead of rejecting him outright. So, in terms of right or wrong, the author's action, though well-intentioned, might have caused harm. The key points are the immediate safety of Jake and his daughter, the lack of alternative solutions, and the emotional harm caused by rejection. So the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong. So the answer is A.\n"
