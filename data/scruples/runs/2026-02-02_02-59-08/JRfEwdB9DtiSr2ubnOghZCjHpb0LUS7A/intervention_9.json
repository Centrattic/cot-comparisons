He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about whether to let their best friend, Jake, stay over after his wife died. The author denied Jake entry but allowed his daughter to stay. The friend ended up sleeping on the streets, and the author's wife is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. Grief is a powerful emotion, and people under extreme stress might act unpredictably. Jake's wife died recently, and he's struggling with depression, drinking, and sleep issues. He came to the author's house at 1 AM, and the author allowed his daughter but not him. The author's reasoning was to help Jake face his grief, thinking he needed to get over it. \n\nThe key points are: Is refusing to let a grieving friend stay at your house, even if it leads to harmful consequences, morally wrong? The author's intention was to push Jake to cope, but the result was him sleeping outside. However, Jake's actions (using sleeping pills, being in a bad mental state) might indicate he's in a crisis. \n\nIn such cases, the immediate concern is safety. Allowing someone to stay even if it's late might be necessary if they're at risk of self-harm or endangerment. The author might not have considered that Jake's mental state could lead him to do something dangerous if not provided shelter. Denying him entry, even with good intentions, might have been a mistake because it resulted in him being on the streets, which is unsafe, especially with a toddler involved.\n\nAlso, the author allowed the daughter but not the father. That seems inconsistent. If the daughter is staying, the father might need to be there to care for her properly. Leaving the daughter with someone else while the father is on the streets could be neglectful. The author's decision might have led to a situation where the child's needs aren't fully met, as the father is essential for her care.\n\nAnother angle: The author's wife called them an asshole, which suggests that the community might see the action as harsh. Even if the intention was to help, the execution might have been lacking. People in grief need support, not being pushed to \"get over it.\" The author's approach might come across as dismissive of Jake's pain rather than supportive.\n\nHowever, the author did allow the daughter, so they weren't entirely cutting off support. But the refusal to let Jake in could be seen as not fully supporting a friend in dire need. The line between helping someone overcome grief and enabling harmful behavior is thin. In this case, the immediate need for safety and care for both Jake and his daughter might outweigh the author's intention to push Jake to cope.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author's action, while possibly well-intentioned, led to negative outcomes. Therefore, they might be in the wrong for not ensuring Jake's safety and possibly neglecting the needs of the child by not having a caregiver present. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
