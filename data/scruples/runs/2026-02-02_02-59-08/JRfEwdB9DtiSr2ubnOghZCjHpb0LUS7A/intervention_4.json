He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not letting their best friend stay overnight after his wife died. The friend had a breakdown, came to the author's house late at night, and the author refused him but allowed the daughter to stay. The friend then went back home, put the kid to sleep, and slept outside.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The friend is grieving, dealing with depression, and possibly a substance abuse issue. The author's reasoning was to help him get through the grief by not letting him stay, but the friend ended up on the streets. The author's wife is upset with him, and the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nSo, the key points here: the author turned down a friend in a vulnerable state. Even though the intention was to help, the outcome was the friend sleeping outside with a child. The author allowed the daughter to stay but not the father. Is that reasonable? Maybe the author thought the daughter needed to be safe, but the father's mental health is also a concern. However, the author might not have considered the immediate consequences of their refusal.\n\nGrief can cause people to make irrational decisions. By not offering support, the author might have inadvertently pushed the friend into a worse situation. Even if the author thought they were helping, the action of rejecting the friend could be seen as not providing necessary emotional support during a crisis. The fact that the friend took sleeping pills and was in a bad state adds to the gravity of the situation.\n\nBut on the other hand, the author might be overwhelmed and not able to host a friend who's in such a bad state. The line between helping and enabling could be blurry here. However, given that the friend has a child, the author's responsibility might extend to ensuring the child's safety, which he did by letting the daughter stay. But the father's well-being is also important. The author's approach might be seen as harsh, especially when the friend came in a state of desperation.\n\nIn terms of social norms, when someone is in a crisis, friends often step in to provide shelter or support. The author's refusal could be seen as a failure to support a friend in need, even if the intention was to encourage independence. The consequences of the friend sleeping outside are severe, which might make the author's decision look like it led to a negative outcome.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't provide the necessary support during a critical time, leading to the friend's worsened situation. The answer is A.\n"
