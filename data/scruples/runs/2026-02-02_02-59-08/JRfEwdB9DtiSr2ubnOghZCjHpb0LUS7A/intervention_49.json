He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who asked the question (the author) is in the wrong for not letting their best friend Jake crash at their house after his wife died. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: Jake's wife passed away in a car crash, and he's handling it really badly. He's depressed, drinking, and sleeping a lot. He's not neglecting his daughter, but he's struggling. Then, he shows up at the author's house at 1 AM with his daughter, asking to stay because he can't be in his house. The author says the daughter can stay but not Jake. Jake leaves angry, and later the author finds out Jake slept on the streets after putting his daughter to sleep.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they wanted to help Jake get over his wife's death by not enabling him to avoid his house. The wife thinks the author is an asshole, but the author doesn't think they are. The user says they think the author is in the wrong but want my opinion.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's consider both sides. On one hand, the author is trying to help Jake by pushing him to face his grief and not avoid his home. They might believe that by not letting Jake stay, they're encouraging him to deal with his emotions. But on the other hand, Jake was in a vulnerable state, showing signs of depression and possibly suicidal thoughts (taking sleeping pills). He brought his daughter, which shows he's trying to protect her, but he himself was in a crisis. The author's refusal might have led Jake to a worse situation, sleeping on the streets, which could be dangerous. \n\nThere's also the aspect of being a good friend and providing support during a crisis. Even if the author's intention was to help, the way it was handled might have been harsh. Instead of outright refusing, maybe they could have set boundaries while still offering some support. For example, allowing Jake to stay temporarily but encouraging him to seek professional help or involving other friends/family. \n\nAnother point is that the author might not have considered Jake's immediate mental health needs. Refusing without alternative support could be seen as abandoning him during a critical time. Jake's actions (taking sleeping pills) suggest he's in a state where he might need more intervention, not just being told to \"get over it.\" \n\nHowever, the author's perspective is that they were trying to be helpful by not enabling avoidance. There's a balance between helping someone through grief and pushing them to be resilient. But in this case, the author's approach might have been too strict without considering the broader support system.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author's actions might be seen as not fully supportive of Jake's needs during his time of crisis, leading to negative consequences. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
