He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend named Jake whose wife died, and he's struggling with depression. The author of the post, a friend, allowed Jake's daughter to stay but refused to let Jake himself stay over. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Jake is in a very vulnerable state, dealing with grief and possibly depression. He's showing concerning behavior like taking sleeping pills and avoiding his house. When he shows up at the author's door with his daughter, the author offers shelter to the child but not to Jake. This decision leads to Jake sleeping on the streets, which the wife is upset about.\n\nThe key points here are the author's intention versus the outcome. The author thought they were helping Jake by pushing him to cope, but the result was Jake being homeless for the night. Even if the intention was good, the outcome could be harmful. Allowing Jake to stay might have provided temporary relief and ensured his safety, especially since he's emotionally unstable. The author's refusal might have been a failure to consider Jake's mental health crisis, which is a serious issue.\n\nAdditionally, the author mentions that Jake was already drinking and possibly suicidal. In such cases, the responsibility of friends might be to ensure the person's safety, even if it means providing a place to stay. The author's wife is upset because they see the action as cruel, while the author thinks they were trying to help. But in situations involving someone's mental health and potential self-harm, the priority should be on preventing harm, even if it means making a temporary exception.\n\nSo, even though the author's intention was to help Jake move past his grief, the refusal to offer a safe place might have contributed to a dangerous situation. The author could have allowed Jake to stay, ensuring both him and his daughter were safe, and maybe set boundaries later. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't prioritize Jake's immediate well-being despite their good intentions.\n"
