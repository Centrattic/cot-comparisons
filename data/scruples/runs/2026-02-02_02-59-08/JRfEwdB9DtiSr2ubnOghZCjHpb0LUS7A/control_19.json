He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who posted this situation is at fault. The scenario is that their best friend, Jake, lost his wife and is struggling. The author says they allowed Jake's daughter to stay but not Jake himself, which led to Jake sleeping on the streets. The author's reasoning is that they wanted to help Jake move past his grief.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the emotional state of Jake. Losing a spouse is incredibly traumatic, and the fact that he's turning to drugs and is emotionally overwhelmed makes it a critical situation. The author's action was to refuse Jake staying over, possibly to push him to handle his grief. But maybe they didn't consider that Jake was in a very vulnerable state and needed immediate support, not just pushing through the pain.\n\nThen there's the part where Jake's daughter is involved. The author allowed the daughter to stay but not the father. That might be a point where the author's judgment could be questioned. A child needs a parent, especially after a traumatic event. If Jake was too unstable, maybe the right approach was to involve other resources or authorities rather than leaving him alone.\n\nAlso, the author's wife is upset, calling them an asshole. The author's intention was to help, but the outcome was Jake being left on the streets. The problem here might be the method used. Maybe there's a better way to support Jake without abandoning him. The author could have offered to let him stay for a night and also connected him with professional help or a support group instead of just turning him away.\n\nAnother angle: the author's action was based on the belief that forcing Jake to deal with his grief would help, but in reality, he might need more active support. Grief is complex, and each person handles it differently. The author might not have considered the immediate safety and well-being of Jake, especially with his daughter's presence. Even if the author's intention was good, the consequence was harmful.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author had good intentions, not allowing Jake to stay when he was in such a fragile state, leading to him sleeping on the streets, seems like a failure to provide necessary support. The author could have found another solution or at least ensured Jake had somewhere safe to be. So, they might be at fault.\n"
