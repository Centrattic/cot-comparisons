I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about unexpected guests showing up at their house. The author's partner and her family think it's a nice surprise, but the author doesn't like it because they might have things to do or need some alone time. The author mentioned that the house isn't always in order if people come unannounced. Now, the partner is upset, saying it's not fair her family can't just show up, and the author is labeled as aggressive for speaking up.\n\nHmm. First, I need to assess if the author is being unreasonable. The key points are about boundaries and mutual respect. The author shares their house with their partner, so it's a shared space. The partner's family has a habit of showing up unannounced, which the author finds disruptive. The author expressed their discomfort calmly, explaining their reasons. They didn't make a scene but set a boundary. \n\nNow, the partner and family reacted negatively, calling the author aggressive. But the author's statement seems reasonable. It's about respecting personal space and time. In relationships, especially when sharing a home, both parties should have say in how the space is used. The author isn't trying to exclude the partner's family entirely but wants to establish that unannounced visits aren't okay. The partner, however, is defending her family's behavior, which might indicate that the partner hasn't communicated this boundary to her family before. \n\nThe author's response was straightforward and not hostile. They didn't yell or accuse but explained their preferences. The fact that the partner and her family took offense suggests that maybe the family is used to having their way, and the author's boundary was a new point of contention. \n\nIn typical AITA scenarios, setting boundaries isn't usually considered the 'asshole' move. The author is standing up for their needs in a shared living space. Unless there's more context, like the author being rude or there's a history of abuse of the space, the author seems justified. The partner and family might need to adjust their behavior to respect the author's wishes. So, probably the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
