I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not liking unexpected guests, which has caused a conflict with their partner and her family.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author and their partner, along with her family, returned from Iceland and had a reserved meal to celebrate. During the meal, they discussed the partner's parents and their friends showing up unannounced. The partner and her sister think it's a nice surprise, but the author is against it because they might have things to do or need a day to themselves. The author also mentioned not wanting the house to be messy if people drop by. This led to a divide where the partner thinks it's unfair, and the author's partner's family now sees them as aggressive for expressing their opinion.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Let me think. The key points here are boundaries and communication. The author is asserting their personal boundaries about having unexpected guests, which is a reasonable stance. People have different comfort levels with social interactions, and wanting some personal space isn't unreasonable. However, the conflict arises because the partner and her family view this as a cultural or familial norm, expecting the same treatment. \n\nThe author's partner is upset because she perceives that the author is being unfair to her family, but the author is standing by their own needs. The partner's family is labeling the author as aggressive, which might be a reaction to the author finally expressing their true feelings after usually holding back. \n\nIs it fair to label the author as in the wrong here? Probably not. Everyone has the right to set boundaries in their home. The problem might lie in communication style\u2014if the author came across as harsh, but based on the description, they simply stated their preferences without aggression. The partner's family might not be used to such direct communication, leading to misunderstandings. \n\nSo, the author isn't wrong for not liking unexpected guests. They are valid in their feelings. The issue might be more about the partner and her family needing to respect the author's boundaries. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
