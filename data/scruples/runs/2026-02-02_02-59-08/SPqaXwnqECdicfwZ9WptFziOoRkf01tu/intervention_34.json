I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. The situation is that the author, their partner, and her family just came back from Iceland and had a fancy dinner. They discussed the partner's parents and friends showing up unannounced. The author expressed discomfort, mentioning needing personal time and not wanting the house messy. The partner's family is now upset, and the author is called aggressive for voicing their opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the dynamics here. The author is in a relationship and lives in a shared house. The partner's family has a cultural or habitual practice of unannounced visits. The author feels this infringes on their personal space and autonomy. The partner is defending her family's behavior, which is causing tension.\n\nThe key points are: the author communicated their discomfort, which is valid. They did so in a way that mentions their own needs (like tasks to do, needing a day to themselves), which is reasonable. The partner's family might feel disrespected or that their traditions are being challenged. The author is now labeled as aggressive, which could be a defense mechanism from the family.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, expressing a legitimate concern about personal space and boundaries isn't inherently wrong. However, the way they communicated it might have come across as harsh. The author mentions they usually bite their tongue, so this was an exception, leading to being labeled aggressive. That suggests maybe the delivery wasn't the best. But the content of the message (needing personal time) is valid. \n\nThe partner's family's reaction might be more about their own discomfort with the change in dynamics rather than the author being wrong. The author has a right to their space in a shared home. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but perhaps could have approached it more diplomatically. But given the situation, their stance is reasonable. So the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
