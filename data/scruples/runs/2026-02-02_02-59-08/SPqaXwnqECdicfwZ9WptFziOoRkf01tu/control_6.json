I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. The author's partner and her family are upset because the author expressed discomfort with surprise visits.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author and partner returned from a trip, had a fancy dinner, and discussed the partner's family habit of showing up unannounced. The author shared their preference for privacy and planning, which led to tension. The partner's family now sees the author as aggressive, even though the author usually holds back their opinions.\n\nThe key points here are about boundaries and communication. The author is asserting their right to have space and control over their home. It's common for people to have different social norms; the partner's family might see surprise visits as friendly, but the author finds it intrusive. The author didn't act out, just expressed their feelings. The partner's family's reaction seems to stem from not respecting the author's stated boundaries. \n\nThe author isn't being inconsiderate; they're communicating their needs. The partner's family's behavior of showing up without notice is the issue here. The divide comes from unmet expectations, but the author isn't wrong for wanting to establish boundaries in their shared home. So, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
