I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not liking unexpected guests, which caused a conflict with their partner and her family.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author and their partner, along with her family, came back from Iceland and had a planned meal. During the meal, they discussed the partner's parents and their friends showing up unannounced. The author expressed their dislike for this, explaining that they might have things to do and need alone time. They also mentioned not wanting the house to be messy. Now, the partner is upset, saying the family shouldn't be restricted, and the author is seen as being aggressive for sharing their opinion.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong but wants to know if that's the case. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI should consider cultural differences in social norms. In some cultures, dropping by without notice is common and seen as friendly, while in others, it's considered intrusive. The partner's family might be used to this, but the author's boundaries are valid. The author is sharing their home, so they have a right to set boundaries. However, the way the author expressed their opinion might have been abrupt, especially if they usually don't voice their opinions. The partner and family might feel disrespected if the author suddenly sets boundaries after keeping quiet. \n\nThe key here is about communication. The author didn't voice their opinions before, leading to the current situation. Now, when they do, it's causing conflict. But that doesn't mean the author is wrong for having those feelings. The issue is more about the partner's family not respecting the author's boundaries once they're set. The author is in a shared home, so their input is valid. The partner might need to mediate between family expectations and the author's needs.\n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have a right to their preferences. The problem might be more about how the message was delivered and the partner's response. The answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
