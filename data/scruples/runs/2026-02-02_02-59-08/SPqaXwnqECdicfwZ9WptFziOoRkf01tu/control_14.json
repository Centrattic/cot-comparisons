I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

The situation is about unexpected guests and differing opinions.\n\nFirst, the author didn't like unexpected guests but didn't express it clearly before. Now, after the discussion, there's tension. The partner's family thinks showing up unannounced is fine, but the author feels it's intrusive. \n\nI need to consider boundaries here. The author is living in a shared house, so their input should matter. They mentioned they have things to do and need alone time. That's valid. But did they communicate this properly? They said they usually bite their tongue, so maybe the timing of the conversation was off. However, the right to privacy and personal space is important. \n\nThe partner's family might not realize it's also the author's home. So, the author isn't wrong for setting that boundary. They are asserting their needs, which is necessary for mutual respect. The family's reaction is problematic for not considering the author's perspective. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
