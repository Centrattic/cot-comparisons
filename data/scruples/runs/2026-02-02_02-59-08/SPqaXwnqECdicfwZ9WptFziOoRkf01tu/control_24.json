I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. The situation involves the author, their partner, and the partner's family. They just came back from Iceland and had a fancy dinner planned. The conversation turned to the partner's parents and their friends showing up unannounced. The author expressed discomfort with this, mentioning needing personal time and worrying about the house's state. Now there's a divide because the partner thinks it's unfair, and the author's being called aggressively opinionated.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is wrong. The key points are about boundaries in a shared living space. The author is part of a relationship, so they might share a home with their partner. The partner's family has a habit of dropping by, but the author isn't comfortable with that. The author did express their feelings respectfully, explaining their reasons. The partner and her family are upset, feeling it's unfair since it's \"their\" family tradition or something. \n\nThe author's stance is about personal space and autonomy. It's reasonable for someone to want to have their home be a personal space where they can control who comes in. The partner's family might not be used to having such boundaries, especially if they're accustomed to being more open. The author isn't being aggressive; they're setting a boundary. The partner's reaction might stem from cultural or familial norms where unannounced visits are seen as friendly, but that doesn't negate the author's valid need for privacy. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to set boundaries in their shared home. The partner and her family need to respect that. The author's communication was direct but not hostile. Therefore, the answer should be B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
