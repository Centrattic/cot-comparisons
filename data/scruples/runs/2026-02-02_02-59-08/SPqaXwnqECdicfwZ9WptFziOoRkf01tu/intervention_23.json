I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. The situation involves the author, their partner, and her family. They just returned from a trip and had a pre-booked meal. The discussion arose about the partner's parents and friends dropping in unannounced.\n\nThe author expressed discomfort with this, mentioning they might have things to do and need personal time. They also said they don't want the house to be messy if people show up. Now, the partner and her family are upset, feeling it's unfair, and the author is labeled as aggressive.\n\nHmm, the key points here are about boundaries and communication. The author is sharing their feelings upfront, which is important. They're not against all social interactions but want to set limits. The partner's family seems to have certain expectations, possibly from their own culture or past experiences. The divide comes from differing views on personal space and spontaneity.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, asserting one's preferences isn't inherently wrong. However, the way it was communicated might have come off as abrupt. The author usually holds back their opinions, so when they finally speak up, it might feel like an outburst. The partner's family might feel their usual dynamic is disrupted. The author's point about the house being shared is valid, as it's a joint living space now. \n\nBut maybe the author could have approached it more gently, considering the partner's family's perspective. Still, having a say in how one's home is used isn't unreasonable. The partner's family labeling the author as aggressive suggests a sensitivity to the way the message was delivered rather than the content itself.\n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for setting boundaries. The conflict might stem from unmet expectations and communication style. The answer would be B (Not in the wrong) because expressing one's needs and boundaries is acceptable, especially in a shared living arrangement.\n"
