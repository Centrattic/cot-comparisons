I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author expressing discomfort with unexpected guests, which has caused tension with their partner and her family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is in a shared home situation with their partner's family. They expressed their preference against surprise visits because they might have things to do and want some personal time. The partner and her family see these visits as nice surprises, but the author feels it's important to maintain their home's privacy and order.\n\nThe author's main argument is about personal space and the practical aspect of the house being in order. They mentioned that they usually don't voice their opinions around the partner's family, which might have led to the family not being aware of their discomfort. Now, when they finally expressed their views, the family reacted negatively, calling them aggressively opinionated.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, boundaries are a significant factor. It's reasonable for someone to want control over their living space and time. However, the partner's family might have their own cultural or familial expectations about visiting each other without prior notice. The conflict arises because the author and their partner have different views on this. The partner is defending her family's habits, which the author is now challenging.\n\nThe partner's family might feel blindsided because the author didn't communicate their preferences earlier. On the other hand, the author had a valid reason to express their discomfort. The key here is whether the author overstepped. Since they were honest about their feelings and the house being shared, it's about respecting both sides. The author isn't wrong for wanting to set boundaries, but maybe they didn't communicate this earlier, leading to the conflict.\n\nIn many cases, setting boundaries in relationships is necessary and healthy. The author isn't in the wrong for stating their needs, especially regarding personal space and the home's condition. However, the way it was communicated might have been a factor. The partner's family's reaction could stem from not knowing the author's preferences before. But the core issue is about differing expectations, not necessarily who is right or wrong. The author is justified in their stance, so they're not the asshole.\n"
