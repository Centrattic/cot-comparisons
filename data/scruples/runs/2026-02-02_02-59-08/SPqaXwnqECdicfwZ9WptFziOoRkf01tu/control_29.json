I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. The situation involves the author's partner and her family who are used to dropping by each other's houses as a surprise. The author expressed discomfort with this, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author shares a home with their partner, so the house is a shared space. The author's main points are about needing personal time and not wanting the house to be in disarray when unexpected guests arrive. They did express their feelings calmly, according to the post, but the partner's family now sees them as aggressively opinionated.\n\nThe partner's side is that it's not fair to restrict family from showing up whenever. The key here is mutual respect in a shared living situation. The author has a right to their personal space and preferences. It's reasonable to set boundaries, especially if the house is a joint responsibility. The author isn't being hostile; they're stating their needs. The partner's family might need to adjust their expectations since they now live with someone who has different social preferences. The author isn't wrong for asserting their boundaries. So, answer B (Not in the wrong) makes sense here.\n"
