I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author, their partner, and the partner's family. They came back from Iceland, had a fancy dinner, and discussed the partner's parents and friends showing up unannounced. The author expressed dislike for unexpected guests because they might need to do things or want alone time, and mentioned not wanting the house to be messy. The partner and her family are upset, saying the author is being aggressive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider boundaries. When you live with someone, especially their family, setting boundaries is normal. The author is stating their preference without being confrontational. They explained their reasons\u2014personal time and house condition. The partner's family might expect flexibility since it's \"their house,\" but the author is asserting their own space. \n\nCultural differences could play a role. Maybe the partner's family is used to more open house policies. However, the author didn't overreact; they just expressed their discomfort. The partner is caught between family and partner, which is tough, but the author's stance is reasonable. \n\nUninvited guests can be stressful. The author isn't refusing all visitors but is asking for consideration. The family labeling the author as \"aggressively opinionated\" seems harsh, especially since the author usually holds back their opinions. It's about mutual respect and understanding each other's needs. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They're setting healthy boundaries. The answer should be B.\n"
