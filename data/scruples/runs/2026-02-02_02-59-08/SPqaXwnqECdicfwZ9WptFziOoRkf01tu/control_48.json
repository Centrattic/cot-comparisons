I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not liking unexpected guests, which is causing a conflict with their partner and her family.\n\nFirst, the author and their partner had a pre-booked fancy dinner after a trip. During the meal, the topic of the partner's parents and friends showing up unannounced came up. The partner and her sister think it's a nice surprise, but the author disagrees. They expressed that they don't like it because they might have things to do or need alone time, and also mentioned not wanting the house to be messy if guests come unannounced. This led to a divide, with the partner saying it's unfair and the author's partner's family labeling them as aggressive.\n\nNow, considering social norms, people have different boundaries. It's common for some to dislike unexpected visitors because it disrupts their personal time or space. The author made their feelings known calmly, pointing out that the house is shared and they need their space sometimes. The partner and her family's reaction seems to be more about not understanding or respecting those boundaries. The author isn't being aggressive without cause; they're asserting their needs. The partner's family's label of \"aggressively opinionated\" might stem from their own expectations not aligning with the author's, but that doesn't make the author wrong. \n\nIn relationships, especially with blended families, it's important to communicate boundaries. The author did that, and while it caused a conflict, the root issue is about differing expectations. The author isn't in the wrong for expressing their need for personal space. The partner and her family need to adjust their behavior, but the author's stance is reasonable. So, the answer should be B.\n"
