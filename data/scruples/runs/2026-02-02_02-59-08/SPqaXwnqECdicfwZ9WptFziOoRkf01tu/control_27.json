I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is in a relationship where their partner's family is used to dropping by unannounced. The author and their partner just came back from a trip, and they had a planned fancy dinner. During the meal, the topic of uninvited guests came up. The partner and her sister like the surprise visits, but the author doesn't. The author expressed that they don't like it because they might have things to do or need alone time, and they don't want the house to be messy if someone shows up. Now, the partner is upset, saying it's not fair, and the author's opinion has led to being seen as aggressive by the in-laws.\n\nFirst, the author is sharing their boundaries. They have a right to want privacy and to have their space respected. It's not unreasonable for someone to want to have their home be a place where they can control who is there, especially after a trip when they might need downtime. The author's partner's family's behavior is about their own expectations, but the author is asserting their own needs. \n\nThe partner is taking it as an issue of fairness, implying that her family should be able to visit as they please. But the author is pointing out that this is their shared home, so the family should consider both parties' preferences. The fact that the author usually holds back their opinions but this time spoke up might have caught the family off guard, leading them to label the author as aggressive. However, setting boundaries is not aggression; it's about mutual respect. \n\nThe key points here are the right to privacy, setting personal boundaries, and mutual respect in a shared living space. The author isn't wrong to express their discomfort with unannounced visits. The partner's family's expectations don't outweigh the author's need for personal space. So the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
