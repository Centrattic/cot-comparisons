I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in a situation involving unexpected guests. The author's partner and her family seem to think it's okay to show up unannounced, but the author doesn't like it. The author expressed their dislike, and now the family is upset, calling them aggressive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. In some cultures, dropping by unexpectedly is common and seen as friendly. The author mentions their partner and her sister agree it's a nice surprise, so maybe that's their family's norm. But the author doesn't like it, possibly because they prefer privacy or have things to do. The author's response was to state their preference, which is reasonable. They mentioned not wanting the house to be in a mess and needing personal days. That's a valid point about boundaries and personal space.\n\nThe partner is mediating here, saying it's not fair the author is objecting. The author counters by saying the house is shared. The family labels the author as aggressive for not biting their tongue. The key here is whether expressing a preference in a shared living situation is being in the wrong. \n\nThe author didn't prevent the family from visiting, just expressed discomfort. It's about communication and mutual respect. The family might not realize the author's perspective. The author's right to have boundaries in their own home is important. However, the divide suggests possible miscommunication. But the question is if the author is in the wrong. I think not. They're not being unreasonable for wanting to set limits. So the answer should be B.\n"
