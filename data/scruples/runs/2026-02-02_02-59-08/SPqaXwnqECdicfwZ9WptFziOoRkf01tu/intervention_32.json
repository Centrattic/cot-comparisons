I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. The situation involves the author, their partner, and the partner's family. They came back from a trip and discussed how the partner's family and parents just show up unannounced. The author expressed discomfort with this, saying they might have things to do or need alone time, and mentioned not wanting the house to be messy. This led to a conflict where the partner and her family think it's unfair, while the author is labeled as aggressive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a right to their personal space and time. It's reasonable to set boundaries about unexpected guests, especially if it affects their ability to work or relax. The partner's family might have different social norms where dropping by is seen as friendly. However, respecting each other's living space is crucial in a relationship. The author isn't wrong for wanting to maintain that boundary. The partner and her family might not realize how their actions infringe on the author's needs. The key here is mutual respect for each other's preferences. Since the author communicated their feelings calmly and gave examples (like needing to do things or have a day to themselves), they haven't overstepped. The label of \"aggressively opinionated\" from the partner's parents seems unfair if the author was just stating their boundaries. So, the author isn't in the wrong; they're setting necessary boundaries. Answer B.\n"
