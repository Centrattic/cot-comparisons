I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about unexpected guests and the resulting conflict between the author, their partner, and her family.\n\nFirst, I need to understand all the details. The author and their partner came back from Iceland, had a fancy dinner, and discussed the partner's parents and friends dropping by without notice. The author expressed discomfort with this, explaining they might have things to do or need alone time. They also mentioned not wanting the house to be messy if someone shows up. This led to a divide, with the partner saying it's unfair, and the author's partner's family calling them aggressively opinionated because they usually don't voice their opinions.\n\nSo the key points here are about boundaries and differing expectations. The author is asserting their right to privacy and personal space, which is a common concern. The partner's family is used to a more open, spontaneous style of socializing, which is also valid in many cultures. The conflict arises from clashing norms.\n\nThe author's position is that the house is shared, so their preferences matter. The partner and family feel it's unfair to restrict their spontaneous visits. The author didn't express this before, so the partner and family might feel blindsided. But the author is now setting boundaries after being uncomfortable for a while.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author might have been holding back their true feelings, leading to an outburst that felt aggressive. However, it's also important to respect each other's needs. The partner's family might not consider the author's perspective, assuming the house is open for visits. The author is now making their needs known, which is a healthy step, but maybe the timing or the way it was presented caused the conflict.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, they have a legitimate need for personal space and privacy. It's their house too, so they should be able to set boundaries. However, the way they expressed their feelings might have come off as abrupt if they hadn't communicated this before. But since they mentioned they usually bite their tongue, maybe this was a necessary moment to speak up. \n\nIn many cases, people appreciate knowing their partner's boundaries, even if it changes the dynamic. The partner's family might need to adjust, but the author isn't wrong for asserting their own needs. So I think the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
