I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the person and their partner are returning from Iceland and had a planned fancy dinner. They discussed how the partner's family sometimes shows up unannounced at each other's houses. The author expressed that they don't like unexpected guests, explaining they might have things to do and need alone time. The partner and her family now think the author is being too harsh, especially since the author usually doesn't voice opinions around the partner's family.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about setting boundaries in a shared living space. The author is stating their preference for not having surprise guests, which is a reasonable request. The partner's family, on the other hand, sees this as a cultural or habitual practice. \n\nThe author's argument is that it's their house too, so they have the right to set boundaries. The partner is caught in the middle, thinking it's unfair that her family can't just drop by. The author's response was to express their dislike and the potential for the house not being in order, which is a valid concern. \n\nNow, is the author wrong? Well, expressing a preference for personal space and planning is not inherently wrong. People have different needs for privacy and alone time. The issue arises if the author is being inflexible or uncommunicative, but in this case, they did communicate their feelings. The partner's family might be used to different social norms where unannounced visits are common, but that doesn't make the author's stance wrong. It's about mutual respect and understanding each other's boundaries. \n\nThe author is in the right to set those boundaries, especially since it's their shared home. The partner's family's reaction of labeling the author as \"aggressively opinionated\" seems dismissive of the author's valid concerns. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong here.\n"
