I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation involves an argument between the author, their partner, and the partner's family over unexpected guests.\n\nFirst, the author and partner returned from a trip and had a pre-booked meal. During the meal, the topic came up about the partner's parents and friends showing up unannounced. The partner and her sister like these surprises, but the author doesn't. The author explained that they don't want people showing up without notice because they might have things to do or need alone time, and also mentioned the house being in a state. This caused a divide, with the partner feeling it's unfair and the author's house being a point of contention. The family labeled the author as aggressive for speaking up.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know others' opinions. The answer needs to be A or B. \n\nI need to consider boundaries in relationships. When someone is in a relationship, especially with a partner's family, it's important to communicate needs. The author expressed their discomfort, which is valid. The partner's family might be used to certain social norms, but that doesn't mean the author shouldn't voice their preferences. The author's house is their space, so they have the right to set boundaries. The partner's reaction suggests she might not see the need for these boundaries, but that doesn't make the author wrong. The key here is whether expressing a preference without being hostile is wrong. The author didn't act out, just stated their opinion. The family's label of \"aggressively opinionated\" seems unfair if the author was just being honest. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
