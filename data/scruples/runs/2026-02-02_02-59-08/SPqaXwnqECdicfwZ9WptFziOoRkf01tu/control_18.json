I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about unexpected guests. The author's partner and her family think it's nice to drop by each other's houses as a surprise, but the author doesn't like that. They were discussing it after a trip, and the author expressed not liking it because they might have other plans or need some alone time. The partner is upset, saying it's not fair, and the author is now seen as being \"aggressively opinionated\" by the in-laws.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author is at fault here. The key points are about personal boundaries and differing expectations. The author has a right to their own space and preferences. It's common for people to have different comfort levels with unexpected visits. The partner's family might be used to a more open, flexible lifestyle, but the author values having control over their schedule and environment. \n\nThe author didn't act out or be rude; they calmly explained their feelings. The conflict arose because the partner and her family didn't consider the author's perspective. The author's statement about the house being as much theirs as the partner's is valid\u2014it's a shared space, so both parties should respect each other's needs.\n\nThe in-laws labeling the author as \"aggressively opinionated\" seems like a misinterpretation. The author was expressing their opinion respectfully. The real issue here is the clash of expectations. The author isn't wrong for setting boundaries. They have the right to their own space and should be heard. The partner needs to bridge the gap by communicating and respecting both sides. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
