I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. The situation involves the author's partner and her family. They just came back from a trip and had a meal discussing how the parents and friends surprise each other at home. The partner and her sister like the surprise visits, but the author doesn't. He expressed his discomfort, mentioning needing time to himself and not wanting the house to be messy. Now, the partner is upset, saying it's unfair, and the parents think he's being aggressive.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The key points are communication, boundaries, and mutual respect. The author is part of the household, so his opinion matters. He's not being hostile, just setting boundaries. The partner's family has their own habits, but they need to consider the author's needs too. The author didn't act out of aggression but rather explained his reasons calmly. The divide happened because the partner's family didn't expect his resistance. The author is standing up for his own space, which is reasonable. So, the answer would probably be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. He's just asserting his needs in a shared living space.\n"
