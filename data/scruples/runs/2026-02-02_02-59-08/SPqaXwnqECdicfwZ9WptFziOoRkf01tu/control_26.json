I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about unexpected guests. The author, their partner, and her family just came back from Iceland and had a booked fancy meal. They were discussing how the partner's parents and their friends surprise each other by showing up unannounced. The author didn't like that idea, explaining they might be busy or need alone time and that the house might not be ready. The partner and sister think it's a nice surprise, but the author's opinion caused a divide. The partner's family now sees the author as aggressively opinionated.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. In some cultures, dropping by unannounced is common, but in others, it's considered rude. The author is expressing discomfort, which is valid. They shared their feelings calmly, stating their need for personal time and the state of the house. The author isn't being aggressive, just setting boundaries. The partner's family taking offense might be because they're used to a different norm. The author has a right to their space, especially in a shared home. The partner's family shouldn't feel entitled to drop by without notice. The author isn't wrong for asserting their preferences. So, the answer is B.\n"
