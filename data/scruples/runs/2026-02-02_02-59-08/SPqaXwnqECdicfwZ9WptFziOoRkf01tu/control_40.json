I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about unexpected guests. The author's partner and her family are okay with showing up unannounced, but the author isn't. They had a disagreement after a trip where they discussed this. The partner's family is now upset, calling the author aggressive.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author did something wrong. The key points are that the author expressed their dislike for unexpected guests, which is something they've usually kept to themselves. The partner is upset because her family feels it's unfair, and the author is defending their right to the house. \n\nThe author's reasoning is about having personal time and not wanting the house in disarray. That seems reasonable. People have different boundaries, and it's important to respect them. The partner's family might not have considered the author's perspective before. \n\nHowever, the author admitted to usually biting their tongue, which might mean they haven't communicated their feelings clearly before. But in this case, they finally spoke up, which is understandable. The partner's family taking offense might be their own issue for not respecting boundaries. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for expressing their feelings. It's their home too, and it's valid to set boundaries. The partner and her family need to adjust, not the author. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
