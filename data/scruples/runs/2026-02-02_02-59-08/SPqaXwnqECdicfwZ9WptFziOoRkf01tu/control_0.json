I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. \n\nSo, the situation is that the author, their partner, and the partner's family came back from Iceland and had a fancy dinner. During the meal, they discussed the partner's parents and their friends showing up unannounced. The partner and her sister like these surprise visits, but the author doesn't. The author explained that they might have things to do or need a day to themselves and that they don't want the house to be messy if someone shows up without notice. Now, there's a divide because the partner feels it's unfair, and the author's opinion is causing tension, with the partner's parents labeling the author as aggressive.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about boundaries and communication. The author is expressing their discomfort with unexpected guests, which is a common issue. They mentioned that they usually hold back their opinions around the partner's family, but in this case, they voiced their disagreement. The partner and her family might see this as being too direct, especially since the author didn't express this before. \n\nBut the author's main point is about personal space and preparedness. Not wanting strangers to show up unannounced is a valid concern. Everyone has the right to their own space and privacy. The fact that the author is part of the household now (since it's mentioned as \"my house as it hers\") implies shared responsibility for the space. Therefore, the author's preference should be considered. However, the way the author expressed their opinion might have been abrupt, especially if they hadn't discussed this before. The partner's family might feel blindsided, leading to the label of being \"aggressively opinionated.\" \n\nBut is expressing a legitimate concern about privacy and personal time being in the wrong? The author isn't doing anything harmful; they're just stating their boundaries. The partner's family might have different social norms, but that doesn't mean the author is wrong. It's possible that the partner hasn't communicated this to her family before, leading to a clash of expectations now. \n\nThe author's response was to state their feelings, which is reasonable. The problem might be more about the partner's family not respecting the author's perspective, or the partner not mediating the discussion. The label of \"aggressively opinionated\" could be a deflection from the family having to adjust their behavior. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is not in the wrong for expressing their need for personal space and boundaries, especially in their shared home. They are advocating for themselves, which is appropriate. The partner's family might need to adjust their expectations, but that doesn't make the author wrong. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
