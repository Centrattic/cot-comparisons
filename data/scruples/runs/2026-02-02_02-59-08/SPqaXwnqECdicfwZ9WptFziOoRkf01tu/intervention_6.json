I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted the story is in the wrong. The situation is about unexpected guests. The author, their partner, and the partner's family just came back from Iceland and had a meal planned. The partner's family and friends drop in unannounced as a surprise. The author didn't like this, mentioned they like some alone time and not wanting to be disturbed. The partner is upset, saying it's unfair, and the author is now called aggressively opinionated.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is at fault. First, I need to consider cultural norms. In some cultures, dropping by unannounced is common and seen as friendly. In others, it's considered rude. The partner's family might come from a culture where this is normal. However, the author has a valid point about needing personal space and not wanting to be interrupted. The author's home is a shared space, so they have a right to set boundaries.\n\nThe author expressed their feelings calmly, stating they prefer not to have unexpected guests because of tasks or needing alone time. That seems reasonable. The partner's family might not have considered the author's perspective, assuming their way is the norm. The partner is now taking sides, which could be because she's used to her family's habits and doesn't see the issue. The author is defending their personal space, which is a legitimate need.\n\nBut maybe the author could have addressed this earlier, before the situation escalated. However, the story mentions that the author usually holds their tongue, so this might be the first time expressing concerns. It's possible the partner's family hasn't been given this feedback before, leading to the misunderstanding.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for expressing their valid need for personal space. They are setting boundaries in a shared living situation, which is important. The partner and her family might need to adjust their behavior, but the author isn't at fault here. The answer should be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
