I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask.

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is at fault (AITA) for not liking unexpected guests. The situation is that the author, their partner, and her family were on a trip to Iceland and had a pre-booked fancy dinner. During the meal, the conversation turned to the partner's parents and their friends showing up unannounced. The partner and her sister think it's a nice surprise, but the author expressed discomfort, mentioning wanting to keep the house in order and sometimes needing alone time. Now there's a divide because the partner's family is upset, and the author is seen as aggressive for not biting their tongue.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural differences. In some cultures, dropping by unexpectedly is a normal part of social interaction, but in others, it's considered impolite. The partner's family seems to come from a background where surprise visits are acceptable, so the author's refusal might clash with their expectations. However, the author is the one living in the house and has a right to set boundaries. \n\nThe key points here are the author's right to privacy and personal space versus the partner's family's social norms. The author explained their reasons clearly\u2014needing to do things, wanting alone time, and maintaining the house. These are valid concerns. But the way they communicated it might have come off as harsh, especially if the partner's family isn't used to being told no. The phrase \"I wouldn't want the house to be in a state\" could imply that the family's presence would make the house messy, which might be a sensitive point. \n\nThe partner's family labeling the author as \"aggressively opinionated\" suggests that the author might have overstepped in the way they expressed their views, even if the content was reasonable. It's possible that the author could have handled the conversation differently, perhaps by acknowledging the family's perspective first before stating their own. However, the core issue is the author's right to their own space. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, it's often about balance. While it's important to respect family traditions, the author's needs are also legitimate. The partner's family might need to adjust their expectations if they are living in a shared space. The author isn't wrong for having preferences, but maybe the communication could have been smoother. \n\nBut the partner is saying it's unfair that the family can't just drop by. The author is asserting their ownership of the house, which is a home for both. So the author isn't wrong for setting boundaries. The partner's family might be in the wrong for not respecting those boundaries. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they have the right to their own space and expressed their concerns, even if the delivery was a bit blunt. The family's expectations need to adapt if they're part of the household now.\n"
