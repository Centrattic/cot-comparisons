I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not liking unexpected guests, especially after coming back from a trip. The partner's family is used to dropping by, and the author expressed their discomfort, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author is in a relationship with someone whose family has different social norms. The author's house is shared, so they have a right to set boundaries. They mentioned not wanting people to show up unannounced because they might be busy or need alone time. The partner's family took offense, seeing it as the author being aggressive.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, setting boundaries in a shared living space is reasonable. The author isn't saying they can't have guests ever, just that unexpected visits are an issue. The partner's family might not realize that this is a boundary, so the author isn't wrong for stating their needs. The conflict arises from differing expectations, not from the author being in the wrong. The author's reaction is about respecting their own space, which is valid. The partner's family's response is more about them not respecting the author's boundaries. So, the answer should be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They're standing up for their needs, which is important in any relationship.\n"
