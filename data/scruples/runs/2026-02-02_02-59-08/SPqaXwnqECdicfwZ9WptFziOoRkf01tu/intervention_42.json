I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not liking unexpected guests, which caused a divide with their partner and her family.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author, their partner, and the partner's family were discussing the habit of showing up unannounced at each other's homes. The author expressed their dislike for this because they might have things to do and need personal time, also mentioning the house state. The partner and her family see it as a nice surprise, but the author's comments led to conflict. The partner feels it's unfair, and the in-laws think the author is being too aggressive.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is at fault, but I need to evaluate. The author is in a shared home situation. Expressing boundaries is generally okay. People have different social norms; some cultures or families are more casual about unannounced visits. The author's point about needing personal time is valid. However, the way it's communicated might matter. The author said they usually hold back, so this was a rare time they spoke up, which led to being labeled as aggressive. Maybe the partner and her family weren't expecting that. \n\nIs expressing a preference for not having unexpected guests wrong? I don't think so. The author has a right to their space and time. The problem might be on the partner and family's side for not respecting that boundary. The author's partner is defending her family's habits, but the house is shared, so both sides need to consider each other's preferences. The author isn't wrong for setting a boundary. The partner's family might be missing the author's perspective. \n\nSo the answer would be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). The author is justified in wanting to set boundaries, especially in a shared living space. The conflict arises from differing expectations, but the author isn't at fault for stating their needs.\n"
