I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted about not liking unexpected guests is in the wrong (AITA). The situation involves them, their partner, and her family. They had a pre-booked meal after a trip, discussed the family habit of showing up unannounced, and the user expressed discomfort with it. The partner and family disagree, leading to tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the user's perspective. They mentioned not being a fan of unexpected guests because they might have things to do or need personal time. They also mentioned the house being in order if someone shows up. That seems like a valid concern about personal space and privacy. \n\nOn the other hand, the partner and her family see surprise visits as a nice gesture. The user's response might be seen as being closed off or not flexible. However, the user is part of the household now, so their feelings about their home should be considered. The key point here is mutual respect. The user has the right to set boundaries in their shared home, especially if it's causing them stress. \n\nThe partner's family's reaction to the user being labeled as \"aggressively opinionated\" suggests a possible lack of understanding. The user didn't attack them but shared their preferences. The conflict arises from differing social norms. The user isn't wrong for advocating for their needs. It's about balancing both parties' needs. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), because the user isn't wrong for expressing their discomfort and setting boundaries in their shared home. The partner's family needs to respect the user's limits as well.\n"
