I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about unexpected guests. The author's partner and her family think showing up unannounced is a nice surprise, but the author doesn't like it. The author mentioned that they might have things to do and sometimes need a day to themselves, and worried about the house being messy. The partner is upset because she feels her family can't just show up, and the author's partner's parents think the author is being aggressive for finally expressing their opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a right to their personal space and time, right? If someone shows up unannounced, it can be stressful, especially if you're trying to do things or relax. The author's partner and family might see it as a harmless surprise, but that doesn't mean the author's feelings are invalid. The key here is about boundaries. The author is stating their boundaries, which is important in any relationship. It's not unreasonable to want some privacy or time without guests.\n\nOn the other hand, the partner's family might have different social norms. In some cultures or families, dropping by without notice is common and seen as a sign of closeness. But that doesn't mean the author has to accept it if it's causing them stress. The author's point about the house being in a state is also valid\u2014people might not want others to see their home in a messy state, which is a reasonable concern.\n\nThe partner's reaction might stem from feeling that her family's traditions are being criticized. However, the author is not attacking the family; they're expressing their own preferences. The author's partner needs to balance her family's habits with her partner's needs. The fact that the author usually holds back their opinions and only spoke up this time might have caught the family off guard, but that doesn't make the author wrong for finally sharing their feelings.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. It's important for all parties to respect each other's preferences. The partner and her family need to understand that the author has different social needs. The author's partner might need to mediate to find a compromise, like giving advance notice or respecting the author's space when they're not available. But the author isn't wrong for expressing their discomfort.\n"
