I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is at fault for not liking unexpected guests. The situation involves the author, their partner, and the partner's family. They came back from Iceland and had a pre-booked meal. The partner's family often visits without notice, and the author expressed discomfort with this, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author shares a home with their partner, so their living space should be respected. The partner's family showing up unannounced could be seen as respecting the home as a shared space versus the partner's family's traditions. The author's main concerns are about having time to themselves and ensuring the house is presentable, which are reasonable personal boundaries.\n\nThe partner is upset that the author didn't like the surprise visits, and the in-laws feel the author is being too direct. But the author's house is as much theirs as the partner's, so having a say in how it's used makes sense. Expressing their feelings clearly isn't aggression if it's about setting boundaries. The partner's family might not be aware of these boundaries, but the author isn't wrong for establishing them. \n\nIn terms of social norms, being a guest usually involves respecting the host's space and schedule. Since the partner's family isn't the primary residents, they should consider the author's needs. The author isn't at fault for advocating for their own space. The conflict here is more about differing expectations and communication styles. The answer would likely be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
