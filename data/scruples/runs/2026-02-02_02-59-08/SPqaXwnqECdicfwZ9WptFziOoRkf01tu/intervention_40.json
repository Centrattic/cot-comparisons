I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about unexpected guests showing up at their house.\n\nThe author, along with their partner and her family, just came back from Iceland and had a meal. During that meal, they discussed the partner's parents and their friends surprising each other at homes. The partner and her sister like it, but the author doesn't. The author expressed that they don't like it because they might be busy or need alone time and don't want the house to be messy if someone shows up unannounced. This caused a divide because the partner thinks her family can just show up, but the author says it's their house too. Now the partner's parents are calling the author aggressively opinionated.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know the opinion. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around house guests. In many cultures, it's common to announce visits in advance so the host can prepare. Surprises can be inconvenient, especially if the host isn't expecting company. The author clearly communicated their discomfort, which is valid. People have different boundaries about personal space and time. The partner's family might not be used to that, but the author's house is shared, so their wishes should count. However, communication style matters. Did the author express their feelings respectfully? The post mentions they usually bite their tongue, so this might have been the first time they spoke up. That could have caused a shock to the partner and her family, leading to the conflict. But the author's reasons are reasonable. The partner might need to mediate between her family's habits and the author's needs. The key is mutual respect. If the author made their stance clear without aggression, they're not in the wrong. The partner's family might need to adjust, but the author's right to set boundaries is valid. So, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
