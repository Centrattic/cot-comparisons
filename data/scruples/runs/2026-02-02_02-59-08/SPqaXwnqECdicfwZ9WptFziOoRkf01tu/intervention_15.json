I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. The scenario involves the author, their partner, and her family. They're coming back from a trip and had a planned dinner. The conversation turned into a conflict about surprise visits.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. In some cultures, dropping by unannounced is normal, but others might find it intrusive. The author's partner and her family see it as a nice surprise, but the author disagrees. The main issue is boundaries. The author has a right to their own space and privacy, especially in their home. They explained they need time to themselves and that the house shouldn't be in disarray. That's valid. \n\nThe partner is upset, feeling it's unfair the family can't just visit, but the author emphasizes it's their home too. The parents labeled the author as aggressive for speaking up. However, the author was expressing their feelings calmly, not being aggressive. The partner might not have considered the author's perspective before. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Probably not. They have a right to set boundaries. The problem might be more on the partner's side for not respecting those boundaries. The author was honest about their preferences, which is healthy. The partner and family might need to adjust their expectations. \n\nSo, answer B (the author is not in the wrong). The key points are the right to privacy, communication of needs, and the partner's family not respecting that. The author's stance is reasonable.\n"
