I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see here. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about unexpected guests showing up at their house. The writer, along with their partner and her family, just returned from Iceland and had a fancy dinner booked. The partner's parents and their friends often drop by each other's houses as surprises. The writer expressed that they don't like this because they might have things to do or need a day alone, and they don't want the house to be messy if someone shows up unannounced. The partner's family is now upset, calling the writer aggressively opinionated, and the partner says it's not fair.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the writer is in the wrong. The user thinks they are, but I need to evaluate it. Let's break it down. The writer is sharing their personal preference about not liking unexpected guests. That's a common issue. People have different boundaries. The partner's family has a different cultural or personal norm of dropping by without prior notice. The writer is in a shared living space (the house is \"just as much mine as it is hers\"), so they have a right to their own comfort and privacy. Expressing that dislike isn't inherently wrong. The problem here might be communication. The partner feels it's unfair, but the writer had previously bitten their tongue, so this might be the first time they voiced their opinion. The family's reaction seems harsh\u2014labeling them as aggressively opinionated. It's possible that the family didn't expect this stance and took it personally. However, the writer is setting a boundary, which is important in relationships. The key is whether the writer's stance is reasonable. Since they provided a valid reason (personal time, house state), they aren't necessarily in the wrong. The partner's family might need to adjust their behavior, but the writer is justified in expressing their needs. So, the answer might be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
