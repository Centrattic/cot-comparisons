I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about unexpected guests.\n\nThe author, their partner, and her family came back from Iceland and had a fancy dinner planned. They discussed how the partner's parents and friends just show up unannounced. The author didn't like that, explaining they might need time to themselves or have things to do. The partner and her sister thought it's a nice surprise, but the partner is now upset that her family can't just drop by. The author says the house is theirs, so they should consider that. The partner's family labeled the author as aggressive for not biting their tongue.\n\nSo, the question is: is the author in the wrong? The user initially thought the author was wrong but wants to know others' opinions. I need to decide between A (Yes) or B (No).\n\nFirst, the key points. The author expressed their discomfort with unexpected guests, which is a valid personal boundary. The partner's family has a different expectation, which can lead to conflict. The author didn't act out; they just stated their opinion. The partner's family reacted negatively, calling them aggressive, which might be an overreaction. The author's argument that the house is shared is reasonable. Boundaries are important in relationships, especially when it comes to personal space. The author isn't being mean; they're setting limits. The partner's family's surprise visits might be considered inconsiderate if they don't consider the other person's needs. So, the author is standing up for their needs, which is not being in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
