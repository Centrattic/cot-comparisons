I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The main issue is about unexpected guests.\n\nSo, the person and their partner came back from a trip and had a planned dinner. During the meal, the partner's family talks about just showing up at each other's houses as a surprise. The author expresses that they don't like this because they might have things to do and need personal time, and they don't want the house to look messy. Now, the partner and her family are upset, saying it's not fair and that the author is being too aggressive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has every right to set boundaries, especially in their own home. If they share the house with their partner, it's reasonable to expect that they can have control over who enters without notice. The partner's family might come from a culture or family dynamic where unannounced visits are common, but that doesn't mean the author has to accept it if they're uncomfortable.\n\nThe key points here are: the author communicated their feelings calmly and clearly. They mentioned they need personal time and the house should be presentable. The partner's side is taking offense, possibly because they're not used to such boundaries. The author isn't being aggressive; they're stating their needs. The label of \"aggressively opinionated\" might be a misinterpretation from the partner's family, who might not realize the author's perspective.\n\nAlso, the fact that the author usually holds back their opinions but now expressed them could make it seem more confrontational to the family. However, it's their right to express their feelings, especially in their own home. The divide is more about differing expectations and boundaries rather than the author being wrong.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they're asserting their right to privacy and personal space, which is valid. The conflict arises from a mismatch in expectations, not from the author's wrongdoing.\n"
