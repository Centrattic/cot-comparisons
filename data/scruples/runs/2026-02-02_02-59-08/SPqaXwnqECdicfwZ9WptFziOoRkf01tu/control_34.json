      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong.\n\nSo the situation is about unexpected guests. The author, their partner, and the partner's family just came back from Iceland and had a nice meal at a fancy restaurant. Then they discussed the partner's parents and friends showing up unannounced as a surprise. The partner and her sister like that, but the author doesn't. The author expressed that they don't like it because they might have things to do and need some alone time. They also mentioned not wanting the house to be messy if someone shows up. This caused a divide with the partner saying it's unfair, and the author's partner's family now thinks the author is being aggressive for finally expressing their opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The main issue here is about boundaries and differing expectations in a shared living situation. The author is part of a couple, so the house is shared. They have a right to their own space and preferences. The partner's family's habit of showing up unannounced might be a cultural or family norm, but it's causing conflict now.\n\nThe author expressed their dislike calmly, explaining their reasons. They didn't say anything aggressive, just stated their preferences. The partner and family are taking offense, labeling the author as \"aggressively opinionated\" even though the author usually holds back their opinions. So the author is finally asserting their own needs, which is reasonable. The partner's family might not be used to having their habits challenged, so the conflict arises from differing expectations in a shared household.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about mutual respect. The author has the right to set boundaries about their living space. Expecting others to respect your space is reasonable. The partner's family might need to adjust their behavior if it's causing discomfort. The author isn't in the wrong for setting these boundaries. The problem is that the partner and family aren't respecting the author's perspective, not the other way around.\n\nSo the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
