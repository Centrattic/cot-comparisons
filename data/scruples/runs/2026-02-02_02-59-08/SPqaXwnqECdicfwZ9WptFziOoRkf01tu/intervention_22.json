I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about unexpected guests. The author, their partner, and the partner's family just came back from Iceland and had a fancy dinner planned. During that meal, the topic came up about the partner's parents and their friends showing up as surprises. The partner and her sister like it, but the author doesn't. He expressed that he's not a fan because he might have things to do or needs a day to himself, and also mentioned the house might not be in order if people show up unannounced.\n\nNow, this caused some conflict because the partner thinks it's unfair that her family can't just drop by, and the author's response led to being labeled as aggressive. The user is asking if the author is at fault here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is living with the partner, so the house is shared. The author has a valid point about needing personal space and time, which is a common concern. However, the way it was communicated might be part of the problem. The author mentioned that he usually doesn't share his opinions around the partner's family, so maybe he came off as too direct or confrontational when he finally spoke up.\n\nThe partner's family might be used to being able to drop by without prior notice, so the author's statement could have been a surprise to them. The key here is whether the author's expression was reasonable. He did state his preferences calmly, but the partner's side is taking it as a problem. The partner's family might feel their traditions or expectations are being challenged.\n\nBut from another angle, the author is also entitled to his boundaries. If the house is shared, the author's input is valid. The partner's family shouldn't assume they can visit without notice, especially if it's causing discomfort. The issue here is about communication and mutual respect. The author isn't doing anything wrong by setting boundaries, but perhaps the way he communicated it could be improved. However, the main question is whether he's in the wrong, not just the communication style.\n\nThe user initially thought the author might be in the wrong but is unsure. The author is standing up for his space, which is reasonable. The partner's family's reaction might stem from not being used to such boundaries. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. The problem is more about differing expectations and the need for clearer communication from both sides. The author isn't wrong for expressing his needs; the partner's family might need to adjust their behavior. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
