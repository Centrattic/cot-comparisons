I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. The situation involves the author, their partner, and the partner's family. They had a discussion after returning from a trip about the partner's parents and friends showing up unannounced. The author expressed discomfort with this, explaining they need some time to themselves and that the house might not always be presentable. The partner and her family are upset, saying it's unfair, and the author is now seen as aggressive by the in-laws.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. In some cultures, dropping by unannounced is common and seen as friendly. However, boundaries are a personal thing. The author is asserting their space, which is their right. The partner's family might not be used to such clear boundaries, leading to conflict. \n\nThe author's partner is in between, feeling that her family's traditions are being challenged. The author's response was direct but not hostile\u2014stating their need for personal time and a tidy home when guests might come. The partner's family taking offense could be due to cultural differences or lack of awareness about the author's needs. \n\nIs the author at fault? Well, the author owns the home as much as their partner, so setting boundaries is reasonable. The issue might be communication style\u2014maybe the author could have expressed their feelings more gently to avoid coming off as aggressive. But the right to have personal space and privacy is valid. The family's reaction seems more about their own expectations than the author's wrongdoing. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They have a right to their personal space and expressing that is not inherently wrong, even if it causes tension. The family's expectations might be the real issue here.\n"
