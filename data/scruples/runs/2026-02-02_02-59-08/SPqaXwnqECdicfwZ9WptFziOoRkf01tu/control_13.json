I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. The situation involves the author, their partner, and her family. They came back from Iceland and had a pre-booked fancy dinner. The discussion arose about the partner's parents and friends showing up unannounced. The author expressed that they don't like that because they might have things to do or need a day to themselves. They also mentioned not wanting the house to be messy if someone shows up. Now, the partner is upset, saying it's unfair, and the author's being called aggressive.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is wrong. The key points here are about personal boundaries and communication. The author is stating their preference, which is valid. People have different comfort levels with surprise guests. The partner's family seems to have a different norm, expecting to drop by. The author is asserting their space, which is their right. However, the conflict arises because the partner is taking the side of her family and interpreting the author's honest communication as aggression.\n\nThe author mentioned they usually bite their tongue around the family but decided to express their opinion this time. It's important to consider whether expressing a valid boundary is wrong. Boundaries are healthy, and the author is not being aggressive but stating their needs. The partner's family labeling them as aggressive suggests a possible misunderstanding or resistance to change in their usual dynamic. The author isn't at fault for wanting to maintain their space and privacy. The partner's family might need to adjust their expectations since the author now has a say in shared living space. So, the author isn't wrong. Answer B.\n"
