I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about unexpected guests showing up. The author's partner and her family think it's a nice surprise, but the author doesn't like it because they might have things to do and want some alone time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The house is shared since it's \"my house as it hers,\" so both the author and the partner's family have a claim to it. The author expressed their dislike clearly but it caused a divide. The partner's family is now labeling the author as aggressively opinionated. \n\nIs it wrong for the author to have boundaries? In many cultures, having unexpected guests is common, but personal space and privacy are also important. The author didn't just say they don't like it but also explained their reasons\u2014maybe needing to do things and not wanting the house to be in a state. That seems reasonable.\n\nBut the partner is taking the side of her family, which might indicate that the family is used to this behavior. The author's stance is about setting boundaries, which is valid. However, if the house is shared, the author should have a say. But maybe the way it was communicated could have been smoother. The author mentioned they usually bite their tongue and don't share opinions, so this was a rare time they expressed it. The family might have taken it as aggression because they're not used to it.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. They have a right to their space, but perhaps the way they communicated it could have been more considerate. However, the main issue is whether the author's objection is reasonable. I think setting boundaries is okay, so the author isn't in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
