I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. The situation is that the author's partner and her family have a habit of showing up unannounced, which the author dislikes. The author expressed their feelings during a meal after a trip, and now there's tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author lives in the same house as their partner's family, so boundaries are important. The author mentioned they usually don't voice their opinions around the family, but this time they did. The partner is upset because the family thinks it's unfair, and the author is standing their ground by saying it's their house too.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, boundaries are a key part of relationships. It's reasonable for someone to want privacy and to not have unexpected guests disrupt their plans. The author had a valid reason\u2014maybe they need personal time or the house isn't ready. However, the way the author communicated this might matter. Did they do it respectfully? The story says they \"just said\" their opinion, which might not have been confrontational. \n\nThe partner and her family might feel disrespected because they're used to this behavior and see it as a positive tradition. But the author's perspective is also valid. The conflict arises from differing expectations. The author isn't wrong for setting boundaries, especially in their own home. However, maybe the timing or method of expressing this could be improved. But the question is about whether they're in the wrong, not about how to fix it.\n\nSo overall, the author isn't in the wrong for having this opinion. They have a right to their space and to communicate their needs. The family's reaction might be due to not respecting those boundaries, not because the author is wrong.\n"
