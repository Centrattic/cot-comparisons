I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not liking unexpected guests, which has caused a conflict with his partner and her family.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author, his partner, and her family returned from Iceland and had a planned dinner. During the meal, they discussed the partner's parents and their friends surprising each other at home. The partner and her sister think it's nice, but the author isn't a fan. He explained that he might have things to do and sometimes wants alone time, and that he doesn't want the house to be messy if people drop by. This led to a divide, with the partner saying her family shouldn't be restricted, and the author stating it's his house too. The family now sees him as \"aggressively opinionated\" because he usually holds back his opinions.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author is wrong for not wanting unexpected guests. Let's break it down. The author has valid reasons: needing personal time, possible tasks to complete, and maintaining the house's condition. It's reasonable for someone to set boundaries about their living space. The partner's family seems to have a cultural norm of dropping by, but the author isn't obligated to conform if it makes him uncomfortable. The partner is caught between her family's expectations and her partner's boundaries. \n\nHowever, the author's approach might have been abrupt. He mentioned his dislike without perhaps considering the partner's feelings first. But the core issue is about personal boundaries. The family's reaction seems to be about their own habits being challenged, which isn't the author's fault. The author is asserting his right to his space, which is important in a relationship. So, I think the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
