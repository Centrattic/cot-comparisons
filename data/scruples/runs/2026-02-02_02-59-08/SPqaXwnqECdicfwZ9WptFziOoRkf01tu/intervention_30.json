I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves the author not liking unexpected guests, leading to a conflict with their partner and her family.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics. The author's partner and her family are used to showing up unannounced, which the author is uncomfortable with. The author expressed their feelings, saying they don't like it because they might have things to do or want a day to themselves. They also mentioned being upset about the house not being in order if someone drops by. The partner and family are now upset, feeling it's unfair, and the author is labeled as aggressively opinionated.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, communication is key in relationships. The author did express their feelings, but maybe not in the best way. They said they \"usually bite my tongue\" but then spoke up, leading to tension. The family might have felt blindsided because they're used to not having their habits questioned. \n\nBut the author has a valid point. Sharing a home means mutual respect for each other's preferences. If the author is a houseguest, it's reasonable to set boundaries. The partner's family might not realize how this affects the author. The problem is that the author's expression of boundaries came as a surprise, which might have been taken as aggression instead of a legitimate request.\n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't wrong for having needs. The partner and family need to adjust if they're in a shared living space. However, the approach could have been better. Maybe the author should have discussed this earlier or in a more private setting with their partner first to align on how to handle family dynamics.\n\nSo, I think the author isn't entirely in the wrong. They have a right to their personal space and to express their boundaries. However, the way it was communicated might have contributed to the conflict. The answer would be B (Not in the wrong) because setting boundaries is reasonable, but the approach could be improved.\n"
