I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong (AITA). The situation involves the person not liking unexpected guests at their home, which is shared with their partner and her family.\n\nFirst, the person's main issue is that their partner's family drops by unannounced. The person expresses discomfort, explaining they might have tasks or need alone time. They also mention the house's condition if people show up unexpectedly. The partner and her family see these surprise visits as nice, but the person feels it's an invasion of their space.\n\nNow, considering boundaries in relationships. When you're in a relationship, especially with a partner's family, there can be differing expectations. The person is asserting their right to their space and time, which is a reasonable boundary. It's common for people to have different social norms; some like spontaneity, others prefer planning.\n\nThe partner is defending her family's behavior, which might indicate that she hasn't fully considered the person's perspective. The fact that the person usually holds back their opinions but now expressed their discomfort suggests they felt the need to set a boundary. Being labeled as \"aggressively opinionated\" by the partner's parents could stem from the family not being used to hearing such feedback, not necessarily from the person being wrong.\n\nOwnership of the home is a key point. The person states it's their house as much as the partner's. This implies joint ownership, so the other party's family shouldn't assume they can come over without notice. The person's right to privacy and personal space should be respected.\n\nThe conflict arises from differing values: spontaneity vs. planning. The person isn't wrong for valuing their personal time and space. The partner and family might need to adjust their expectations. The person's way of communicating their discomfort was straightforward but valid. They didn't attack the family, just stated their reasons.\n\nTherefore, the person isn't in the wrong. They're defending their personal boundaries, which is essential in any relationship. The partner and her family need to respect these boundaries instead of seeing the person's stance as unfair. Hence, the answer is B.\n"
