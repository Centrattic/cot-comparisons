I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. So the situation is that they and their partner, along with her family, came back from a trip and were talking about their family's habit of surprising each other at their houses. The partner and her sister think it's nice, but the author doesn't. They mentioned that they might have things to do and need personal days. The partner is upset because she thinks her family should be able to show up whenever, and the author is now seen as aggressive.\n\nHmm. The key points here are boundaries and communication. The author is asserting their own need for personal space and time, which is a valid concern. Everyone has different comfort levels with guests. The partner's family might be more open to spontaneity, but the author isn't. The problem seems to be that the author didn't express this before, so now there's a conflict. \n\nBut wait, the author says they usually bite their tongue around the partner's family. So maybe they haven't communicated their preferences effectively. However, now that they've expressed their feelings, the partner and her family are upset. The question is whether the author is wrong for having this boundary. \n\nI think the author is not wrong. It's reasonable to want control over one's own home and time. The partner's family might not realize that unexpected visits can be a burden. The divide is more about differing expectations and lack of communication prior. The author isn't being aggressive; they're setting a boundary. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
