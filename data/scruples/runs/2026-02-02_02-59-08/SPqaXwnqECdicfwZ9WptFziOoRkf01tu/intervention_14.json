I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about unexpected guests and differing opinions on that.\n\nFirst, the author is part of a couple with their partner, and they've just come back from a trip. They had a pre-booked fancy dinner to wrap things up. During the meal, the conversation turned to the partner's parents and their friends dropping by unannounced. The author didn't like the idea, while the partner and her sister found it nice. The author explained that they might have things to do and prefer having a day to themselves, and also mentioned not wanting the house to be messy if guests show up unexpectedly. \n\nNow, the conflict arose because the partner thinks it's unfair that her family can't just drop by, and the author's family labels them as aggressively opinionated. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nHmm. The key points here are boundaries and communication. The author is expressing their discomfort with unexpected visits, which is a valid feeling. People have different social preferences. The partner's side sees these surprise visits as a nice gesture, but the author feels it's an invasion of their personal space and time. \n\nThe author's argument is that the house is shared, so their preferences should be considered. The partner's family might not realize that this is a new dynamic now that the author is part of the household. The author tried to communicate their stance but was met with resistance. \n\nIs it wrong to have personal boundaries? Probably not. Everyone has the right to their own space and time. However, the way the author expressed their opinion might have come off as dismissive or aggressive, especially since they mention they usually bite their tongue. Maybe the tone or the way it was presented could have been smoother. \n\nBut the main issue is the differing expectations. The partner's family has a tradition of showing up unannounced, which might be common in their culture or family norms. The author's preference for having control over their schedule and space is also valid. The conflict stems from clashing norms. \n\nSo, I think the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have a right to set boundaries in their home. However, the way the partner's family reacted might be due to not understanding the author's perspective. The key here is mutual respect and finding a middle ground. The author isn't wrong for wanting to maintain their personal space, especially if it's part of the shared home they occupy. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
