I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. The situation involves the author's partner's family who are used to showing up unannounced. The author expressed their discomfort, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's partner and her family see the surprise visits as a nice gesture, while the author feels it's intrusive. The key points here are boundaries, communication, and mutual respect. \n\nThe author is living in a shared space, which might be their home. If the home is equally theirs, then the author has a right to set boundaries. However, the way the author communicated their feelings might have been a factor. They mentioned biting their tongue usually, so this time they expressed their opinion, which led to being labeled as aggressive. \n\nIt's important to assess if the author's response was reasonable. Expressing a preference for some personal time and concern about the house's state isn't unreasonable. However, the partner and family might feel that this is an overreaction or a lack of consideration for their traditions. \n\nThe author's position isn't inherently wrong. Everyone has the right to personal space and to communicate their needs. However, the conflict arises from differing expectations. The problem isn't about right or wrong but about differing values and the need for compromise. \n\nIf the author didn't overstep by being aggressive or dismissive, then they aren't in the wrong. The partner's family might need to adjust their behavior if the home is shared. So, the answer likely leans towards the author not being in the wrong.\n"
