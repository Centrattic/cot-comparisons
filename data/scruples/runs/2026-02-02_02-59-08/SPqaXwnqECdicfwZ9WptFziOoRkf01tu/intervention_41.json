I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author, their partner, and her family just came back from Iceland and had a pre-booked restaurant meal. During the meal, the topic of the partner's parents and friends showing up unannounced came up. The author expressed that they don't like unexpected guests because they might have things to do or need a day to themselves. The partner and her sister think it's a nice surprise, but the author's opinion caused a divide. Now, the partner is saying it's unfair, and the author's family labeled them as aggressive.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about personal boundaries and communication. The author is stating their preferences about not liking unexpected guests. They mentioned that they usually don't share their opinions around the partner's family. Now they're being called aggressive for speaking up. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Well, the author has a right to set boundaries in their own home. If the house is shared, the author's feelings about unannounced visits should be considered. It's about mutual respect. The partner's family might have different norms, but that doesn't mean the author is wrong to express their discomfort. However, the way it was communicated might have been an issue. The author said they usually bite their tongue, so maybe this was the first time they spoke up, leading to the conflict. \n\nBut the main issue is that the author is defending their space, which is valid. The partner's family expecting to drop by without notice might be overstepping. The author isn't wrong for having this stance. The problem might be more on the partner's family not respecting the author's preferences. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
