I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (AITA poster) is in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. The situation is that they and their partner's family just got back from Iceland, had a nice dinner, and talked about the partner's parents' friends showing up unannounced. The author expressed their dislike for this, saying they might have things to do and need alone time, and mentioned not wanting the house to be messy. This caused a divide, with the partner saying it's unfair and the parents calling the author aggressively opinionated.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is in a relationship and lives with their partner's family? Or is it the partner's parents showing up unannounced at the author's home? The key point is that the author is expressing their boundaries, which is a natural thing to do. However, the partner's family sees it as being against their social norms. \n\nThe partner is defending her family's behavior, saying it's unfair. The author is asserting their own space, which is important for personal well-being. People have different comfort levels regarding privacy and unannounced visits. The author isn't being hostile but is stating their preferences. The partner's family might be used to a more open and welcoming approach, so the conflict arises from differing expectations.\n\nIs expressing a preference for not having unexpected guests wrong? Probably not. People have the right to set boundaries in their own home. The author's home is shared with their partner, so they have a right to privacy there. The issue might be that the partner is not respecting the author's perspective, or perhaps the family isn't considering the author's needs.\n\nThe author was labeled as \"aggressively opinionated,\" which suggests that the family might be sensitive to any criticism of their habits. But if the author is in a committed relationship, their partner's family should also respect their boundaries. It's a matter of mutual respect. If the partner is taking sides with her family without acknowledging the author's feelings, that's a problem in the relationship.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for expressing their feelings. They have a right to privacy and their own preferences. The partner's family and the partner might be the ones not respecting those boundaries. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
