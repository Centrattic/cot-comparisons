I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about unexpected guests at their home. The author's partner and her family think it's okay to drop by without notice, but the author doesn't like that and expressed their discomfort. Now the partner is upset, and the author is being called \"aggressively opinionated.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is in a relationship and shares a home with their partner. The partner's family has a tradition of visiting without prior notice, which the author finds inconvenient. The author made their feelings known, which led to tension. The key points are about boundaries, communication, and mutual respect.\n\nThe author's argument is about having a say in their own home. Since it's a shared house, both partners should have input. The author isn't being unreasonable by wanting to set boundaries. However, the way the author expressed their opinion might have come off as harsh, especially if they usually don't voice their opinions. The partner's family's reaction suggests that the author's communication style might have been a factor. \n\nBut the core issue is about the right to have personal space and control over their home. The author isn't wrong for wanting to establish that. The partner's family's expectation of unannounced visits might not align with the author's preferences. The author's statement about the house being \"as much theirs as it is hers\" is valid. \n\nHowever, the author's approach could be improved. Instead of making a blanket statement about not liking surprises, maybe setting specific boundaries in a more constructive way would be better. But that doesn't mean the author is in the wrong for having those feelings. \n\nThe partner and family need to respect the author's boundaries, just as the author should respect the family's habits. The problem seems to be a miscommunication or lack of prior discussion about expectations. The author isn't at fault for expressing their needs now, even if it's causing conflict. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
