I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not liking unexpected guests, which caused a conflict with the partner's family.\n\nFirst, the context: The author, their partner, and her family had just returned from a trip. They had a pre-booked fancy meal to wrap up the holiday. During the meal, the conversation turned to the partner's parents and friends showing up unannounced. The partner and her sister liked the idea, but the author expressed discomfort, mentioning needing personal time and not wanting the house to be messy. This led to a divide, with the partner feeling it's unfair, and the author's opinion led to being labeled as aggressive.\n\nThe user initially thought the author might be in the wrong but is unsure. The prompt asks if the author is in the wrong, with options A (Yes) or B (No).\n\nKey points to consider:\n1. **Respect for boundaries**: The author is setting a boundary regarding their personal space and time. It's common for people to need alone time or to not want unexpected visitors. The author's concern about the house being in a state suggests they value privacy and preparedness.\n2. **Communication style**: The author mentioned usually biting their tongue, which implies they might not usually voice their opinions around the partner's family. In this case, they spoke up, which the family might perceive as sudden or aggressive, especially if it's out of character. However, the author is stating their legitimate feelings, which is valid.\n3. **Ownership of the house**: The author emphasizes it's \"as much their house as the partner's,\" indicating they have a right to set rules about who enters without notice. Co-habitation often involves compromise, but each person should have a say in household rules.\n4. **Partner's perspective**: The partner feels the family can't just show up whenever, but the author's stance is about mutual respect. The partner might not have considered the author's need for personal space before, leading to the conflict.\n5. **Family reactions**: The family labels the author as \"aggressively opinionated,\" which might be a defensive reaction to having their habits criticized. However, the author's expression of their preferences isn't inherently aggressive unless delivered hostilely.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, setting boundaries is not inherently wrong. The author is advocating for their needs in a shared living space. The issue might be in how the boundary was communicated, but the content of the message is reasonable. The partner's family may not have considered the author's perspective, but that doesn't make the author wrong for expressing their feelings.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The conflict arises from differing expectations and potential communication gaps, but the author's right to their preferences is valid.\n"
