I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong.\n\nSo the situation is that the author's partner and her family have a tradition of showing up unannounced at each other's houses as a surprise. The author didn't like this and expressed their discomfort, saying they might have things to do or need a day to themselves. The partner is upset because the author is now making it \"not fair\" for her family to drop by. The partner's parents even labeled the author as \"aggressively opinionated\" for speaking up.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about boundaries and how they're communicated. The author is stating that their home is also theirs, not just the partner's. That's a valid point because when you're in a relationship with someone who has family, you should have a say in how your shared space is used. The author didn't say they hate the idea completely, just that they don't like it when it's unexpected because they might have other plans or need personal time.\n\nThe partner's family seems to view this as a cultural norm or a nice surprise, but the author's right to set boundaries is important. The author did express their feelings calmly, even giving examples like needing to get things done or not wanting the house to be in disarray. That's reasonable. The partner's family reacting negatively to the author's opinion is more about their own expectations clashing with the author's needs.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They're standing up for their personal space and preferences, which is their right. The partner's family might be inconsiderate for not respecting those boundaries, but the author isn't the one at fault here. The issue is more about the partner and her family not being open to the author's perspective. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
