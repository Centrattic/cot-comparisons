I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is at fault here. The situation is about unexpected guests causing a conflict between the author and his partner's family.\n\nSo, the author, his partner, and her family came back from Iceland and had a fancy dinner. During the meal, they discussed how the partner's parents and friends pop in unannounced. The partner and her sister think it's nice, but the author disagrees. He mentioned he doesn't like it because he might have things to do or need alone time, and also worried about the house being messy. The partner is upset, saying it's unfair, and the author says the house is shared. The family now thinks he's being aggressive for finally speaking up.\n\nHmm. The key points here are boundaries and communication. The author is setting boundaries about his personal space and time, which is a valid concern. Many people might find unannounced visits stressful. The partner's family seems to have different expectations, and the author finally expressed his feelings, leading to conflict. \n\nIs he wrong for not liking unexpected guests? Probably not. Everyone has different preferences. The partner might feel her family's traditions are being challenged, but the author has a right to his own space. The problem might be more about how the communication was handled, but the author's stance isn't inherently wrong. The family's reaction to his honesty might be the issue here. So the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
