I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not liking unexpected guests, which has caused a conflict with their partner and her family.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author, their partner, and her family just returned from Iceland and had a pre-booked restaurant meal. During the meal, they discussed the partner's parents and their friends showing up unannounced. The partner and her sister like these surprises, but the author doesn't. The author expressed their discomfort, mentioning they might have things to do and want some alone time. The partner feels it's unfair that her family can't just drop by, and the author's statement that the house is as much theirs as the partner's has led to tension. The partner's parents now see the author as aggressively opinionated because they usually don't voice their opinions around them.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but is seeking a second opinion. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nTo determine this, I need to consider the expectations in relationships and shared living spaces. The author is sharing a home with their partner's family, which can create different expectations about privacy and personal space. The author's concern about unexpected guests is about having control over their schedule and living environment. On the other hand, the partner and her family might see these surprise visits as a way to maintain close family ties.\n\nIn many relationships, especially when merging households, differing expectations about guests can lead to conflict. The author's issue is not about refusing guests entirely but about unannounced visits disrupting their plans and space. It's reasonable for someone to want advance notice, especially if they have plans or need personal time. The author did express their feelings calmly, not aggressively. The partner's parents might be upset because they're used to a different dynamic, but the author is now part of the household and has a right to set boundaries.\n\nThe key here is whether asserting one's personal boundaries is unreasonable. In general, people should be able to express their needs without being labeled as aggressive, especially if they're sharing a home. The author isn't being inconsiderate; they're stating their preferences. The partner's family's reaction might be more about not wanting to change their habits rather than the author being wrong.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. They have a valid need for privacy and control over their schedule, which is reasonable in a shared living situation. The partner and her family may need to adjust their expectations, but the author expressing their feelings isn't the issue here.\n"
