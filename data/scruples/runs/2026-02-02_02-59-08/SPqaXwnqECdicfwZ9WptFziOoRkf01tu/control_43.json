I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who posted this is in the wrong. The situation is about unexpected guests. So the author's partner and her family think it's okay to show up unannounced, but the author doesn't like that. The author explained their feelings, but now there's a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective: they don't like surprises, need personal space, and are concerned about the house being in order. That makes sense. People have different boundaries, and it's reasonable to want some control over their home environment.\n\nOn the other hand, the partner and her family see unannounced visits as a nice surprise. Family dynamics can vary, and some cultures or families might value spontaneous visits. The partner might feel that the author is being too strict or not accommodating enough.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points are communication and mutual respect. The author did express their feelings calmly, saying they prefer not to have unexpected guests. They also mentioned the house is shared, so their input should be considered. The other side is labeling the author as \"aggressively opinionated,\" which might be a misunderstanding or defensiveness from the partner's family.\n\nIn relationships, differences in preferences are common. What's important is how those preferences are communicated and respected. The author isn't being aggressive; they're setting boundaries. The partner's family's reaction might stem from not understanding the author's perspective. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to maintain their personal space and the state of the home. It's a matter of differing values, not necessarily a right or wrong. So the answer should be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
