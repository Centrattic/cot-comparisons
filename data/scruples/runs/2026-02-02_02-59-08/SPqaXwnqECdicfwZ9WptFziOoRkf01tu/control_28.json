I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person in the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me read through the details again.\n\nSo, the author is in a relationship with a partner whose family tends to drop by unexpectedly. After coming back from a trip, they had a discussion about this. The author expressed that they don't like surprise guests because they might need to do things or have alone time, and they don't want the house to be messy. Now there's a conflict because the partner and family are upset, saying it's unfair and that the author is being too opinionated.\n\nHmm. The main points here are about boundaries in a shared living space. The author is stating their preferences, which is reasonable. When people live together, especially in a relationship, it's important to have mutual respect for each other's space and time. The author isn't against all guests, but against unexpected ones. They gave specific reasons: needing personal time and avoiding the house being in disarray when unannounced visitors come. \n\nThe partner's family is used to visiting without notice, which is a common practice in some cultures or families. However, the author is now part of this living arrangement, so their boundaries should be considered. The partner is defending her family's habits, but maybe hasn't considered the author's perspective. \n\nThe author didn't lash out or be aggressive; they stated their feelings calmly. They usually hold back their opinions around the partner's family, which makes their stance even more understandable. Being called \"aggressively opinionated\" might be a misunderstanding from the family, not the author's fault. \n\nSo, the author is in the right because they are asserting their needs in a shared space. The partner's family should be accommodating, given that the author is part of the household now. The key here is mutual respect for boundaries. The answer should be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong)."
