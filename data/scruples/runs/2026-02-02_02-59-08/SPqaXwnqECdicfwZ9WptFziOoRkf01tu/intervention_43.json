I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not liking unexpected guests, which caused a conflict with their partner's family.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author, their partner, and her family came back from Iceland and had a fancy dinner. During the meal, they discussed the partner's parents and their friends showing up unannounced. The partner and her sister think it's a nice surprise, but the author disagrees. The author explained they don't like it because they might have things to do or need a day to themselves and also mentioned the house might not be clean. This caused a divide, with the partner saying it's unfair, and the author's partner's family labeling them as aggressive for expressing their opinion.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are boundaries, communication, and mutual respect. The author is expressing their discomfort with unexpected guests. They did communicate their feelings, albeit briefly. The partner's family might be used to a certain way of socializing, but the author has the right to set boundaries in their own home. However, the way the author expressed their opinion might have come off as harsh, especially if they usually don't voice their opinions around the family. The partner's reaction suggests that the author's statement disrupted an existing norm they were comfortable with.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong for having different preferences? Probably not. Everyone has different comfort levels regarding personal space and privacy. The issue here is more about the partner's family not respecting the author's boundaries and the partner taking their side. The author isn't wrong for wanting control over their own home. However, the way they communicated their stance might need refinement to avoid conflict. But the main question is about being in the wrong, not about communication style.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They have the right to set boundaries in their shared home and express their preferences, even if it causes some friction. The partner's family and partner need to respect those boundaries.\n"
