I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. They're in a relationship with their partner and her family. The conflict started after a trip where they had a nice dinner, and during the conversation, the topic of parents and friends showing up unannounced came up. The author expressed their dislike, stating they prefer having time to themselves and not wanting the house in a mess. The partner's side thinks it's a nice surprise, and now there's a divide. The author's partner is saying it's unfair, and the family is labeling the author as aggressive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider boundaries in relationships. When you're in a relationship, especially with a partner who has family, there's an expectation that you might have to navigate each other's social norms. But personal boundaries are important too. The author is expressing their discomfort with surprise visits, which is a valid concern. People have different needs for personal space and privacy. \n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The author did communicate their feelings, which is good. They mentioned they usually hold back their opinions around the partner's family, which suggests they might be avoiding conflict, but in this case, they did speak up. The partner's family's reaction seems to be about feeling judged, which is not uncommon when personal habits are questioned. \n\nHowever, the partner's family visiting each other as surprises might be a common practice for them. The author's objection might be seen as disrupting that tradition. The partner is caught between her family and her partner, which can create tension. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, expressing a preference about one's own home isn't wrong. The house is shared, so both the author and their partner have a say in how it's used. The author's concern about needing personal time and not wanting to be caught off guard is reasonable. The family's reaction of calling the author aggressive might stem from feeling that their social customs are being criticized. \n\nBut the author isn't wrong for having these boundaries. Everyone has the right to feel comfortable in their home. The issue might be more about how the communication was handled. The author could have approached it in a way that validates the partner's family's intentions while setting their own boundaries, but the fact that they communicated their feelings isn't inherently wrong. \n\nThe partner's side might feel that the author is being too rigid, but that's a misunderstanding of the author's needs. The author's stance is about personal space and preparedness, which are legitimate. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
