I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. The situation involves the author's partner and her family who are used to showing up unannounced. The author expressed their discomfort, which led to conflict.\n\nFirst, the author is sharing their personal feelings. They mentioned that they value having days to themselves and not wanting the house to be in a mess if someone drops by. That seems like a valid concern. Privacy and personal space are important aspects of any living arrangement. \n\nThe partner and her family see surprise visits as a nice gesture, but the author isn't on board. The main issue here is differing expectations about social norms in a shared living space. The author didn't just bite their tongue all the time, which might have been their usual approach, but this time they spoke up. That's understandable because if it's their home too, they have the right to set boundaries.\n\nThe partner's family is reacting negatively, labeling the author as aggressive. But the author's statement was about their preferences and needs, not an attack. It's reasonable to communicate boundaries without being considered in the wrong. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. They're asserting their right to privacy and personal space in their own home. The partner and her family might need to adjust their expectations, but that's a matter of mutual respect rather than one party being at fault. The answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
