I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not liking unexpected guests at their home, which is shared with their partner and her family.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the scenario. The author, their partner, and partner's family returned from Iceland and had a meal. During the meal, they discussed the partner's parents and friends showing up unannounced. The partner and her sister think it's a nice surprise, but the author disagrees. The author explained they don't like it because they might have things to do or need a day to themselves and don't want the house messy if someone shows up. Now, the partner is upset, saying it's unfair, and the author's partner's family labels them as \"aggressively opinionated\" because they usually hold their tongue.\n\nSo the key points are: the author is expressing their discomfort with unsolicited visits, which is causing tension in the relationship and with the partner's family. The partner feels the family's tradition or habit is being criticized, while the author is asserting their right to personal space in their home.\n\nI need to decide if the author is in the wrong. The question is about whether expressing a dislike for unexpected guests is wrong. Legally, in most places, guests can't be forced to allow entry, so the author has the right to control their home. Socially, it's a matter of differing expectations. The author is communicating their boundaries, which is healthy. The partner's family might see it as a cultural or social norm to visit without notice, but the author is setting limits. The problem here is the conflict arising from differing values. The author isn't being aggressive; they're stating their needs. The partner's family's reaction seems to be more about their own expectations being challenged. The partner is caught between her family's norms and her partner's needs. \n\nThe author isn't wrong to express their feelings about their personal space. It's reasonable to want to manage one's schedule and home environment. The issue is more about differing perspectives, but the author isn't at fault for asserting their boundaries. The partner's family's reaction is a response to the author's honest communication, which isn't inherently wrong. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
