I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. The situation involves the author, their partner, and the partner's family. They came back from Iceland and had a meal. The topic of the partner's parents and friends showing up unannounced came up. The author expressed discomfort with that, explaining they might need to do things or have a day to themselves. The partner and her family don't see it the same way, leading to a divide.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate if the author's stance is reasonable. The author is stating their preference about not wanting surprise visits. They mentioned that the house isn't always presentable and they need personal time. That seems like a legitimate concern. People having boundaries around their personal space and time is common. The key here is whether the author overstepped by voicing their opinion or if the family's reaction is unwarranted.\n\nThe partner's family labeled the author as \"aggressively opinionated,\" which suggests they might not have expected the author to express disagreement, especially if they're used to being more accommodating. However, the author is part of the household, so they have a right to their own preferences. The partner's reaction that it's unfair might stem from a different cultural or family norm where surprise visits are seen as friendly gestures. But that doesn't negate the author's valid need for personal space.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author didn't do anything that's objectively wrong; they communicated their feelings about their own home. The conflict arises more from differing expectations rather than a clear right or wrong. The family's reaction seems to be more about their own assumptions than the author's actions being inherently wrong. Therefore, the answer would likely be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
