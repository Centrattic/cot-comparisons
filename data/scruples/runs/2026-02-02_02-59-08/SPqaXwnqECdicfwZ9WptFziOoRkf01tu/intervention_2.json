I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. The situation involves the author's partner and her family, who are used to showing up unannounced. The author expressed discomfort with this, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author's partner and her family see surprise visits as a nice gesture, but the author doesn't. The author mentioned that they might have things to do and prefer some alone time. They also said they don't want the house to be messy if someone shows up. The partner is upset, saying it's unfair, and the author's family now thinks they're being aggressive.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. From a general perspective, personal boundaries are important. It's reasonable to want privacy and to communicate that. The author's house is shared, so they have a right to set rules about guests. However, the way the author communicated their feelings might have been a factor. They said they usually bite their tongue but then expressed their opinion, which might have come across as abrupt.\n\nBut the main issue here is about differing expectations. The partner's family is used to a certain dynamic, but the author has different preferences. The author isn't being unreasonable by wanting to set boundaries. The problem is the conflict arising from unmet expectations. The partner's family might feel disrespected, but the author isn't in the wrong for having those boundaries. The key is mutual respect and communication. Since the author is standing up for their own needs and communicating that the house is shared, they're not wrong. The family should adjust their behavior considering the new household dynamics.\n"
