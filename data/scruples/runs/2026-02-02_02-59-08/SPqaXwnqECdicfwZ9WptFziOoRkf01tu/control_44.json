I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. The situation involves the author, their partner, and her family.\n\nThe key points here are about boundaries and shared living spaces. The author shares that they're not comfortable with surprise visits because they might have things to do or need alone time. They also mention that they usually hold back their opinions but spoke up here, leading to conflict. The partner's family is upset, calling the author \"aggressively opinionated.\"\n\nI need to consider cultural norms, relationship dynamics, and mutual respect. In many cultures, unannounced visits are common, but others value privacy. Since the author and their partner live together, the house is a shared space, and both have a right to set boundaries. The author expressed their discomfort respectfully, not in an aggressive way. The partner's family's reaction seems to stem from a different expectation, not necessarily the author's fault. The author isn't wrong for wanting to set boundaries; it's about mutual respect and communication. So the answer is B.\n"
