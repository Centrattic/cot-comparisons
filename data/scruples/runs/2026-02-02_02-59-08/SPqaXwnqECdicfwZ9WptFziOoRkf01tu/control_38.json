I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not liking unexpected guests, which caused a conflict with their partner and her family.\n\nFirst, the author and their partner had just come back from a trip and had a pre-booked fancy dinner. They discussed how the partner's family and parents visit each other without notice. The author expressed discomfort with this, explaining they need personal time and don't want to be interrupted. They also mentioned the house might not be in order if guests drop by.\n\nThe partner thinks it's unfair that their family can't just show up, while the author feels it's their house too. The family called the author aggressive for finally sharing their opinion.\n\nNow, considering boundaries and mutual respect. The author has a right to set boundaries in their home. It's common for people to prefer knowing when guests are coming, especially after a trip. The author didn't say they hate the family, just that they need some space. The partner's family might not realize the impact of unannounced visits. The author's reaction seems reasonable because everyone needs personal space. The label of \"aggressively opinionated\" might be a misunderstanding from the family. So, the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries.\n"
