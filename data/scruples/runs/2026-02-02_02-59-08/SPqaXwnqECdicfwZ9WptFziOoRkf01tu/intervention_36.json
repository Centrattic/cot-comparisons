I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. The situation is that the author's partner and her family have a tradition of surprising each other, but the author doesn't like it. They had a disagreement after a meal, and the partner's family is now upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is expressing their preference to have some privacy and not be caught off guard. That's a common boundary. On the other hand, the partner's family might see these surprises as a way to bond and show affection. The partner is caught between her family's customs and her partner's comfort.\n\nThe key points here are about boundaries and communication. The author did express their discomfort, which is important. The partner's family might not realize how intrusive these visits are. However, the author's response might have been perceived as dismissive or aggressive, especially if they only speak up when it's an issue. The phrase \"bite my tongue around her family and don't share my opinion\" suggests that the author hasn't communicated their feelings before, leading to a sudden conflict. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to discuss boundaries early on. The author's stance is valid\u2014they have the right to privacy in their home. But maybe the way they expressed it could have been more empathetic. The partner's family might feel disrespected if their traditions are suddenly criticized. The divide is because both sides are trying to protect their comfort zones. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They're not wrong for having a boundary. However, if they didn't communicate their preferences earlier, that could contribute to the conflict. The problem might be more about the timing of the conversation rather than the content. The family's reaction might be due to feeling blindsided by criticism after years of their way. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for expressing their needs, but they could have handled the conversation more sensitively. The issue is mutual misunderstanding rather than one person being wrong. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
