I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is at fault. The situation involves the author not liking unexpected guests, which caused a conflict with their partner's family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider boundaries in relationships. The author shares a home with their partner, so having input on who comes over and when is reasonable. The partner's family expects surprise visits, but the author prefers privacy and time to themselves. That's a legitimate need. \n\nThe partner is defending her family's actions, saying it's unfair, but the author is asserting their own space. The key point is mutual respect. The author didn't say they can't have guests ever, just that they don't like surprises. The family taking offense might be because they're used to different boundaries. \n\nThe author's response was straightforward, explaining their reasons. They didn't necessarily act aggressively, just stated their preferences. The partner's family labeling them as \"aggressively opinionated\" might be a misunderstanding. The author has every right to set boundaries in their shared home. \n\nNo laws are broken here, just differing expectations. The author isn't in the wrong because they're asserting their needs. The partner and her family need to adjust their expectations. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
