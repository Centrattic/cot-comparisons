I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about unexpected guests and differing opinions between the author, their partner, and her family.\n\nFirst, the author explains that after a trip, they and their partner's family had a reservation at a fancy restaurant. During this meal, they discussed how the partner's parents and their friends often drop by unannounced. The partner and her sister like these surprises, but the author isn't a fan. The author expressed their discomfort, mentioning needing personal time and the house being in order. This led to conflict, with the partner's family labeling the author as too aggressive for finally sharing their opinion.\n\nNow, the user initially thought the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion. The question is whether the author is at fault here. \n\nLooking at the details: The author has a right to their own preferences, especially in their shared home. It's reasonable to set boundaries about unexpected guests. The issue seems to be communication. The author mentioned they usually hold back their opinions, which might have led to the partner's family not respecting their boundaries. By finally expressing their feelings, the author is trying to set limits, which is valid. However, the way it was communicated could be part of the problem if it came out as confrontational. \n\nThe partner's family might have felt disrespected because they're used to a different social norm. The partner is caught between her family's habits and her partner's boundaries. The author's point about the house being \"as much theirs as hers\" is important because it's their shared space. \n\nI think the core issue is about differing expectations and the timing of communication. The author isn't wrong for having these feelings, but maybe the approach could have been more considerate. However, the key point is that the author is asserting their right to personal space in a shared home, which is legitimate. The family's reaction might stem from not realizing the author's preferences before. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong; they're setting boundaries after being too quiet before. Therefore, the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
