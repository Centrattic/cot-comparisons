I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nSo, the author, their partner, and the partner's family came back from Iceland and had a planned meal. During the meal, they talked about the partner's parents and their friends showing up unannounced. The partner and her sister think it's a nice surprise, but the author doesn't like it. The author explained that they might have things to do and sometimes want a day to themselves, and also mentioned the house being in order if someone shows up. Now, the partner is upset, saying it's not fair that her family can't just drop by. The author says they usually hold back their opinions around the family, but now they're labeled as aggressive.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about boundaries and communication. The author is expressing their discomfort with unannounced visits. They have a valid reason\u2014wanting personal time and not wanting the house in disarray. However, the partner's family is used to this practice, and the author's direct communication led to conflict. \n\nIs the author wrong for setting a boundary? Probably not. Everyone has the right to their preferences and to set limits on their living space. However, the way the author communicated it might have come off as harsh. They said they usually bite their tongue, implying they didn't communicate their feelings before. Now, after expressing it, they're seen as aggressive. That's a problem. \n\nBut the main issue is whether the author is in the wrong for having this preference. I don't think so. It's reasonable to want privacy and to manage one's time. The conflict arises from differing expectations. The author isn't wrong for not liking surprises; they're wrong if they didn't communicate this earlier or if their response was unnecessarily harsh. However, the scenario doesn't indicate that the author was rude. They explained their reasons calmly. So the author is not in the wrong. The partner's family might need to adjust their expectations, but the author's stance is valid. Therefore, answer B.\n"
