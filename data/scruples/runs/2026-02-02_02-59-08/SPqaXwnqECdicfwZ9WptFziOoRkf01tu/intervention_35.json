I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about unexpected guests. The author's partner and her family think showing up unannounced is nice, but the author doesn't like it. The author expressed their discomfort, and now there's tension.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author lives in a house that's shared with their partner's family. The partner's family is used to dropping by without notice. The author, however, values personal time and space, so they mentioned not being comfortable with that. The partner is defending her family, and the author is standing their ground, saying it's their house too.\n\nThe main question is whether expressing a preference for privacy is wrong. In relationships, communication is key. The author did express their feelings, which is good. The partner's family might not be used to that, hence the conflict. The author is asserting their space, which is a valid need. People have different boundaries, and it's important to respect each other's. The author isn't saying they can't have guests ever, just that they need to be aware of the author's needs. So the author isn't in the wrong. They're setting boundaries, which is healthy. The answer should be B.\n"
