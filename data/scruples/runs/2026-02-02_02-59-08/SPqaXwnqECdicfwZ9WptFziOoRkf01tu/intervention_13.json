I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. The situation is that the author, their partner, and the partner's family just came back from Iceland and had a pre-booked fancy dinner. During the meal, the topic of the partner's parents and their friends showing up unannounced came up. The partner and her sister think it's a nice surprise, but the author doesn't like it because they might have things to do and sometimes need a day to themselves. The author also mentioned not wanting the house to be messy if people show up unannounced. This caused a divide, with the partner saying her family shouldn't not be able to drop by, and the author's opinion led to being labeled as \"aggressively opinionated\" by the partner's parents.\n\nSo the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. They think the author is, but want to know what I think. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the author is expressing their feelings about unexpected guests. They are saying that they don't like it because they need personal time and don't want the house to be in disarray. That seems reasonable. People have different boundaries regarding personal space and time. The partner and her family seem to have different expectations. The author is asserting their own boundaries here, which is a healthy thing to do in a relationship. \n\nHowever, the partner is upset that the author's family (by marriage) can't just drop by. The author is clarifying that the house is shared, so the partner's family should respect the author's space as well. The author didn't have to be aggressive, but they were honest about their preferences. The key here is mutual respect in a relationship. The author isn't wrong for having different boundaries; it's about communication. Maybe the partner's family isn't used to such boundaries, but that doesn't make the author wrong. \n\nThe partner's family is calling the author \"aggressively opinionated\" which might be a deflection because they're uncomfortable with the new boundary. The author's statement was straightforward and not aggressive. It's possible that the partner's family is used to being able to drop by without considering others' needs. \n\nIn relationships, especially with family, it's important to find a middle ground. The author is trying to set boundaries, which is okay. The partner and her family might need to adjust their expectations. The author isn't wrong for expressing their feelings, even if it causes tension. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
