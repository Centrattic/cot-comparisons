I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person described in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author expressing discomfort with unexpected guests from the partner's family. The author's partner and her family see surprise visits as a nice gesture, but the author prefers some privacy and doesn't like having to be prepared for unannounced visits.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author is in a relationship where the partner's family has a habit of showing up uninvited. The author communicated their feelings about this, which led to tension. The partner and her family are upset, thinking the author is being overly opinionated, while the author feels their space is being invaded.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate that. From a general perspective, it's important to respect each other's boundaries in a relationship. The author is asserting their own boundaries, which is a reasonable thing to do. However, the way the communication happened might matter. The author mentions they usually \"bite their tongue\" around the partner's family, so this might be the first time they expressed their true feelings, leading to the conflict. \n\nThe partner's family's expectation of surprise visits might be part of their cultural or family norms. However, the author now lives in a shared house, so both the author and the partner's family need to adjust their expectations. The author has a right to feel that the house should be a space where they can have privacy and not be caught off guard. On the other hand, the partner and her family might feel that their social norms are being ignored.\n\nThe key issue here is about mutual respect for boundaries. The author isn't wrong for wanting their space. The problem might stem from the abrupt change in communication style. If the author usually keeps their opinions to themselves and then suddenly express them, it can come as a shock to the partner's family, leading to the label of being \"aggressively opinionated.\" However, that doesn't mean the author is in the wrong. It's more about the partner's family needing to adjust their expectations when entering a shared living situation.\n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong for setting boundaries. The issue is more about the partner and her family's resistance to those boundaries and the communication style used. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
