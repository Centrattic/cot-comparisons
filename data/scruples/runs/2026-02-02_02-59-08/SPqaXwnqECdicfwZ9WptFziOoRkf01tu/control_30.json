I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. The situation involves the author, their partner, and the partner's family. They just came back from Iceland and had a planned fancy dinner. During the meal, the topic of the partner's parents and their friends showing up unannounced came up. The partner and her sister think it's a nice surprise, but the author doesn't like it. The author explained they might have things to do or need a day to themselves and worried about the house being messy. Now there's a divide because the partner feels it's unfair, and the author's opinion is seen as aggressive by the in-laws.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author's stance is reasonable. The author is expressing a preference for not having unexpected guests. They have a valid reason: needing personal time and wanting the house to be presentable. It's common for people to have different boundaries regarding guests. The author is living in the house as well, so it's reasonable for them to want control over their own space. The partner's family might have different social norms where unannounced visits are seen as friendly, but that doesn't mean the author is wrong. The key here is mutual respect for each other's boundaries. The author isn't being aggressive just because they expressed their opinion; they're setting a boundary. The partner's family's reaction seems to be about not respecting the author's perspective. The author is not in the wrong for wanting to set these boundaries. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
