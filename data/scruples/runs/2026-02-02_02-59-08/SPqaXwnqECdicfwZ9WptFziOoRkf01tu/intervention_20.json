I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. The situation is that the author, their partner, and the partner's family just returned from Iceland, and they had a fancy dinner planned. During the meal, the topic came up about the partner's parents and their friends showing up unannounced. The partner and sister like the surprise, but the author doesn't. The author explained they prefer having time to themselves and not wanting to be interrupted. Now, the partner is saying her family can't just show up whenever, and the author is accused of being aggressive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider boundaries. The author lives in the same house as their partner, so they might have equal claim to privacy. It's reasonable for someone to want to have their space and not have unexpected visitors. The author didn't say they dislike their partner's family; they just don't like the unannounced visits. The author did express their opinion calmly, pointing out their needs. However, the partner's family is used to this behavior, so there's a cultural or familial norm at play here. The partner is caught between her family's expectations and her partner's preferences.\n\nIs the author wrong? They have a valid point about personal space and privacy. The problem might be more about the partner's family not respecting the author's boundaries. The author might not have addressed the issue directly with the family before, leading to the current conflict. The partner might feel the author is being too rigid, but the author's stance is reasonable. The key is whether the author overstepped by stating their opinion, but they didn't do anything harmful. They just communicated their feelings. The partner's family's reaction might be a matter of them not respecting the author's boundaries rather than the author being in the wrong. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
