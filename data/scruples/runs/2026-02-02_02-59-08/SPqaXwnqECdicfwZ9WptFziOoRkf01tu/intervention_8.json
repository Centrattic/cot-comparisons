I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests.\n\nThe situation is that the author, their partner, and the partner's family just got back from Iceland. They had a nice meal at a fancy restaurant, and during the conversation, they discussed the partner's parents and their friends dropping by unannounced as a surprise. The partner and her sister like it, but the author doesn't. The author expressed their dislike, saying they might have things to do, want a day to themselves, and that the house might not be ready for unannounced visitors. This caused a divide because the partner feels it's unfair that her family can't just drop by, and the author is now seen by the partner's parents as aggressively opinionated.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants others' opinions.\n\nFirst, let me think about the key points. The author has a valid concern about unexpected guests disrupting their schedule or needing personal time. They are sharing their feelings in a conversation, which seems reasonable. The partner's family is used to this behavior, but the author has different boundaries. The partner is caught between her family's habits and her partner's preferences.\n\nIs it fair for the author to express their discomfort? Yes, because everyone has the right to express their boundaries. However, the way they did it might have come off as abrupt, especially since they usually don't voice their opinions. The partner's family feeling \"labelled\" as aggressively opinionated might be because the author didn't soften the message or consider the family's perspective.\n\nBut the core issue is about differing expectations in a shared living space. The author's house is also their partner's, so they have a right to set boundaries. The partner's family might not realize that the author has different needs. The author isn't being aggressive just for stating their preferences; they are advocating for their own space. However, maybe the author could have approached the conversation more constructively, perhaps by suggesting a compromise or finding a middle ground instead of a direct refusal.\n\nThe partner is upset because she feels her family's traditions are being challenged. The author's statement about the house being \"just as much theirs\" is valid, but the communication might have caused tension. It's a balance between respecting each other's family dynamics and personal boundaries.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for expressing their discomfort. It's about differing cultural or familial norms. The partner's family might need to adjust their expectations, and the author is justified in setting their boundaries. The answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
