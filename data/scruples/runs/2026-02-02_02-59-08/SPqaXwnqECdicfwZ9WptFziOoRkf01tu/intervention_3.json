I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about unexpected guests. The author and their partner's family just came back from Iceland and had a fancy dinner. During the meal, the topic of the partner's parents and friends showing up unannounced came up. The partner and her sister think it's a nice surprise, but the author doesn't like it because they might have things to do and sometimes want alone time. The author mentioned that the house might not be in order if people show up unannounced. Now there's a divide because the partner thinks it's unfair that her family can't just drop by, and the author's been labeled as aggressive for sharing their opinion.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but is curious. I need to decide if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the author's stance: they don't like unexpected guests because they need personal time and the house might not be clean. The partner's family sees it as a nice surprise. The key here is boundaries. The author is asserting their right to have their space and time, which is reasonable. Everyone needs personal space. The partner's family might have different expectations, but that doesn't mean the author is wrong for setting boundaries. The author is in a relationship, so it's about finding a middle ground, but the initial statement is about personal preferences. The author didn't act aggressively; they expressed their opinion. The family labeling them as aggressive seems like a misinterpretation. The partner's side is insisting on their way without considering the author's needs. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong. They have the right to their feelings. The problem is more on the partner's side for not respecting the author's boundaries and the family's reaction. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
