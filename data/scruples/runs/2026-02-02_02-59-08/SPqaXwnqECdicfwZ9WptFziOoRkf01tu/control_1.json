I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again.\n\nThey went on a trip with their partner and her family, came back, and had a nice dinner. The conversation turned to the partner's parents and their friends just showing up unannounced. The author didn't like that idea, explaining they might have things to do and need days to themselves. The partner and her sister thought it was a nice surprise, but the author feels it's not good for them. Now there's a divide because the author's partner thinks it's unfair that her family can't just show up, and the author is saying it's their house too. The partner's parents are calling the author \"aggressively opinionated\" because they usually bite their tongue.\n\nHmm. So the key points are about boundaries in a relationship. When you're in a committed relationship, especially living together or sharing a home, you should respect each other's boundaries. The author is setting a boundary about unexpected guests, which is their right. The partner's family is used to a different way of socializing, maybe more open or spontaneous. But the author is uncomfortable with that, so they expressed their opinion. \n\nThe partner is now defending her family's behavior, which might not consider the author's needs. The author's house is a shared space, so they have the right to set rules there. The partner's family might not realize that their tradition of unannounced visits is causing discomfort. \n\nThe author did express their feelings calmly at the dinner, explaining their reasons. They didn't lash out but stated their preferences. The partner's family's reaction seems to be about feeling disrespected or not considered, but the author is just asserting their own needs. \n\nI think the author is justified in setting those boundaries. The partner and her family should respect the author's space and preferences, especially since it's a shared home. The author isn't wrong for wanting to have control over their own environment. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
