I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break down this situation. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. They moved in with their partner and her family, and there's a conflict about surprise visits. The partner and her family see it as a nice gesture, but the author is against it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider personal boundaries. The author mentioned they have things to do and need alone time. That's a valid reason to not want unannounced guests. Everyone has different comfort levels with social interactions. The key point is that the author is expressing their preference, not necessarily being hostile. They even finished their point by mentioning not wanting the house messy, which is a practical concern.\n\nThe partner's family is upset, calling the author \"aggressively opinionated,\" but the author usually holds back their opinions. This suggests a communication style difference. The author is now asserting their boundaries, which the family isn't used to, leading to tension. \n\nIn relationships, especially when living together, mutual respect for each other's preferences is important. The author isn't being unreasonable here. They're stating their needs, which is healthy. The family might need to adjust, but the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
