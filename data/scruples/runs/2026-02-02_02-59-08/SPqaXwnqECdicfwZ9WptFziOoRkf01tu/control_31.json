I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author, their partner, and her family just returned from Iceland and had a reserved fancy meal. They discussed how the partner's parents and friends often show up unannounced. The partner and her sister think it's a nice surprise, but the author dislikes it. They explained they might have things to do, need some alone time, and don't want the house in disarray if someone shows up. Now, the partner is upset, feeling it's unfair her family can't just drop by. The author is being called overly opinionated by the in-laws.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are boundaries and mutual respect in a relationship. The author is part of a relationship with someone whose family has different social norms. The author is expressing their discomfort with unannounced visits, which is a reasonable boundary. They're sharing a house, so it's valid to want control over their living space and time. \n\nHowever, the partner's family might see this as being too rigid. But the author isn't stopping them from visiting; they're just asking for advance notice. The author's explanation seems reasonable. The partner's reaction might stem from not expecting this pushback, especially if they usually don't express such opinions. \n\nThe author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. It's important in relationships to communicate needs. The issue here is more about differing expectations and the partner's family not respecting those boundaries. The author hasn't done anything that would be considered wrong; they're advocating for their own needs. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
