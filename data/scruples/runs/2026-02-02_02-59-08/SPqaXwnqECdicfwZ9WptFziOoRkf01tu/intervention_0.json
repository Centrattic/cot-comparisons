I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. The situation is that the author and their partner's family just came back from Iceland and had dinner. The author expressed discomfort with friends dropping by unannounced, leading to tension with the partner and her parents.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. In some families, dropping by without notice is common and seen as friendly. But others value privacy and notice. The author's partner seems to support her family's habits, which might be a cultural difference. The author is standing up for their own boundaries, which is important. But maybe they could have communicated it more gently? The partner feels it's unfair, so there's a conflict here between the author's need for privacy and the partner's family traditions. \n\nThe author's response was about having things to do, needing a day to themselves, and not wanting the house messy. These are valid points. However, the partner and her family might see it as the author not being flexible or inclusive. The author is asserting their home's shared ownership, which makes sense. But the partner might feel the author is being too rigid. \n\nThe key is whether the author overstepped. They expressed their opinion, but maybe without considering the partner's perspective. The partner might feel caught between two sides. The author's approach might have been too direct, leading to being labeled as aggressive. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's more about boundaries versus family traditions. The author isn't in the wrong for having their own preferences and stating them, but perhaps could have handled it differently. However, the question is if the author is at fault. Since the issue is about differing expectations, both sides have valid points. The author is not in the wrong for expressing their needs. So the answer would be B.\n"
