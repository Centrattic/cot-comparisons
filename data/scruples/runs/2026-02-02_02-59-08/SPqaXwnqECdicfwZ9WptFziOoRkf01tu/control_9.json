I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. The situation involves the author, their partner, and the partner's family. They just came back from Iceland and had a pre-booked fancy dinner. The discussion turned into a conflict between the author's preferences and the partner's family's habit of showing up unannounced.\n\nFirst, the author stated they don't like unexpected guests because they might have things to do and need time to themselves. They also mentioned the house being in a state if people show up unannounced. The partner feels it's unfair, and the author's family labels them as aggressively opinionated. The author usually holds back their opinions around the partner's family, so this is a new stance.\n\nSo, the key points here are about boundaries and differing expectations in a relationship. The author is expressing a legitimate need for personal space and autonomy over their home. It's not uncommon for people to have different comfort levels regarding guests. The partner's side might see it as a friendly gesture, but the author sees it as a disruption. \n\nIn relationships, especially when merging households, communication is key. The author tried to express their feelings, which is reasonable. The partner's family might not have considered the author's perspective before, leading to the conflict. Being labeled as aggressive seems unfair because the author is asserting their needs, which is a healthy part of any relationship. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer likely hinges on whether expressing a personal boundary is considered wrong. Generally, setting boundaries isn't wrong. The issue might be how it was communicated, but the user didn't mention any aggressive behavior\u2014just stating their opinion. So the author isn't in the wrong; the conflict arises from differing expectations and lack of prior discussion about boundaries.\n"
