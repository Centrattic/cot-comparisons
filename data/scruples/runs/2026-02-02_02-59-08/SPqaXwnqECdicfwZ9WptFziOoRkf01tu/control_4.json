I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's partner's family showing up unannounced, and the author expressing discomfort with that. The partner and her family see it as a nice surprise, but the author feels it's intrusive. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author and their partner are in a relationship, sharing a house. The author's partner's family has a habit of dropping by without notice. The author expressed their dislike for this, mentioning needing personal time and not wanting to have to clean up unexpectedly. The partner is upset, feeling it's unfair, and the family labels the author as \"aggressively opinionated.\"\n\nSo, the main issue is boundaries and mutual respect. When two people are in a relationship and share a living space, they need to respect each other's preferences. The author is setting a boundary, which is their right. The partner's family's behavior seems to be a cultural or family norm, but that doesn't automatically make it right. The author isn't being aggressive; they're stating their needs calmly. The partner's family might be used to a different way of socializing, but the author has every right to expect that their living space isn't invaded without notice. \n\nThe divide here is likely because the partner is prioritizing her family's habits over her partner's comfort. The author is not wrong for wanting to maintain personal space and privacy in their own home. The family's reaction seems dismissive of the author's legitimate concerns. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. They're standing up for their needs, which is healthy in any relationship. The partner and her family need to adjust their expectations to respect the author's boundaries.\n"
