I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation is about unexpected guests.\n\nThe author shares that after returning from a trip, they had a pre-booked fancy dinner. During the meal, they discussed how their partner's parents and friends just show up as surprises. The author expressed that they don't like this because they might have things to do or need a day to themselves, and they don't want the house messy. Now, the partner and her family are upset, with the parents labeling the author as aggressively opinionated.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about boundaries and communication. The author is sharing their discomfort with unexpected guests, which is a valid personal preference. They mentioned that they usually hold back their opinions but finally expressed them. The partner and family are taking it as an issue, but the author is asserting their own space and needs. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to communicate one's needs, especially regarding personal space. The author isn't being rude about it; they explained their reasons. The family's reaction seems to be about not respecting the author's boundaries. Since the house is shared, both parties should respect each other's preferences. The author isn't wrong for setting a boundary. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
