I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about unexpected guests. The person (the author) doesn't like their partner's family showing up unannounced, and they expressed this opinion. The partner and her family are upset, saying it's unfair, and the author is labeled as aggressive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author shares a house with their partner, so it's their home too. The right to have personal space and privacy is important. The author mentioned they usually hold back their opinions but this time spoke up. That might have caused tension because the family is used to certain behavior.\n\nThe key points are: the author expressed their discomfort with unannounced visits, which is reasonable. People have different social norms; some like spontaneity, others need notice. The author's partner is taking their side against the author, which complicates things. The family might feel their traditions or expectations are being challenged. \n\nBut the author isn't wrong for wanting to have control over their own home. It's a common issue where boundaries are necessary. The partner's family might not realize the author's perspective. The divide is more about differing expectations than one side being right or wrong. However, the author isn't in the wrong for stating their boundaries. So the answer should be B, No.\n"
