I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author expressing discomfort with unexpected guests, which led to conflict with their partner and her family.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author shares that they don't like surprise visits because they might have other plans or need personal time. They mention that the house is \"just as much theirs as it is the partner's,\" indicating that they have a stake in the household's environment. The partner and her family seem to value these spontaneous visits as a nice gesture, but the author's opposition has caused a rift.\n\nThe author's main argument is about personal space and autonomy. They state they usually hold their opinions around the family but now feel compelled to voice their discomfort. The partner and in-laws are reacting negatively, labeling the author as \"aggressively opinionated,\" which might be due to the sudden change in the author's behavior after usually being more reserved.\n\nNow, considering cultural norms around hospitality and privacy. In some cultures, surprise visits are seen as a sign of closeness and care, while others prioritize individual privacy and notice. The author's stance on needing advance notice is valid as it relates to personal boundaries. The partner's expectation that family can drop by as they please might not account for the author's need for control over their living space.\n\nThe author's response was direct but not necessarily hostile. They explained their reasons clearly, which is reasonable. However, the timing of expressing this opinion might have been problematic if it was a sudden change without prior discussion. The partner's reaction could stem from feeling that the author is restricting family interactions, which are important to them.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, asserting one's boundaries isn't inherently wrong. The author has the right to expect that their living space isn't intruded upon without notice. However, the manner in which the author communicated their feelings might have been abrupt, especially if they usually didn't voice such opinions before. The partner might feel blindsided, leading to the current conflict.\n\nBut the core issue is the author's right to privacy versus the family's tradition of spontaneous visits. The author isn't wrong for wanting to maintain their space. The partner's family might need to adjust their expectations, considering the author's perspective. So, in this case, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for setting boundaries, even if it caused tension. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
