I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author expressing discomfort with unexpected guests. They went on a trip with their partner and her family, and upon returning, there's a disagreement about surprise visits.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author's partner and her family see these surprise visits as a nice gesture. The author, however, prefers boundaries and mentioned that they might have things to do or need a day to themselves. The author also mentioned the house state as a concern. The partner is now upset, saying it's unfair, and the author is labeled as aggressive for finally expressing their opinion.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong for not wanting unexpected guests. The author is sharing their feelings here. The main issue is about personal boundaries. The author's house is shared with their partner, so they have a right to set rules. However, the partner's family is used to this tradition, and the partner is defending them. \n\nIs it wrong to have different preferences? The author isn't being aggressive; they're stating their needs. The problem arises when the partner and family don't respect those boundaries. The author's stance is about respecting their own space. On the other hand, the partner's family might see it as a cultural or familial norm. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author tried to express their feelings, which is the right step. The partner and family's reaction might stem from not understanding the author's perspective. The author isn't in the wrong for having boundaries. The partner might need to mediate between both sides. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). They have a valid reason to prefer not having unexpected guests, especially in their shared home. It's about mutual respect and compromise between the couple.\n"
