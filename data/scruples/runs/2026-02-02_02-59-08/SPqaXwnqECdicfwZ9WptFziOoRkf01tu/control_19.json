I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. The situation involves the author's partner and her family, who are used to dropping by each other's houses as a surprise. The author expressed their discomfort with this, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider boundaries in relationships. The author lives in a house that's shared, so they have a right to set boundaries about unexpected guests. The partner's family might see this as a cultural or social norm, but the author is making it clear that they prefer to have control over their space and time. \n\nThe author's partner is upset because she feels the family can't just show up. The author is standing their ground, which is important for mutual respect. The key here is whether expressing a preference for advance notice and personal space is reasonable. \n\nCultural differences could play a role. If the partner's family is used to this kind of unannounced visit, they might not realize it's intrusive. However, the author has a valid point about needing personal time and maintaining the house's state. \n\nThe partner labeling the author as \"aggressively opinionated\" seems unfair if the author merely expressed their opinion without being hostile. It's important to communicate boundaries without being confrontational, but the author's stance isn't wrong just for having different preferences. \n\nIn relationships, both parties need to compromise. The author isn't wrong for setting limits; they're advocating for their needs. The partner and her family need to adjust their behavior to respect the author's space. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
