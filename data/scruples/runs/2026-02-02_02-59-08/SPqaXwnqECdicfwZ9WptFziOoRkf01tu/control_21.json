I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not liking unexpected guests showing up at their home, which is shared with their partner and her family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author and their partner had a disagreement about unannounced visits. The author expressed their discomfort, mentioning that they might have things to do and need alone time. The partner and her family see it as a nice surprise, but the author feels it's unfair, especially since it's their house too. The partner is upset, and the author is now seen as aggressive by the in-laws.\n\nNow, thinking about boundaries. When people live together, they should respect each other's space and preferences. The author is standing up for their own needs, which is reasonable. It's common for couples to have different expectations regarding guests, especially from family. The author's partner seems to be defending her family's habits without considering the author's feelings. The author's house should be a shared space where both partners' comfort is respected. The fact that the author usually holds back their opinions but now expressed them might be causing tension, but that doesn't make their stance wrong. The family's reaction to labeling the author as aggressive is a bit harsh if they didn't consider the author's perspective.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the partner should have mediated the situation earlier. The author's right to have personal space and set boundaries is valid. However, communication is key. But in this case, the author did communicate, and the conflict arose from differing views, not from the author being wrong. The author isn't being unreasonable here. They're asserting their needs in a shared living situation. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
