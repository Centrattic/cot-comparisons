I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. The situation is that they, their partner, and her family returned from Iceland and had a fancy dinner. During the meal, they discussed how the partner's family and parents visit each other without notice. The partner and her sister think it's a nice surprise, but the author disagrees. The author mentioned they might be busy, need time alone, and that the house should be presentable. Now there's tension because the partner feels it's unfair that the family can't drop by, and the author is seen as being \"aggressively opinionated\" by her parents.\n\nFirst, boundaries. The author is expressing their discomfort with unscheduled visits. It's reasonable to want control over one's schedule and personal space. The fact that it's their house and they share it with their partner implies they should have a say in how it's used. The partner's family might not realize the impact of their actions, especially if this is a cultural norm for them. But the author isn't wrong to set boundaries. The partner's reaction seems to be about fairness, but the author's perspective is equally valid. The key here is mutual respect. The author isn't being aggressive; they're stating their needs. The parents labeling them as aggressive suggests a lack of understanding, which isn't the author's fault. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
