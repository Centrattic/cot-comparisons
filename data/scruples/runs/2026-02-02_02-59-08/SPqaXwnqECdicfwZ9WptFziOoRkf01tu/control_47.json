I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. The situation involves the author, their partner, and the partner's family. The main issue is the author's discomfort with surprise visits, which the partner's family sees as a nice gesture.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author explains that they value their privacy and having days to themselves without interruptions. They also mention that the house is as much theirs as the partner's, which is a valid point about shared space. The partner and her family, on the other hand, see these surprise visits as positive and normal, and they're upset that the author is objecting. \n\nThe key factors here are consent and boundaries. When someone shares a home with others, especially in a committed relationship, both parties should respect each other's needs. The author isn't against socializing per se, but they want control over when guests come. The partner's family might not realize that unannounced visits can be intrusive, especially if the person isn't expecting company. \n\nThe author's response was to express their feelings, which is reasonable. They didn't act out or cause the issue; they communicated their preferences. The family's reaction labels the author as \"aggressively opinionated,\" which suggests they might be defensive or not considering the author's valid concerns. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to find a balance between family traditions and individual needs. The author isn't wrong for wanting to set boundaries. The partner and her family might need to adjust their behavior to respect the author's space. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
