I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. The situation involves the author, their partner, and her family. They just came back from a trip and had a planned meal. The discussion arose about the partner's parents and friends showing up unannounced. The author expressed discomfort with this, explaining they need time to themselves and don't want the house in disarray. The partner's family now sees the author as aggressive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. In some cultures, dropping by unannounced is common and seen as friendly, while others might find it intrusive. The author's concern about personal space and time is valid. However, the way they communicated it might have come off as harsh. They mentioned the house being in a state, which could imply judgment of the family's habits. \n\nThe partner's side sees it as a nice surprise, so the author's opposition might clash with the family's traditions. The author's approach was to express their dislike, which is reasonable, but maybe the phrasing could have been more diplomatic. The key is whether the author overstepped by not allowing for the family's customs. \n\nAlso, the author usually holds their tongue, so this was a rare time they spoke up. The family's reaction might be due to not being used to having their habits questioned. The author's right to their own space is important, but so is respecting the partner's family's ways. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for setting boundaries, but could have been more tactful. The answer should be B (No) because expressing valid concerns about personal space isn't wrong, even if communication could be improved.\n"
