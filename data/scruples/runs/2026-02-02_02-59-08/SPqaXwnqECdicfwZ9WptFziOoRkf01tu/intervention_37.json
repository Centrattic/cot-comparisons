I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again.\n\nThe author, their partner, and the partner's family came back from Iceland and had a fancy dinner planned. They discussed the partner's parents and their friends showing up unannounced as a surprise. The partner and her sister like it, but the author doesn't. The author explained they don't like it because they might have things to do or need a day to themselves without people bothering them. They also mentioned not wanting the house to be messy if people show up unannounced. Now, the partner is saying it's unfair the author doesn't let her family come over, and the author is seen as aggressive by the partner's parents. The author is asking if they're at fault.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user initially thought the author was in the wrong but wants to know my opinion. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the key points are about unexpected guests. The author is not comfortable with people showing up without notice. The partner's family sees it as a nice surprise, but the author feels it's intrusive. The author's home is a shared space; they mention it's as much theirs as the partner's. The conflict arises from differing expectations about personal space and boundaries.\n\nI need to consider cultural norms here. In some cultures, unexpected visits are common and seen as friendly. However, in others, people prefer to call ahead. The problem might be that the author's partner's family has different expectations, and the author is asserting their own boundaries. The author's partner is caught between her family's habits and her partner's preferences.\n\nThe author tried to explain their perspective calmly, stating they have tasks or need personal time. They didn't forbid guests entirely but expressed discomfort with unannounced visits. The partner's family might not have considered the author's perspective, especially if they're used to a more flexible approach. However, the author's home is their space, so they have a right to set boundaries.\n\nThe partner is upset that the author won't allow her family to visit unexpectedly. The partner might feel that the author is being too rigid or not accommodating her family's traditions. The author might be seen as being inconsiderate of the partner's family's feelings. But at the same time, the author is asserting their own needs and the importance of their home's privacy.\n\nIs the author wrong for not wanting unexpected guests? It depends on context. If the home is shared, the author has a right to set rules about visitors. However, communication is key. The author might have approached it more gently or discussed boundaries earlier. But in this case, they did express their feelings, and the conflict arose from differing viewpoints. The partner's family might need to adjust their behavior if they're staying in the author's home. Alternatively, maybe the author could compromise by allowing planned visits but not unexpected ones. \n\nThe key here is mutual respect. The author isn't wrong for having preferences about their home. The partner's family might be wrong for not respecting those boundaries. However, the author could be more flexible if the partner's family's expectations are part of the partner's culture. But the author is also within their rights to set limits. The conflict is more about clashing values rather than a clear right or wrong.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have a valid reason for not liking unexpected guests and are asserting their boundaries. The partner's family might need to adjust to the shared home's rules. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
