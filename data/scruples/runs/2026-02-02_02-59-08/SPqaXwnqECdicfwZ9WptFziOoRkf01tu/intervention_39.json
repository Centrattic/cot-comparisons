I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not liking unexpected guests, which caused a conflict with their partner's family.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author, their partner, and partner's family returned from Iceland and had a meal. During the meal, they discussed how the partner's parents and friends often show up unannounced. The partner and her sister think it's a nice surprise, but the author doesn't like it because they might have things to do and sometimes need a day to themselves. The author mentioned that they don't want the house to be messy if people show up without notice. This led to a disagreement, with the partner feeling it's unfair and the author's house being as much theirs as the partner's. The partner's parents now see the author as aggressively opinionated.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants others' opinions. The answer needs to be A or B. \n\nNow, considering cultural norms and boundaries. In many Western cultures, unsolicited visits are increasingly seen as a breach of personal space, especially if not discussed beforehand. The author is expressing their discomfort, which is a valid right. The partner's family might come from a culture where such visits are common, but that doesn't mean the author is wrong to set boundaries. The key here is mutual respect. The author isn't forbidding all visits, just expressing a preference. The partner's family's reaction seems to be invalidating the author's feelings. \n\nThe author's argument about the house being shared is important. If it's their home, they should have a say in how it's managed. The partner's parents labeling the author as aggressive suggests they might not be listening to the author's perspective. The author isn't being hostile, just setting boundaries. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to their preferences and to communicate them without being labeled negatively. The partner's family's reaction is more problematic because they're not respecting the author's boundaries. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
