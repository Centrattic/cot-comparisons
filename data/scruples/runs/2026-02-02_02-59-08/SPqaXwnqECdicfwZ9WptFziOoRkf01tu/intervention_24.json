I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about unexpected guests at their home after a trip. The author's partner and her family are okay with surprise visits, but the author isn't. The author expressed their discomfort, and now there's tension.\n\nFirst, the author is sharing their feelings. They mentioned they might be busy or need alone time and that they don't want the house to be messy. That seems reasonable. It's their home too, so they have a right to set boundaries. The partner's family might have different social norms, but that doesn't mean the author is wrong for having their own preferences. \n\nThe author's partner is upset because her family thinks they should be able to drop by. But the author is asserting their right to the space. The key here is mutual respect. The author isn't being aggressive; they're setting boundaries. The family's reaction of labeling them as \"aggressively opinionated\" might be a misunderstanding. \n\nI think the author is justified in their stance. They're not being inconsiderate; they're sharing their needs. The partner's family might need to adjust, but the author isn't wrong. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
