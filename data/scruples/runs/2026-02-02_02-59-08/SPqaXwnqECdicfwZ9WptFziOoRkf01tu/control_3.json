I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is at fault. The scenario is about whether it's wrong to not like unexpected guests.\n\nSo, the person, their partner, and the partner's family came back from Iceland and had a planned dinner. During the meal, they discussed how the partner's parents and friends often show up as surprises. The partner and her sister like it, but the person doesn't. They explained that they don't like it because they might have things to do or want alone time, and also mentioned the house being in order. Now, the partner says it's unfair, and the person is called aggressive for finally sharing their opinion.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about boundaries and mutual respect in a relationship. The person is asserting their preference, which is valid. Everyone has different comfort levels with social interactions. The partner's family seems to have a different norm, but that doesn't mean the person is wrong for not liking it. The house is shared, so both partners' needs should be considered. The person isn't being aggressive necessarily; they're expressing their feelings after biting their tongue before. The partner's family might need to adjust their behavior too.\n\nI think the person isn't in the wrong. They have a right to their preferences, especially in their own space. So the answer is B.\n"
