I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author, their partner, and partner's family came back from Iceland and had a fancy dinner booked. During the meal, the topic of the partner's parents and friends showing up unannounced came up. The author expressed that they don't like this because they might have things to do and sometimes need a day to themselves. They also mentioned not wanting the house to be messy if someone shows up unexpectedly. This caused a divide, with the partner feeling that the family shouldn't have to worry about that, and the author's partner's parents labeling them as \"aggressively opinionated.\"\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants others' opinions. I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nFirst, the concept of house rules and boundaries. It's common for people to have different expectations when it comes to guests. The author is stating their preference clearly, but the partner's family is used to a different norm. The key points here are communication and mutual respect. The author mentioned the house is as much theirs as the partner's, which is a valid point. However, maybe they could have communicated this in a more collaborative way with their partner first, rather than bringing it up in front of the family during dinner. \n\nBut on the other hand, the author's reasons are understandable. They value their personal time and privacy. It's reasonable to want to avoid unannounced visits, especially if it disrupts their schedule or makes the house messy. The partner's family might be used to a more open lifestyle, so there's a clash in expectations. \n\nThe problem here is the communication approach. The author brought up their preferences in a public setting (dinner) with the partner's family, which might have caused immediate defensiveness. Instead, perhaps discussing this with the partner beforehand to align on boundaries could have been better. However, the author isn't necessarily \"in the wrong\" for having those preferences. It's more about how it was communicated and whether there was prior discussion. \n\nThe partner's family's reaction seems a bit harsh, calling the author \"aggressively opinionated\" might be an overreaction. The author was expressing a valid concern. The partner might not be considering the author's perspective, thinking it's unfair, but that's a different issue. \n\nIn summary, the author isn't in the wrong for having their preferences. The mistake might be in how the communication happened, but their stance itself is reasonable. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
