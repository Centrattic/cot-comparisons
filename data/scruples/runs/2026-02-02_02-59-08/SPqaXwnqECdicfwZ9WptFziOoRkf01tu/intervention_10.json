I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again.\n\nThe author and their partner, along with her family, just came back from Iceland and had a pre-booked fancy meal. During the meal, they talked about the partner's parents and their friends showing up unannounced. The author doesn't like that and expressed it by saying they don't like unexpected guests because they might have things to do and sometimes need a day to themselves. They also mentioned that the house might not be ready for surprise visits. Now, this has caused a divide because the partner thinks it's unfair the author doesn't like their unannounced visits. The author usually holds back their opinions around the partner's family, but this time they spoke up, leading to being called \"aggressively opinionated.\"\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the author is sharing their own preferences. They're not saying it's illegal or that the partner's family is doing something wrong, just that they personally don't like it. That seems reasonable. People have different boundaries. The partner and her family might see surprise visits as friendly, but the author has valid reasons for not liking them. The author did state their opinion calmly, mentioning their need for personal time and the state of the house. That's about setting boundaries, which is important in relationships.\n\nHowever, the partner is upset because she thinks it's unfair her family can't just visit. But the house is shared, so both parties should have input. The author isn't forbidding visits entirely but is expressing a preference. The fact that the author usually holds back their opinions might mean they were being truthful this time, which is a good thing. Being honest is necessary for a healthy relationship.\n\nThe partner's family labeling the author as \"aggressively opinionated\" seems harsh. The author's statement was about their own feelings and needs, not attacking the family. It's possible the family didn't take it well, but the author isn't wrong for expressing their boundaries. The key here is mutual respect. Both sides need to respect each other's preferences. If the partner expects her family to visit without notice, but the author doesn't want that, there's a conflict in expectations that needs to be addressed, but the author isn't in the wrong for stating their side.\n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they're asserting their boundaries in a shared living situation, which is necessary for a healthy relationship. The partner and family should consider the author's perspective as well.\n"
