It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for kicking his pregnant girlfriend out after finding out the child isn't his.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the situation. The author and his ex were together for two years, had a rocky relationship, then he broke up with her. She lost her job, and he was supporting her. He suspected her of cheating. Later, she came back saying she's pregnant, and he agreed to let her stay temporarily, arranging a paternity test. After the test showed the child isn't his, he kicked her out. Now, people are telling him he's a bad person for not helping the unborn child, especially since the mother lives with smokers.\n\nThe main ethical points here are paternity responsibility, emotional state, and societal expectations. Legally, in many places, biological paternity doesn't automatically grant legal fatherhood unless established through a court or acknowledgment. Since the test showed he's not the father, he's not legally obligated to support the child. However, if he had accepted the child as his own, that might complicate things, but in this case, he wanted the test first, which shows he was cautious.\n\nEmotionally, the author is dealing with the betrayal of cheating and the stress of the pregnancy. He might feel wronged and not want to support someone else's child. But others argue that the child is innocent and deserves help regardless of the parents' issues. There's a debate about whether the father (even if not biological) has a moral obligation once he's involved in the pregnancy.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might be in a vulnerable emotional state, and it's reasonable for him to prioritize his own mental health, especially if he hasn't committed to being a father. The mother's actions, including cheating and not working, also play a role. However, the child's well-being is a separate concern. \n\nBut the question is about whether he's in the wrong. If he's not the biological father, and didn't commit to being the father, then legally he's not responsible. However, morally, some might argue that once he agreed to support the pregnancy, he should follow through. But others would say he's not obligated if the child isn't his.\n\nThe key points: The author is not the biological father, he wanted a paternity test, and after the test, he decided to end the arrangement. Since he's not the father, he's not legally responsible. Emotionally, he's justified in needing space after the betrayal. However, the child is still a human being, and some people might expect the author to help regardless. But without a legal or prior commitment, maybe he's not in the wrong. Alternatively, if he had started providing support, even temporarily, some might argue he has a moral obligation now. But since the paternity was proven false, and he wasn't the father, it's a gray area. \n\nIn terms of social standards, society often expects people to help children in need, but the author's personal circumstances and the cheating might mitigate that expectation. So the answer hinges on whether one believes the author is morally obligated to support a child that isn't his, especially after discovering the mother's infidelity. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer could be B (No), because he's not the father and isn't legally obligated, and his emotional state is a factor. However, if there's a moral obligation to help regardless, then A (Yes). But the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the answer is whether he did something unethical, the line is blurry. Since he's not the father and didn't commit to being the father, maybe he's not in the wrong. So the answer would be B.\n"
