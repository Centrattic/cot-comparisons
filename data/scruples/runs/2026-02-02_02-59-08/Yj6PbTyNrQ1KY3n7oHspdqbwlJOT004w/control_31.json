It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is complicated. The user found out the child isn't his and then kicked his pregnant ex out. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the couple had been together for two years, but the last months were rocky. The ex lost her job and wasn't looking for work, relying on the user's financial support. The user suspected cheating and broke up, leading her to live with her parents. Then she came back saying she was pregnant, and the user let her stay again, but with a paternity test. The test showed the child isn't his, so he kicked her out. Now people are saying he's a bad person for not helping the unborn child.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the user was wrong to kick her out after the paternity test. Let's consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, in most places, the user isn't the legal father if the test proves it. So he doesn't have a legal obligation to support the child. However, morally, it's more complex. The user is dealing with emotional betrayal and the stress of possibly being a father, which was confirmed not to be his case. He might feel justified in cutting ties, especially after the cheating and the financial strain. \n\nBut then there's the unborn child's well-being. The user allowed her to stay initially to protect the child from cigarette smoke. Now that the child isn't his, he's leaving her with her parents, who smoke. That could be a concern for the child's health. However, the user isn't legally responsible, so maybe it's up to the mother to ensure the child's safety. \n\nThe user is also dealing with emotional trauma. He might be in a vulnerable state, which could affect his judgment. On the other hand, the ex might be in a difficult situation too, needing support. But the user isn't obligated to provide it. \n\nIs the user a piece of shit for not helping? It's a moral question. Some might say he's justified because it's not his child and he's been through betrayal. Others might argue he should help regardless. \n\nIn terms of fairness to the unborn child, the user isn't the father, so it's not his responsibility. However, if he's willing to help, that's up to him. The key here is whether he has a duty. Legally no, but morally, some might say yes, but others might say he's within his rights to step back. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's not the legal father and the decision was based on his emotional state and prior issues. But it's a tough call because the child's welfare is involved. Yet, the legal and ethical lines are clearer here without a paternal obligation.\n"
