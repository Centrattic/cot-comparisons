It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant girlfriend after discovering the child isn't his.\n\nFirst, the situation: The man and his ex had a rocky relationship, he ended it because she was unemployed and he suspected her of cheating. She came back pregnant, he agreed to let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. The test proved the child wasn't his, so he asked her to leave. Now, others are criticizing him for not supporting the child.\n\nSo, key points to consider: Legal responsibility, emotional state, rights of the unborn child, and societal expectations.\n\nLegally, if the child isn't his, he has no obligation to support it financially. However, the moral aspect is trickier. Even if he's not the biological father, he might feel a moral responsibility, especially if he was considering being a father before the test. Also, the ex might be the mother, so she has responsibility, but the man's role here is non-biological.\n\nEmotionally, he's been through a lot\u2014cheating, financial strain, emotional turmoil. His reaction is understandable from a personal standpoint. But others argue that he should help regardless. However, he isn't legally bound to do so, and it's his home. \n\nThe unborn child's well-being is a concern. If the mother is staying with friends to avoid smoke, maybe the child's safety is being considered. But the man's home is a better environment. However, since he's not the father, he's not obligated to provide shelter. \n\nSociety might pressure him to help, but that's not the same as being in the wrong. The question is about right and wrong, not societal opinion. Legally, he's not wrong. Morally, it's debatable. If he feels he's done his part by considering and then having the test, and then making a decision based on the result, he's not in the wrong. The ex's actions (cheating, job issues) contributed to the breakup, so his decision to end the relationship after finding out the child isn't his seems justified.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer would be B\u2014No, he's not in the wrong. He made a decision based on the paternity test result, which legally and morally (depending on perspective) absolves him of responsibility. Others might feel he should help, but that doesn't make him wrong.\n"
