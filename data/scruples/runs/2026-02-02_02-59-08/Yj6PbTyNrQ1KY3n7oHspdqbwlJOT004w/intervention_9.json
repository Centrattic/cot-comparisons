It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the given situation is in the wrong. The author kicked his pregnant girlfriend out after finding out the child isn't his. The options are to answer A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to unpack the situation. The ex and the author were together for two years but the relationship was rocky, especially after she lost her job and wasn't contributing financially. He suspected cheating and broke up with her, leading her to move in with her parents. Then she came back to tell him she's pregnant, and he agreed to let her stay under the condition of a paternity test. The test shows the child isn't his, and he kicks her out.\n\nThe author is facing criticism from others who think he should support the child regardless. He's conflicted between his emotional state and the external pressure. The key points here are: paternity test results, the woman's history of cheating, the financial strain, and the child's well-being.\n\nLegally, if the child is not his, he's not obligated to provide support. Emotionally, he might feel betrayed, especially if she cheated. However, the child is innocent, so there's a moral aspect. But the author didn't ask to be the father, and the mother is responsible for her actions. \n\nThe woman's behavior during the relationship\u2014being financially dependent, possibly cheating\u2014might affect the author's responsibility. But the child's well-being is a consideration. However, the author isn't the biological father, so his duty is questionable. \n\nOthers are pressuring him to take her in, but it's his home and his emotional state is a factor. The question is whether he's in the wrong for not providing a home when he's not the father. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because he's not legally obligated, and the mother's actions led to the situation. However, there's a moral aspect where he could choose to help if he feels it's right. But the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" which implies wrongdoing. Since he's not legally responsible and the mother is, he's not in the wrong.\n"
