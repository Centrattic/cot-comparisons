It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant ex when he found out the child isn't his. Hmm.\n\nFirst, the situation: They were together for two years, then broke up because she lost her job and he felt she wasn't contributing financially. He suspected cheating. She came back saying she's pregnant, he lets her stay but insists on a paternity test. The test comes back negative, and he kicks her out. Now, people are saying he's being a bad person.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's wrong. Let me break it down. Legally, if he's not the father, he doesn't have a legal obligation to support the child. But morally? That's trickier. He's not the father, so maybe he doesn't have a responsibility. But she's in a vulnerable position, and he's providing a home. However, he was already in a stressful situation, had a bad breakup, and discovered she cheated. The emotional toll on him is significant.\n\nOn the other hand, the ex is pregnant and needs support. Her parents are smoking, so staying with a friend is better. But he's being accused of being selfish. But he's making a choice based on the fact that he's not the father. If he feels he can't support someone else's child, is that his right? Or is he being callous?\n\nI think there's a balance here. If he's not the father, maybe he's not obligated. But if he had already agreed to let her stay under the assumption he's the father, maybe there's an expectation of support. But once the truth comes out, he's under no obligation. So perhaps he's not in the wrong. However, some might argue that once you're involved, you have a moral duty. But if the paternity test negates that, maybe not. I'm leaning towards B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
