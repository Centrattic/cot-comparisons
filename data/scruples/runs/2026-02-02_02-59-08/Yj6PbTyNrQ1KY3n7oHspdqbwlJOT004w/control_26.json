It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he kicked his pregnant ex out after finding out the baby isn't his. They had a breakup a few weeks before when she lost her job and wasn't working. He took her back temporarily to let her stay because her mom smokes, and they agreed to a paternity test. After the test showed he's not the father, he made her leave again.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the facts. He was in a relationship, she was pregnant, he believed the child might be his. He supported her financially before, then took her in again after the breakup for the paternity test. Once he found out it wasn't his, he let her leave. Now, the question is whether he's wrong for not keeping her there.\n\nHe mentions he suspected she was cheating, which was confirmed later. That adds to the betrayal. He's dealing with emotional turmoil. The friends are saying he's a bad person for not helping the child. But the child isn't his. So legally, there's no obligation for him to support someone else's child. However, morally, does he have a responsibility?\n\nOn one hand, he's not the father, so no legal duty. On the other hand, maybe he has some moral responsibility if he was involved in her life and helped her before. But after the betrayal and the child not being his, it's understandable he doesn't want to take care of it. The ex is staying with a friend, so maybe she's getting support elsewhere. \n\nHe's also under a lot of stress from the cheating and the emotional rollercoaster. The friends are pressuring him, but he's not the father, so their arguments might not hold. The key here is whether he's obligated to help someone else's child. Since the child isn't his, and he's not in a legal or parental relationship with them, it's his choice. So, maybe he's not in the wrong. But some might argue he should help regardless. But legally and morally, it's his right to not do so. So the answer is B.\n"
