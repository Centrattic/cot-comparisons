It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the details carefully.\n\nThe person had a 2-year relationship with his ex, which got rocky when she lost her job and didn't look for work, leading to financial strain. He suspected cheating and broke up, she went to live with her parents. Then she came back saying she's pregnant, and he let her stay again because her mom smokes. They agreed to a paternity test. After it came back negative, he kicked her out. Now, people are calling him a bad person for not helping the unborn child. He's conflicted, feeling emotionally raw and wondering if he was wrong.\n\nFirst, legal stuff: If the paternity test proved he's not the father, then legally he's not responsible for the child. So there's no legal obligation here. But the question is about moral or ethical wrong.\n\nMoral perspective: He let her stay because he thought it was his child. Once he found out it wasn't, he's not obligated to keep supporting someone else's child. But there's the argument about the child's well-being. However, the child isn't the one who cheated; the mother is. The man's trust was broken, and he's dealing with betrayal. \n\nBut then again, maybe he should consider helping the mother, even if it's not his child. But he's already been through a lot. The mother was the one who didn't look for work, cheated, and now is staying with a friend to avoid her parents. His home is the only option for her? But he's not required to provide that. \n\nSo, the main factors are: paternity test result, his emotional state, and the mother's actions. He's under no obligation to support someone else's child. The mother's friends are pressuring him, but that doesn't make his actions wrong. \n\nIn terms of fairness to the unborn child, the child isn't at fault. But the parent is the mother. The man's responsibility is to his own well-being and the truth. Since he's not the father, he's not in the wrong for not taking on that responsibility. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). Because he's not the father, and he had an agreement for the test. Once the test cleared that, he's not obligated anymore. The mother's actions led to the situation, and the child isn't to blame. He's allowed to prioritize his own mental health after betrayal and stress.\n"
