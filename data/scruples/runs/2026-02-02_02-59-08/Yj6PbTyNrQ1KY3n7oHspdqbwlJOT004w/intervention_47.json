It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for kicking their pregnant girlfriend out after finding out the child isn't theirs. \n\nFirst, the boyfriend and girlfriend were together for two years, then broke up due to her not working and him suspecting cheating. She came back saying she's pregnant, and they agreed to a paternity test. The test showed it's not his, so he kicked her out. Now people are saying he's being unfair.\n\nHmm. Legally, he's not the father, so he has no obligation to support the child. But morally, it's trickier. He was initially supportive when he thought he might be the father, but after the test, he changed his mind. The woman might be in a bad situation with her parents, but he's also dealing with betrayal and emotional stress.\n\nHe had to financially support her before, and she was living off him. Now, even though the child isn't his, he's being pressured to take her in. But he's not responsible for someone else's child. On the other hand, she might need help, but that's her responsibility to seek elsewhere. \n\nHe's not in the wrong because he's under no obligation to help with another man's child. The emotional aspect is tough, but he's justified in prioritizing his own well-being after the betrayal. So I think the answer is B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
