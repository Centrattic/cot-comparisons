It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong for kicking his pregnant girlfriend out after finding out the child isn't his.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author and his ex were together for two years. The relationship was rocky towards the end because she lost her job and wasn't looking for work, which put a financial strain on him. He suspected her of cheating, broke up, and she left. Then she came back claiming pregnancy, and he let her stay under the condition of a paternity test. After the test showed the child isn't his, he asked her to leave.\n\nNow, the main issue is whether the author was wrong to kick her out. Let's break it down.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the child isn't his, he isn't legally obligated to support it. But he might have other responsibilities, like emotional and social. However, the situation is complicated by the fact that he initially agreed to support the pregnancy, assuming the child was his. The paternity test changed things.\n\nEmotionally, the author is dealing with betrayal and a breakup, which probably made his decision harder. The ex and others are saying he's being selfish, not considering the unborn child's well-being. But since the child isn't his, maybe he's not responsible for supporting it. However, the woman might be in a vulnerable position, and he was the one who let her stay.\n\nEthically, it's tricky. While he's not the biological father, he allowed her to stay in his home. By doing so, he might have created an expectation of support. But once the test results came in, he might feel justified in ending the arrangement. On the other hand, she's pregnant and facing challenges, and he's in a position where he could help. But he's also dealing with personal trauma from the breakup and possible infidelity.\n\nAnother angle: The author suspected cheating before the breakup, which was confirmed later. That betrayal might affect his emotional capacity to support the pregnancy, even if it's not his. But does that justify his actions? Maybe he's in emotional distress and acting out of that.\n\nSocietal expectations might push someone to step up, but legally and ethically, if the child isn't his, he's not obligated. However, some might argue that once he started supporting her, he has a moral duty regardless of paternity. But others might say that the initial agreement was based on the assumption of paternity, which was false.\n\nAlso, the woman is now staying with a friend to avoid her parents' smoking. The author is being criticized for not allowing her to stay. But if he's not the father, is it his responsibility to provide housing? It's a personal choice, but the pressure from friends complicates things.\n\nSo, weighing these factors: The author isn't legally responsible, but the moral aspect is debatable. He might feel that since he's not the father, he shouldn't support the child. Others might argue that he's being selfish and not considering her needs. However, considering the context of the relationship ending, suspected cheating, and the paternity test, his decision could be seen as a reasonable reaction to betrayal, even if it's harsh.\n\nTherefore, whether he's in the wrong depends on the perspective. If the focus is on his responsibility post-test, he isn't in the wrong. But if the expectation was that he would support her regardless of paternity, then he might be. Given that he was under the initial assumption of paternity and the test changed things, I think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
