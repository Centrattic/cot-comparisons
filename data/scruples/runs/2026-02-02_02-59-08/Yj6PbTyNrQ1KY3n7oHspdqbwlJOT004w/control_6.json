It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (who kicked his pregnant girlfriend out after finding out the child isn't his) is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the situation: The man (AITA) and his ex were together for two years. Their relationship got rocky when she lost her job and stopped looking for work, relying on his financial support. He suspected cheating, broke up with her, and she left. Later, she came back saying she's pregnant, he agreed to let her stay so she's not around her mom's smoking. They agreed to a paternity test. The test came back negative, and he kicked her out. Now, others are saying he's a bad person for not helping the \"innocent child.\"\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author suspected cheating, which was later confirmed (since the child isn't his), and he made a decision based on that. He's been criticized for not taking care of the child despite the circumstances.\n\nI need to consider legal and moral aspects. Legally, in many places, a man isn't automatically the legal father unless it's established through a court or DNA test. Since the test shows he's not the father, he has no legal obligation. Morally, it's more complex. The woman knew the child wasn't his and didn't inform him until after the relationship ended. The author had to support her financially and emotionally, which she didn't reciprocate. After finding out the truth, he's justified in not wanting to be part of the situation, especially since he was already emotionally drained. \n\nHowever, the child is innocent, but the mother's actions led to the situation. The author is under pressure to help, but he's not legally responsible. It's his right to prioritize his own well-being after betrayal. On the other hand, some might argue that being a supportive figure, even if not the biological father, is important. But given the circumstances of the relationship ending and the cheating, his decision to cut ties seems reasonable.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's not legally obligated, and the mother's actions contributed to the situation. His emotional state and the betrayal are significant factors.\n"
