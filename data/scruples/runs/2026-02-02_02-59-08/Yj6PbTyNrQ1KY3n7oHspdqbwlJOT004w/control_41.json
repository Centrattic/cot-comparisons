It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant girlfriend after finding out the child isn't his.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The man and his ex were together for two years. The relationship was rocky because she lost her job and wasn't looking for work, relying on him financially. He suspected her of cheating and eventually broke up. She went to live with her parents. Then she comes back pregnant, and he lets her stay with the condition of a paternity test. The test proves the child isn't his, so he kicks her out. Now, friends are saying he's a bad person for not helping the child.\n\nSo the main points are: the man suspected cheating, which was later confirmed, financial strain, and the paternity issue. After the test, he no longer feels responsible and wants her out. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the child isn't his, he has no legal obligation to support it. But morally, it's more complex. The woman might be struggling, especially with her parents smoking. The man might be right to prioritize his own mental health after the betrayal and the stress. However, society often expects people to take responsibility for their actions, even if they later find out they're not the father. But in this case, the author wasn't the father, so maybe he's not obligated. Still, there's a debate about helping someone in need regardless of the circumstances. The answer depends on balancing personal responsibility versus moral obligations. Since the child isn't his, and the relationship was already broken, he's not in the wrong legally or morally. So the answer would be B.\n"
