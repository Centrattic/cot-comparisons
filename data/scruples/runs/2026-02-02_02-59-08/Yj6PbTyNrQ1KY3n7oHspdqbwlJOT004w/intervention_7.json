It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. First, I need to understand the situation clearly. The user, who we'll call the author, had a two-year relationship with his girlfriend. Things got rocky when she lost her job and stopped looking for work, relying on him financially. He suspected she was cheating, broke up with her, and she went to live with her parents. Then she came back saying she's pregnant with his child. He let her stay again, with the condition of a paternity test. The test came back negative, and he kicked her out. Now, people are saying he's a bad person for doing that, even though she cheated.\n\nSo the question is, is he in the wrong? Let's break it down. Legally, if the child isn't his, he isn't obligated to support it. But emotionally and morally, it's more complicated. He was in a situation where he believed the child was his, which might have influenced his decision to let her stay. Once the paternity test proved otherwise, his feelings changed. But does that mean he's in the wrong for not keeping her in his home after discovering the truth?\n\nHe had already broken up with her, and the pregnancy was a shock. However, the fact that she cheated is a significant factor. If the child isn't his and she was unfaithful, maybe he feels justified in not supporting the child. But others might argue that the child is innocent and shouldn't suffer because of the mother's actions. Also, the author's initial support after the pregnancy test might be seen as a commitment he's now retracting, which could be seen as unfair.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is dealing with emotional turmoil, betrayal, and the stress of an unexpected pregnancy with someone he's no longer in a relationship with. He might feel that he's being forced into a responsibility he didn't agree to once the paternity is known. The key issue here is whether the author is now responsible for supporting a child that isn't his, especially after a relationship that ended due to cheating and financial strain.\n\nLegally, since he's not the biological father, he doesn't have a duty to support the child. Morally, it's more nuanced. Some might say he's not in the wrong because he didn't cause the pregnancy and the mother's actions (cheating) were a factor. Others might argue that once he stepped in to help, he has a moral obligation to continue, regardless of the paternity test. But the author's own emotional state and the betrayal by his ex are also factors. He might feel that he can't support a child from someone who cheated on him, especially after the stress they've both been through.\n\nIn the end, the author's decision to kick her out once he found out the child wasn't his is a personal choice. Legally, he's not at fault. Morally, it's debatable. But since the question is about whether he's in the wrong, considering the context of the cheating and the paternity test, I think the answer is that he's not in the wrong. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
