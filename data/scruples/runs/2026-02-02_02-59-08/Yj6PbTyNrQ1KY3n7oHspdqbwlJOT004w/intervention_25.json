It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post (AITA stands for \"Am I the Asshole?\") is in the wrong. The situation involves the author kicking out his pregnant ex-girlfriend after finding out the child isn't his. The original poster is conflicted because friends are telling him he's a bad person for not helping her and the child.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key facts. The couple was together for two years but had a rocky end; the ex lost her job and relied on the author financially. The author suspected cheating and broke up, leading the ex to live with her parents. She then comes back pregnant, and they agree on a paternity test. The test shows the child isn't his, so he kicks her out. Now, the ex and friends are pressuring him to take her back.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. Legally, in many places, a man is not obligated to support a child if proven not his. Emotionally, the author is dealing with betrayal and emotional turmoil. The ex cheated, and the author was already in a vulnerable state. However, the author might be abandoning someone in need, but he's not legally or morally bound to provide support if he's not the father.\n\nOn the other hand, the ex is pregnant and might be in a difficult situation, but the author isn't responsible for her choices. The fact that the ex continued to live with him after the paternity test might be an issue if he wasn't aware of the child's parentage. But once the test is done, he's justified in not wanting to support someone else's child.\n\nAlso, the ex's parents smoke, which he wanted to protect the child from, but now that she's staying with a friend, maybe that's resolved. The author's emotional state is valid\u2014he's been through a lot. But is it fair to kick her out once the child isn't his? If he's not the father, then he's not obligated to provide a home. However, some might argue that he has a moral duty since the child is still in need, but that's debatable.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong because he's not the father and can't be forced to support someone else's child. His decision is based on the test result and his own emotional state. So the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
