It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Alright, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant girlfriend after finding out the child isn't his.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author and his ex had a two-year relationship. It got rocky when she lost her job and stopped looking for work, leading him to break up and she left to live with her parents. Later, she came back saying she's pregnant, and he agreed to let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. The test showed the child isn't his, so he asked her to leave. Now, friends are saying he's being a bad person for not helping the unborn child.\n\nKey points to consider: The author had already broken up with her, was in a vulnerable emotional state, and the paternity test result changed things. The woman cheated, which is a significant factor. The author's decision is influenced by betrayal, financial stress, and emotional turmoil. He's also considering the child's environment, as her parents smoke.\n\nEthical angles: The unborn child's well-being vs. the author's emotional capacity. The author isn't the biological father, so the responsibility might lie with the mother. However, in some places, laws might require support if he's the legal father, but since the test cleared him, maybe not. The author's friends argue he should help, but he's struggling with his own emotions.\n\nLegal aspects: If the author isn't the biological father, he might not have legal obligations. However, if he's listed as the father on the birth certificate, that could complicate things. The scenario doesn't mention that, so assuming he's not legally responsible.\n\nEmotional and moral responsibility: The author feels a mix of betrayal and being emotionally raw. His decision to leave is based on personal circumstances. While some might see it as heartless, others understand his need to prioritize his mental health after a painful breakup and discovery of infidelity.\n\nConclusion: The author isn't in the wrong because he had prior issues with the relationship, broke up, and the paternity test revealed he's not the father. His decision to leave is based on his own emotional state and circumstances. The responsibility for the child now falls to the biological father and the mother. So, the answer is B (No).\n"
