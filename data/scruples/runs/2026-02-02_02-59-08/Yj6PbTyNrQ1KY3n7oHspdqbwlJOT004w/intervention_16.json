It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for kicking his pregnant girlfriend out after finding out the child isn't his.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The man was in a 2-year relationship with his girlfriend. The last few months were rocky because she lost her job, wasn't looking for work, and he had to support them financially. He suspected her of cheating, broke up, and she went to live with her parents. Then, she came back saying she was pregnant, and he let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. The test showed the child wasn't his, and he kicked her out. Now, people are saying he's a bad person for not taking care of the child.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's break it down. Legally, if the man isn't the biological father, he doesn't have a legal obligation to support the child. But ethically, there might be more to consider. The woman cheated on him, which is a betrayal. After the breakup, she approached him for support. He agreed under the condition of a paternity test, which she accepted. Once the test came back negative, he ended the arrangement. \n\nHe's feeling conflicted because some people think he should still help, even though it's not his child. His reasons include emotional turmoil from the breakup, betrayal, and now not wanting to take care of someone else's child. \n\nOn one hand, he's not responsible for another man's child. On the other hand, some might argue he opened the door for support by agreeing to let her stay. But he had the condition of the test, which she agreed to. If he had known beforehand, he might not have offered the help. \n\nThe key points here are consent and conditions. He made it clear that a paternity test was necessary, and she was okay with that. So once the test results came back, he had the right to withdraw his support. However, the emotional aspect is tricky. He's under a lot of stress, and some might say he's being cold by not helping, but he's not obligated. \n\nThe woman's actions (cheating) contributed to the breakup. Now, she's in a vulnerable state, but that doesn't necessarily mean the ex is responsible. The man might feel he's not at fault here because he followed through with his conditions and then made a decision based on the outcome. \n\nBut there's also the argument that once he got involved, maybe he should have taken responsibility regardless of the test. However, legally and ethically, if the child isn't his, he's not required to support it. The woman is the mother, so she's the one responsible. \n\nIn terms of morality, it's subjective. Some might think he's being selfish, others might see him as standing his ground. The fact that he was willing to support the child before the test but changed his mind after shows he's not inherently against helping, just not in this specific case. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would depend on whether you prioritize the man's right to withdraw support once the conditions were met or the responsibility to help a vulnerable person regardless. Since the conditions were set and agreed upon, the man isn't in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
