It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for kicking out their pregnant girlfriend after discovering the child isn't theirs. \n\nFirst, let's look at the key points. The couple was together for two years, but the last months were rocky. The girlfriend lost her job and wasn't looking for work, relying on the author's financial support. The author suspected cheating and eventually broke up, leading her to live with her parents. She came back to tell him she was pregnant, and he agreed to let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. After the test confirmed the child isn't his, he kicked her out.\n\nNow, the question is whether he was wrong. Legally, he isn't obligated to support a child that's not his. The paternity test cleared that up. Emotionally, he's dealing with betrayal from the breakup and the cheating, which might have influenced his decision. However, the main issue is the unborn child's well-being. The author is not legally responsible for the child, so he's not in the wrong for refusing to take care of it. \n\nBut there's a moral angle. Even if he's not the father, the mother was staying with him before the test. The community is suggesting he take her back for the child's sake. But it's important to distinguish between legal obligations and moral choices. The author isn't required to provide a home for the child, especially after discovering the truth. His emotional state and the betrayal might justify his reaction. However, some might argue that he should still support the mother, but that's a personal choice, not a legal requirement.\n\nThe mother's actions were also questionable. She knew the child wasn't his but still came to him, possibly to get support. After the test, she's receiving criticism for his actions, but she's the one who sought his help initially. The author's decision to kick her out after the test is a result of the information he received. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong. He's within his rights to not support a child he's not the father of. The emotional turmoil doesn't make him wrong; it's a personal decision based on the circumstances. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
