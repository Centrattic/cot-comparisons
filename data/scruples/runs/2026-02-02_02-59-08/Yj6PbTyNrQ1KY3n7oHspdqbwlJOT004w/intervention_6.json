It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves him kicking his pregnant ex-girlfriend out after discovering the child isn't his.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author and his ex were together for two years. They broke up because she was living off him financially after losing her job and he suspected cheating. She then told him she's pregnant, and he let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. The test came back negative, so he asked her to leave. Now, others are telling him he's a bad person for not supporting the child.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to decide if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nSo, let's consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, in many jurisdictions, a man isn't obligated to support a child unless paternity is established. The author had the child tested, and since it's not his, he might not have legal responsibilities here. Ethically, it's more complex. The author is being pressured by friends to take care of the child, but he's not the biological father. \n\nEmotionally, the author is going through a lot. He was betrayed when she cheated, and the child not being his adds to the emotional turmoil. He's also dealing with the stress of the previous relationship issues. However, the ex is the mother, and she's the one who has a legal responsibility to care for the child. The author's responsibility is only if he's the father, which he's not.\n\nBut some might argue that he's being selfish by not helping her, even if he's not the father. However, from a rights perspective, he isn't obligated. Also, considering her parents' environment (smoking), he had a valid reason to let her stay initially. Now that the paternity is clear, he can't be forced to provide a home. \n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, the author isn't in the wrong because he isn't the father and thus not legally or ethically bound to support the child. The pressure from friends might be valid in terms of kindness, but legally and ethically, he's not obligated. However, there's a human aspect where helping someone in need could be considered, but that's more a matter of choice than obligation.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
