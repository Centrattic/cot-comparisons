It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for kicking his pregnant ex out after finding out the child isn't his. \n\nFirst, the situation: They were together for two years, had a rocky end, she lost her job, he had to support her financially. He suspected cheating, broke up, she moved out. Then she came back saying she's pregnant, he lets her stay with the condition of a paternity test. The test comes back negative, he kicks her out. Now friends and others are telling him he's wrong to not help.\n\nSo, the main points here are paternity, emotional state, and responsibility. Legally, if the child isn't his, he's not obligated to support it. But socially and morally, there's a debate. He might feel betrayed because she cheated, which is confirmed. He's going through emotional turmoil. \n\nHe allowed her to stay initially, trusting the pregnancy was his. The betrayal of the paternity test result could have triggered his decision. On the other hand, the unborn child's well-being is a consideration. He's being pressured to take care of the child, but he's not the biological father, so maybe he feels it's unfair to him to take on that responsibility.\n\nBut then, what about the mother? She cheated, but he's the one who ended up cutting her off after trusting her. Also, by letting her stay, he might have thought he was the father, and now the child is in a situation where the mother is with her parents who smoke. He didn't want the child exposed to that, but after the paternity result, maybe he felt he couldn't be the caregiver anymore.\n\nLegally, if he's not the father, he doesn't have a duty. However, if he had been acting as a parent, there could be some obligations, but the question is more about moral wrongdoing. The author might be justified in his decision because he's not the father and is dealing with betrayal. But others might argue that he should still help because the child is vulnerable.\n\nI need to consider if his actions are within his rights and moral standing. Since he's not the father, he's not legally required to support the child, and his emotional state is valid. However, kicking her out might still be seen as harsh, but maybe he's in the right if he's not responsible. The answer could be B, No, because he's not the father and has the right to his emotional well-being.\n"
