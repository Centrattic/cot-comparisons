It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant ex when the child isn't his. \n\nFirst, the timeline: They were together for two years, broke up because she was living off him, and he suspected cheating. She came back saying she was pregnant, he let her stay but with a paternity test. The test showed he's not the father, so he kicked her out. Now people are saying he's a bad person for not taking care of the unborn child.\n\nSo, the key points here. Legally, if he's not the biological father, he has no legal obligation to support the child. But there's the moral aspect. Did he have a responsibility? Well, he initially believed the child was his, which is why he agreed to let her stay. Once the paternity test proved otherwise, his obligation might end. \n\nHe's dealing with emotional trauma here\u2014cheating confirmed, financial strain, the stress of possibly being a father. His decision to ask her to leave might be about his own emotional state. But others argue he should \"suck it up\" and help regardless.\n\nBut from a legal standpoint, he's not the father, so no legal duty. Morally, it's more ambiguous. Did he have any prior commitments? He agreed to support her when he thought the child was his. Now he's done with the relationship, and the child isn't his. \n\nHe's also considering the environment. The ex's parents smoke, and he wanted to avoid that for the child. But once he's not the father, it's her responsibility to ensure a safe environment for her child. He might feel he's not responsible anymore. \n\nHe's being pressured by mutual friends and her friends to take her back. But he's emotionally raw. His well-being is also a factor here. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If he's not the father, legally no. Morally, some might argue he should still help, but others might say he's not obligated. Since the question is about being in the wrong, and legally he's not, but maybe socially there's pressure. But the answer is A or B. The question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he's not the father, it's B (not in the wrong). But wait, maybe there's a moral obligation? But the question is if he's in the wrong. If the answer is based on whether he's legally wrong, then B. If it's about moral judgment, it's more complex. The original AITA (Am I the Asshole) context usually looks for social judgment. In AITA, sometimes people are considered \"not the asshole\" even if their actions are harsh but justified. So if he's not the father, he's not responsible, so he's not the asshole. Therefore, answer B.\n"
