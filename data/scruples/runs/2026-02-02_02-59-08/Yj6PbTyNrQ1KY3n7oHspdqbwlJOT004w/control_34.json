It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant girlfriend after finding out the child isn't his. Hmm. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the author and his ex had a two-year relationship. The last few months were rough because she lost her job and he was financially supporting her. He suspected she was cheating, ended the relationship, and she moved in with her parents. Then she came back to tell him she's pregnant. He agreed to let her stay under the condition of a paternity test. They did the test, which showed the child isn't his, so he kicked her out. Now, people are saying he's a bad person for abandoning the unborn child.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the pregnancy, the paternity test, the decision to leave her after the test. The author is asking if he's in the wrong. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the child isn't his, he isn't legally obligated to support it. But morally, the question is trickier. The woman had cheated on him, which adds to his betrayal. However, the child is innocent. But wait, the child is not his. So, he's not the biological father. But maybe he had some emotional connection to the pregnancy, which was shattered when the test came back negative. \n\nThe author is struggling with his emotions\u2014feeling he's been through a lot, betrayal, and the emotional rollercoaster of the situation. He's being pressured by friends and others to take her back and help. \n\nBut here's the thing: he's not the father. He has the right to choose not to be involved financially or emotionally with a child that isn't his. Also, he's already been through a breakup and financial strain. If the woman is now staying with a friend to avoid her parents' smoking, that's her choice, but he's not responsible for her living arrangements unless there's legal obligation. \n\nHowever, some might argue that once he got involved with her and the pregnancy, even if it's not his, he might have a sense of responsibility. But legally and ethically, he's not required to support someone else's child. The fact that she cheated on him adds to his emotional distress, which makes his decision more understandable. \n\nBut the other side is that the unborn child might be in a vulnerable situation. However, the mother is now staying with a friend to avoid her parents' smoking, so maybe there are other options. The author's mental health and well-being are also important, especially after all the betrayal and emotional turmoil. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because he's not the father, and he's not obligated to support a child he isn't related to. His emotional response is valid given the circumstances. However, some might argue he should have considered the mother's situation more, but from a strict standpoint, he's not the father, so he's not in the wrong.\n"
