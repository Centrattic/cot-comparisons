It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for kicking their pregnant girlfriend out after finding out the child isn't theirs. \n\nFirst, the man and his ex had a tumultuous relationship. She lost her job, he was supporting them both, suspected her of cheating, and they broke up. She left for her parents, but later came back saying she's pregnant. He agreed she could stay, but with a paternity test. When the test shows the child isn't his, he kicks her out.\n\nNow, the key points here. The man is the one who initiated the breakup initially because of her joblessness and suspected cheating. She then comes back with the pregnancy news. He allows her to stay temporarily, but after the paternity test, he removes her. \n\nThe main question is about his responsibility towards the unborn child. The man is being criticized for not taking care of the child, especially since the mother's parents smoke. But since the child isn't his biologically, does he have any obligation? Legally, paternity is established through the test, so he's not the legal father. Ethically, though, maybe there's a debate. \n\nBut the man is in a vulnerable emotional state, dealing with betrayal from cheating and the stress of the situation. He's struggling with whether he should take responsibility despite not being the biological father. \n\nThe mutual friends are telling him to take her back and help, but he's conflicted. The user is asking if he's in the wrong. \n\nLegally, he's not the father, so he's not obligated to support the child. Emotionally, he's dealing with betrayal and a recent breakup. However, some might argue that he has a moral duty to help, especially considering her parents' smoking. But others might say that since the child isn't his, he's not responsible. \n\nThe ex is staying with a friend to avoid her parents' smoking, which is a valid concern. But the man isn't the father, so he might not be responsible for her living conditions. \n\nThe man's actions are based on the paternity test results, which confirm the child isn't his. Therefore, he's not in the wrong for not taking care of a child that isn't his, especially after a breakup where trust was broken. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). He's not obligated to care for a child he's not the father of, and his decision is based on the test results and his own emotional well-being.\n"
