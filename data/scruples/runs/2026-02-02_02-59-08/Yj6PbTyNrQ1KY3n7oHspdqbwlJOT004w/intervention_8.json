It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant girlfriend after finding out the child isn't his. The situation is complex, so I need to consider various angles.\n\nFirst, the author and his ex were in a 2-year relationship. The last few months were rocky because she lost her job, wasn't looking for work, and he had to support them financially. He suspected cheating, which led to a breakup. She then moved in with her parents. But when she found out she was pregnant, she came back to him, and he agreed to let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. She agreed, and they went through the process. The test showed the child isn't his, so he told her to leave.\n\nNow, friends and others are criticizing him for not taking care of the child. The author is conflicted, feeling emotionally raw and wondering if he's a bad person for not providing a home for the unborn child. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nLegally, since the child isn't his, he isn't obligated to support it. Paternity is crucial here. If the biological father is someone else, the responsibility lies with that person. However, social and moral expectations might differ. In some cultures or communities, there might be pressure to support the mother and child regardless of biological ties, especially if the mother was previously in a relationship with the man.\n\nEmotionally, the author was already stressed from the cheating and financial strain. The betrayal of being cheated on and then the child not being his could exacerbate his feelings. But the unborn child's well-being is a concern. If the mother is moving to stay with a friend to avoid her parents' smoking, maybe the author's home is safer. However, once he knew it wasn't his child, his responsibility changes. \n\nMoral considerations: Did he have a duty to support her regardless? Some might argue that even if the child isn't his, he's in a position to help, especially since they were in a relationship. Others might say that once paternity is proven, he's not responsible. The mother's actions, like cheating and not working, could also play into this. If she's not taking responsibility for her actions, the author might feel justified in removing himself from the situation.\n\nThe author's actions were based on the test results, which confirmed his fears. The key point is the paternity test. Legally and morally, if he isn't the father, he's not responsible for the child. However, if he had accepted the situation before the test and then changed his mind, that's different. But in this case, he set the condition of the test upfront. Once it's clear it's not his child, he's not obligated to stay involved.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of emotional commitment and potential future support. Even if not the biological father, if he had accepted the pregnancy and then pulled out, that might be seen differently. However, since the test was a condition from the start, he followed through on his terms.\n\nIn terms of societal judgment, some might see him as selfish, while others understand his position. The answer depends on whether the focus is on legal/contractual terms or social/moral expectations. Legally, he's not in the wrong. Morally, it's a gray area but since he followed through on his agreed-upon condition, he's not at fault.\n"
