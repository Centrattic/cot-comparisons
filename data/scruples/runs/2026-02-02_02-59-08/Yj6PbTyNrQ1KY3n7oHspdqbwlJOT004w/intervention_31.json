It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if the author is in the wrong for kicking out their pregnant girlfriend after finding out the child isn't theirs. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the author and the ex had a rocky relationship. The ex lost her job, wasn't looking for work, and the author had to support them both. Then the author suspected cheating, broke up, and the ex left. But then she came back pregnant, and they agreed on a paternity test. After the test showed it wasn't the author's, he kicked her out. Now people are saying he's a bad person for not helping the child.\n\nSo, the key points are: the child isn't his, he had already broken up with her before the pregnancy, he allowed her to stay temporarily but with the condition of a paternity test. Once the test came back negative, he decided to end the living arrangement. The ex and mutual friends are pressuring him to take care of the child, but he's feeling conflicted.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, since he isn't the biological father, he's not legally obligated to support the child. However, there's an emotional and social aspect here. The author might feel he's not responsible, especially since the relationship ended and he was already dealing with her joblessness and suspected infidelity. On the other hand, some might argue that even if it's not his child, he's involved in the situation and should take responsibility, especially if the ex is struggling.\n\nBut the author made it clear he wanted a paternity test before committing further. That shows he wanted to verify his responsibility. Once it was confirmed it wasn't his, he's not in a position to be forced to support someone else's child. The ex is now staying with a friend to avoid her parents' smoking, which is a health concern, but the author isn't their parent. He might feel that his own emotional state is a factor here, having gone through betrayal and stress.\n\nHowever, there's also the question of if he should have considered other options for her, like helping her find a place or support. But he's not legally bound, and he's already made a choice based on the test results. The friends' opinions might make him feel guilty, but that doesn't necessarily mean he's in the wrong. He can choose not to take financial or parental responsibility for a child that isn't his, especially after the relationship has ended.\n\nIn the end, the author isn't the parent, so his decision to end the living arrangement isn't inherently wrong. While it's a harsh decision and might be seen as heartless by some, legally and ethically, he's not wrong for not wanting to support a child that isn't his, especially given the circumstances of their broken relationship and his prior suspicions of cheating. So, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
