It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did the right thing by kicking his pregnant ex out after a paternity test showed he wasn't the father. \n\nFirst, the situation: The man and his girlfriend had a two-year relationship. The relationship was rocky before they broke up, with her losing her job and not contributing financially. He suspected cheating, which later was confirmed. She came back to live with him when she got pregnant, and they agreed to a paternity test. The test showed he wasn't the father, so he asked her to leave.\n\nNow, the question is about whether he's in the wrong. Let's consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, in many places, the biological father has certain rights, but the man here is not the biological father. So he's not legally obligated to support the child. However, there's an emotional and social component here. The woman is pregnant, and the man had initially accepted her back into his home, thinking he was the father. After the test, he changed his mind and asked her to leave. \n\nThe woman and her friends are criticizing him for not taking care of the child, implying that he should provide for her. But the man had already been through a stressful relationship, financial strain, and confirmed cheating. He might be justified in not wanting to take on the responsibility of a child that isn't his, especially given the history of her not contributing financially before. \n\nHowever, there's also the argument that the unborn child's well-being should be considered. If the woman is staying with her parents, who smoke, then maybe the man's home could be a safer environment. But he might feel that he can't handle the emotional toll, especially after the betrayal. \n\nIt's a tough call. Legally, he's not in the wrong because he isn't the father. Ethically, it's more complicated. If he had accepted the child as his own, there's an argument that he should still support the mother and child, even if he's not the biological father. But he had the paternity test done, which might have been a necessary step. \n\nThe man's decision could be seen as self-preservation after a stressful period. The woman's friends might think he should help, but he's not obligated. So, considering all angles, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong). But there's a balance between legal and ethical responsibilities here.\n"
