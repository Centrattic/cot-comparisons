It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the scenario carefully.\n\nThe author had a two-year relationship with his ex-girlfriend. The relationship was rocky in the last few months because she lost her job and wasn't looking for work, so he was financially supporting her. He suspected she was cheating, broke up with her, and she left to live with her parents. Then, a few weeks later, she came back to tell him she was pregnant. He let her stay under the condition of a paternity test. They did the test, and it turned out the child isn't his. He then told her to leave. Now, she's staying with a friend, and mutual friends are saying he's a bad person for not helping the unborn child.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, let me consider the facts. The author allowed the ex to stay in his home after the breakup because he was concerned about the environment at her parents' house. He had the right to set conditions, like the paternity test. Once the test showed the child isn't his, he decided to end the arrangement. The key points here are consent, expectations, and the legal/financial responsibilities.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if he isn't the biological father, he isn't legally obligated to support the child. However, some jurisdictions might have laws where if a man is led to believe he is the father (like if the woman told him it was his), he might have some responsibilities. But in this case, the woman didn't deceive him about the paternity until after the test. She did agree to the test, so once the result came out, he had the right to reassess his involvement.\n\nEmotionally, the author is dealing with betrayal from cheating and the stress of an unexpected pregnancy. The ex's friends are pressuring him to take responsibility, but he doesn't feel responsible for a child that isn't his. Legally, he may not have an obligation, but morally, some might argue that once he was part of the pregnancy plan, he should support the child. However, since the child isn't his, he might not feel that's fair.\n\nAnother angle is the living arrangement. He allowed her to stay for her benefit, not his own. If she's living with a friend now, maybe that's a better situation. But if the friend's environment is better than her parents', maybe that's a good outcome.\n\nPotential issues: If the author had already taken on some financial responsibilities, even temporarily, and then abandoned her, that could be seen as unfair. But he set a condition for the paternity test and followed through. Once the test showed he wasn't the father, his decision to end the arrangement seems based on the new information. \n\nHowever, some might argue that once he agreed to let her stay with the understanding that he might be the father, he has a moral obligation. But since the paternity test cleared him, it's reasonable for him to remove himself from the situation, especially given the history of cheating and financial strain.\n\nIn conclusion, legally and morally, the author isn't in the wrong because the child isn't his, he set conditions up front, and after the test results, he's not obligated to continue the arrangement. The pressure from friends might be due to misunderstanding the situation, especially if the ex is portraying the author as the father when he isn't. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
