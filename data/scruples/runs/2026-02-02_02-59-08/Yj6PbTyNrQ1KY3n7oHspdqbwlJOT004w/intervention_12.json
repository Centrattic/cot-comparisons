It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author kicking out his pregnant ex-girlfriend after a paternity test revealed the child isn't his. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author and his ex were together for two years. The relationship became rocky when she lost her job and stopped looking for work, relying on him financially. He suspected cheating and broke up with her, leading her to move in with her parents. Later, she came back to tell him she's pregnant, and he agreed to let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. After the test confirmed the child isn't his, he asked her to leave. Now, she's staying with a friend, and mutual friends are criticizing him for being cruel to the unborn child.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. The question is whether he was unfair. The options are A (yes, he's wrong) or B (no, not wrong). \n\nI should consider legal, ethical, and emotional aspects. Legally, if he isn't the father, he isn't obligated to support the child financially. However, there's a moral or social expectation sometimes to help, but that's subjective. Ethically, some might argue he's not responsible, while others might say he should help given the circumstances. Emotionally, the author is going through a lot, having been cheated on and feeling betrayed. His decision might be self-preservation after being hurt.\n\nBut the author's friends are calling him a terrible person for not helping. The ex is pregnant, and the child is vulnerable. However, the author isn't the father, so it's not his responsibility. Also, the ex was using his home to avoid her parents' smoking, which is a valid concern. But he can choose not to be involved. \n\nPotential arguments against the author: He might have a moral obligation to support the mother, even if not the father. Also, the child is dependent on her, and if she's struggling, maybe he should help. But he's already been through a lot, and the relationship was unstable. The cheating is a significant betrayal, which adds to the emotional trauma.\n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't the father, so legally and perhaps ethically, he's not responsible. He's making a choice to protect his own emotional well-being after being wronged. The friends' opinions might be influenced by social expectations rather than the facts.\n\nI think the key is whether the author is obligated to help when he's not the father. Since paternity is confirmed as not his, he's under no obligation. However, some might say he should still support because of his relationship and the mother's situation. But given that the relationship ended and there was infidelity, his choice to distance himself is understandable. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because he's not the father and has the right to prioritize his own emotional state after being betrayed. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
