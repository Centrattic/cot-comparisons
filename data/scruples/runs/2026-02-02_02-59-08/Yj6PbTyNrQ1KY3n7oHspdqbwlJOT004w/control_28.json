It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant ex-girlfriend after finding out the child isn't his. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points from the story. The author and his ex had a two-year relationship that ended because he suspected she was cheating and she was not working, relying on his financial support. After the breakup, she came back to live with him when she found out she was pregnant. He agreed on the condition of a paternity test. When the test showed he wasn't the father, he kicked her out. Now, people are criticizing him for not helping the child.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author is responsible for the child now that he's not the father. Legally, paternity is crucial for child support and custody, so if the author isn't the biological father, he's not legally obligated to support the child. However, there's a moral dimension here. Even if he's not the father, he might feel some responsibility if he was in a relationship with the mother and thought he was the father. But once the paternity is confirmed as not his, his legal obligations typically end unless he voluntarily assumed them.\n\nEmotionally, the author is going through a lot. He mentions feeling betrayed by the cheating and the stress of the situation. His decision to let her stay was under the assumption that he was the father. Once that's proven wrong, his change of heart seems justified. People are telling him to take responsibility, but he's not the biological parent. That said, if he had considered adopting the child, that could be a different scenario, but there's no mention of that here.\n\nThe ex-girlfriend's actions are also questionable. She might have known he wasn't the father when she approached him, given their recent breakup. Also, her refusal to work and financial dependency could be contributing to the tension. However, the author's response by kicking her out after the paternity test result might be seen as harsh, especially if the child is now left without support. But legally, he's not responsible. Morally, it's more complex. If he's capable and wants to help, but he's not obligated. His emotional state and the betrayal he felt are valid factors in his decision.\n\nIn summary, the author isn't legally in the wrong, and his decision to leave after finding out the child isn't his is understandable given the circumstances. However, some might argue morally he should help, but that's not his responsibility. So the answer would be B (No), he's not in the wrong.\n"
