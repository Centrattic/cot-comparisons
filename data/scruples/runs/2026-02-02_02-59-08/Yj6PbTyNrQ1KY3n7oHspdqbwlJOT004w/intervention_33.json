It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong after kicking his pregnant ex out when he found out the child isn't his. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The guy and his ex were together for two years. The relationship was already rocky because she lost her job, wasn't looking for work, and he had to support them financially. He suspected she was cheating, broke up, and she went to live with her parents. Then she came back saying she's pregnant, and he let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. She agreed, and after the test showed the child isn't his, he kicked her out. Now, people are saying he's a terrible person for not helping the unborn child and himself.\n\nSo the question is, is he in the wrong? Let's think about the key points. The guy was already in a stressful situation, the relationship had issues, and he had suspicions of cheating. Then he agreed to let her stay under the condition of a paternity test. The test proved he's not the father, which might have confirmed his suspicions about cheating. He then decided to end the arrangement, which led to her moving out.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, he's not the father, so he doesn't have a legal obligation to support the child. Emotionally and morally, though, it's more complex. He's struggling with feelings of betrayal and not wanting to be responsible for a child that isn't his, especially after a difficult breakup. However, the ex is pregnant and in a vulnerable state, and moving her into his home could provide stability for her and the child. But the guy feels he's already been through a lot and needs to prioritize his own well-being.\n\nThe ex's mom smokes, which is a health risk for the unborn child, so he was trying to help her. But after the paternity test, he's not the father, so maybe he feels he can't be responsible for the child. The friends are pressuring him to take her back, but he's conflicted.\n\nNow, considering all this, the guy's actions are based on his own emotional state and the confirmed fact that he's not the father. He had agreed to let her stay under the condition of testing, and once that was done, he followed through. However, the child is still in need, and he might be avoiding responsibility because of the betrayal. But he's not legally obligated to support the child, so maybe he's not in the wrong. But morally, some might argue he should help her regardless. \n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. If the answer is A (yes), then he's in the wrong for not supporting the child. If B (no), then he's not, as he's not the father and can't be forced to support someone else's child. The situation is nuanced, but legally and based on the terms he set, he might not be in the wrong. However, morally, it's a gray area. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide based on the facts given. I think the answer is B (No), because he's not the father and had agreed to the paternity test, so he's acting within his rights.\n"
