It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant ex-girlfriend after finding out the child isn't his. \n\nFirst, the situation: They were together for two years, broke up because she lost her job and wasn't contributing, he suspected cheating. She comes back pregnant, they agree to a paternity test. The test comes back negative, so he kicks her out. Now she's staying with a friend, but people are calling him a bad person.\n\nSo, the main points to consider here are legal, ethical, and emotional aspects. Legally, a man isn't obligated to support a child that isn't his. If the test proves he's not the father, he has no legal responsibility. However, there's the ethical angle. Even if he's not the father, the child is still a human being. But he's not the biological father, so he might not have a legal duty to provide care. \n\nBut there's the argument that he supported her financially before the test, and maybe he had some emotional investment. The question is whether he's morally obligated to help. Some people might say that he can't just abandon the child once he knows it's not his, especially since the woman might be in a vulnerable position. However, others might argue that he's not responsible since he's not the father and had been through emotional turmoil, including discovering her infidelity.\n\nThe woman cheated, which adds another layer. The betrayal might have influenced his decision. But does that justify cutting her off once the pregnancy is revealed? Also, he allowed her to stay to avoid her smoking parents, but now he's not allowing her to stay anymore. There's a shift in conditions post-paternity test. \n\nThe user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong, but the answer might depend on cultural or personal values. Legally, he's not in the wrong, but ethically, it's a gray area. The community's messages suggest they think he should help, but he's feeling conflicted. \n\nIn conclusion, while legally he's not responsible, ethically it's debatable. However, since the question is whether he's in the wrong, the answer hinges on moral responsibility. If the community believes he should help regardless of paternity, then he's in the wrong. But if the moral obligation is only to the child if he's the father, then he's not. Given the context, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he's not the father and has no legal duty. But the emotional and ethical aspects complicate it. However, based on the information given, the legal stance is clear, so the answer is B.\n"
