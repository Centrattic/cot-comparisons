It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant ex-girlfriend after finding out the child isn't his. \n\nFirst, let's recap the situation. The man and his ex were together for two years, but their relationship got rocky when she lost her job and stopped looking for work, relying on him financially. He suspected she was cheating, which led him to break up with her. She then went to live with her parents. Later, she came back saying she's pregnant and wants to stay with him because her mom smokes. He agreed but insisted on a paternity test. The test showed the child isn't his, so he told her to leave. Now, friends are criticizing him for being a bad person.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the woman cheated (confirmed by the user's suspicion), he was only supporting her because of the presumed paternity, and upon finding out it's not his child, he sent her away. Friends are pressuring him to take her in again for the child's sake.\n\nNow, considering the moral and legal aspects. Legally, the man isn't responsible for the child since it's not his. Morally, though, some might argue he should still help because the child is a victim. But others might think he's justified in not taking responsibility for someone else's child, especially after being cheated on and already in a financially strained situation.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but they're unsure. Let me think about the ethical angles. The man was in a vulnerable situation, emotionally and financially. He had every reason to believe he was the father, which influenced his decision to let her stay. Once the paternity was cleared, his responsibility to the child is not legally binding. However, the woman's situation is difficult too\u2014pregnancy, needing a stable home. But she cheated, which adds to the betrayal.\n\nAnother angle: the man is being pressured by friends to take her back. But he's also under stress and emotional turmoil. Is he morally obligated to help someone else's child? Some might say yes, out of compassion, but others would say he's not obligated. Plus, the woman's actions (cheating, not looking for work) contributed to the problems in the relationship.\n\nIn terms of fairness to the unborn child, the man's home is a better environment than her parents' house. But the man is not the father, so legally and in terms of personal responsibility, he's not required to support the child. However, if he chooses to help, that's up to him. The fact that he's being called a bad person for not doing so might be harsh, but it's a common reaction when people feel there's a duty to help.\n\nSo, considering all this, the man isn't in the wrong. He's not legally responsible, and after betrayal and a difficult breakup, it's reasonable for him to prioritize his own emotional and financial situation. While it's compassionate to help, it's not a moral obligation. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
