It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who kicked out his pregnant girlfriend after finding out the child isn't his is in the wrong. The choices are A (yes) or B (no). I need to analyze the situation carefully.\n\nFirst, the guy was in a 2-year relationship that ended because he suspected cheating and she was being a financial burden after losing her job. She left to stay with her parents. Then she came back pregnant but the child isn't his. He kicked her out. Now, people are calling him a bad person for not helping. He's conflicted.\n\nSo, the main points here: He agreed to let her stay only after arranging a paternity test. Once the test results showed he's not the father, he asked her to leave. She's now staying with a friend but others are pressuring him to take her back. He's feeling emotional turmoil but is questioning his decision.\n\nLegally, if he's not the biological father, he has no legal obligation to support the child. However, morally or socially, there might be different views. Some might argue that he should help her regardless, especially since they were in a relationship and maybe he feels responsible. Others might say that since he's not the father and the relationship was already broken, he's within his rights to not be involved further.\n\nHe also suspected she was cheating, which adds to the betrayal. The fact that she was living with her parents who smoke, and he wanted to protect the unborn child is another angle. But once the child isn't his, his responsibility shifts. \n\nHowever, the social pressure is on him. Friends are saying he's a bad person. But maybe he's justified in prioritizing his own well-being after the emotional stress. The question is whether he's in the wrong. Legally, probably not. Morally, it's subjective. If society expects him to take care of her regardless, but he's not obligated, then maybe the answer is B (No). But if he's inconsiderate or cruel, it could be A (Yes). But the situation is complex. He's going through a lot, and the child isn't his. So he's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
