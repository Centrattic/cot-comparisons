It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the guy kicked his pregnant ex out after finding out the child isn't his. They had broken up before she got pregnant, and he agreed to let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. When the test came back negative, he asked her to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the facts. The man and his ex were together for two years, but the relationship became rocky when she lost her job and wasn't looking for work. He suspected cheating, broke up with her, and she went to live with her parents. Then she came back pregnant, and he let her stay again, planning a paternity test. The test showed the child isn't his. He then kicked her out.\n\nNow, the question is whether he was wrong to do that. Let's consider both sides. On one hand, the man had already broken up with her and was financially supporting her. When he found out the child wasn't his, he might feel betrayed. He might not want to support a child that isn't his, especially if he's dealing with emotional stress. Also, he's been through the breakup, suspected cheating, and now this revelation. His emotional state is a factor here.\n\nOn the other hand, the woman is pregnant and in a vulnerable position. She's living with her parents who smoke, which is harmful to the unborn child. The man's house was supposed to be a safer environment. By kicking her out, he might be leaving her without a stable place to live, which could be dangerous for her and the baby. The friends are saying he should help regardless, arguing about the child's needs.\n\nLegally, if the man is not the biological father, he might not have a legal obligation to support the child. However, if he had accepted the child as his own before the test, there might be complications. But in this case, the man was aware of the paternity test and only agreed to help under the condition that the child was his. So once it's confirmed it's not, he may feel justified in ending the arrangement.\n\nEmotionally, he's dealing with betrayal. The ex had cheated, and now the child isn't his. It's a lot for him to process. He's in a vulnerable state himself. However, the woman is also vulnerable, and she might be in a worse position now. The man's decision affects both their lives, and the woman's well-being and the child's safety are at stake.\n\nEthically, there's a debate here. If he knew the child wasn't his, is he morally obligated to help? Some might say no, because he's not the father. Others might argue that he's still involved with the mother and has a responsibility, especially if he's been supporting her. However, he had made a condition for helping her, which was the paternity test. Once that condition was met (and the result was negative), he might feel he's fulfilled his part.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of her cheating. The man had broken up with her because he suspected cheating, which was later confirmed. That betrayal could contribute to his decision to end the relationship again. He might not want to be involved with someone who's been unfaithful and now is expecting support for a child that isn't his.\n\nHowever, the woman is now in a difficult position. She's pregnant, possibly in a harmful environment, and the man's house was a safer option. By kicking her out, he's leaving her to find another solution quickly. His friends are pressuring him to take care of them, but he's struggling with his own emotions.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the man's actions might be seen as self-preservation after a series of betrayals. But the woman's situation is dire. It's a tough balance between his right to emotional well-being and her need for support. Legally, he's not obligated, but ethically, there's a gray area. He might not be in the wrong for making a decision that's hard for him, but he's also not considering the consequences for her. However, since he didn't know the child wasn't his until the test, and he had conditions in place, his decision might be seen as within his rights.\n"
