It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant girlfriend after finding out the child isn't his. Hmm. First, I need to understand the situation properly.\n\nSo the author and his ex had been together for two years. The relationship was rocky because she lost her job and wasn't looking for work, making him support them financially. He also suspected her of cheating, which led to a breakup. Then she came back to tell him she was pregnant, and he agreed to let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. They did the test, and it turned out the child isn't his. He then asked her to leave. Now, she's with her parents but avoiding the smoke, and friends are saying he's a bad person for not helping the child.\n\nThe user's opinion is that the author is in the wrong but wants to know my take. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nLet me break this down. The key points here are the initial breakup, the pregnancy, the paternity test, and his decision to ask her to leave. Legally, if the child isn't his, he has no obligation to support it. Emotionally and morally, it's trickier. He was initially on board to support the pregnancy, but once the paternity came up negative, he changed his stance. \n\nHe mentions he suspected cheating, and the test confirmed it. So there's a betrayal aspect. But the main issue now is the unborn child. The ex is with her parents, but he's being pressured by friends to take her back. The author is conflicted between his feelings of betrayal and the responsibility towards the child.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, even if the child isn't his, there's an argument that he should help because the woman is in a vulnerable position. However, he's also dealing with emotional trauma from the cheating and financial strain. Legally, he's not responsible for the child, so he's not in the wrong there. But morally, is it fair to leave her in a situation with smokers? He let her stay initially to protect the child from that environment, then changed his mind.\n\nThe friends are saying he's a bad person for not helping, but maybe they don't realize that he's not the biological father. The author might be feeling guilt, but he's justified in protecting himself after being cheated on. However, there's also a social responsibility aspect. Even if the child isn't his, ensuring someone else is providing a safe environment could be important. The mother is with her parents, but she's avoiding them to escape the smoke. So maybe he could have helped more without taking her in again, like supporting financially if possible.\n\nBut the main question is whether he's in the wrong. If the author is not the father, he's not legally obligated. Emotionally, he's justified in not wanting to take care of a child he's not the father of, especially after betrayal. However, if he had already committed to supporting her during the pregnancy, changing his mind after the test might be seen as unfair. But he had the caveat of the paternity test. So maybe he's within his rights to back out once he knows the truth.\n\nOn the other hand, if he started providing a home and support, then abruptly leaving her in a bad situation, even if the child isn't his, could be seen as cruel. But he's not responsible for her choices. The mother is the one who needs to provide for the child, regardless of the father's identity. If she's not able to, maybe it's a system issue, but the author isn't the solution here.\n\nSo weighing it all, I think the author is not in the wrong because he's not the father, and after the betrayal, he's protecting himself. However, there's a gray area in terms of social responsibility. But given the circumstances, the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong).\n"
