It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant girlfriend after finding out the child isn't his. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author and his ex had a two-year relationship that ended because she lost her job and wasn't looking for work, and he suspected her of cheating. He broke up with her, and she left. Then she came back to tell him she was pregnant, and he agreed to let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. After the test confirmed the child isn't his, he kicked her out. Now, people are saying he's a bad person for not helping her and the child.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the paternity test result and the author's decision. Legally, if the child isn't his, he's not obligated to support them. But maybe there's a moral aspect here. Did he have any responsibility towards her even if he's not the father? Well, she was cheating, so he has no obligation. However, she's pregnant, and she's in a difficult situation with her parents smoking. He provided a home initially but once the paternity test came back negative, he felt justified in ending the arrangement.\n\nBut wait, does the fact that he agreed to let her stay after the pregnancy mean he had some responsibility? Or is it just a personal choice? He set the condition of the paternity test, so he was clear about his terms. Once those terms were met (test done, result known), he followed through on his condition. \n\nNow, others are criticizing him, but maybe they don't consider the emotional and financial strain. The author was already stressed from the breakup, cheating, and financial support. He might feel that he's not responsible for a child that's not his, especially given the circumstances. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that once he got involved with her and allowed her to live with him, he took on some responsibility, but legally, without being the father, he's not bound. The ex is now in a vulnerable state, and he's choosing not to help. But is that his obligation? It's a moral question. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because he wasn't the father and had conditions set. He's not obligated to support someone else's child. The emotional aspect is tough, but he's entitled to his feelings, especially after the betrayal. So the answer would be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
