It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant girlfriend after finding out the child isn't his.\n\nFirst, the timeline: They were together for two years, broke up when she lost her job and wasn't contributing. He suspected cheating, and she left. Then she came back saying she's pregnant, and he agreed to let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. After the test, he kicks her out because the child isn't his.\n\nHe's now being accused of being a bad person for not helping the unborn child. The main points here are consent to stay under the condition of the paternity test, the result, and his subsequent decision to leave her.\n\nLegally, if there's no legal father status established, he might not have obligations. But ethically, it's more complex. He trusted her during the pregnancy, and the betrayal from cheating and the child not being his adds to his emotional turmoil. However, the unborn child's well-being is a factor too. But since the child isn't his, his responsibility isn't legal. Still, some might argue he has a moral duty to support the mother and child, especially if he's in a position to help.\n\nMutual friends and her friends are pressuring him, which is common in such cases. The author is torn between his emotional state and societal expectations. His decision to leave her might be seen as self-preservation after betrayal, but others might see it as abandonment.\n\nThe key here is whether the author is in the wrong. If he had no legal obligation and the arrangement was based on the child being his, then his decision to leave upon discovering the truth could be seen as reasonable. However, if he had a moral duty to support the mother regardless, then he might be at fault. But since he had already broken up with her and the pregnancy was a new factor, his actions are more about protecting himself from further betrayal and financial responsibility for a child he didn't father.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer would likely be B (No), as he's not legally bound and acted based on the condition he set. But ethical opinions might vary.\n"
