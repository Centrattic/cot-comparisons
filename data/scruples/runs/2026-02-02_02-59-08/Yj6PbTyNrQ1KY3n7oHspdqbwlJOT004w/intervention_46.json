It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if the author is in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant girlfriend after finding out the child isn't his. \n\nFirst, the situation: They were together for two years, had a rocky breakup because she lost her job and wasn't looking for work, and he suspected cheating. She left to live with her parents. Then she came back saying she was pregnant, and he agreed to let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. After the test showed the child isn't his, he made her leave. Now, people are saying he's a bad person for not helping her and the child.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author is wrong for doing this. Let's consider the key points. The author agreed to let her stay under the condition of a paternity test. Once he found out the child isn't his, he felt betrayed and asked her to leave. He's dealing with emotional turmoil from the breakup, cheating suspicions, financial responsibilities, and now this.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the author isn't the biological father, so he doesn't have a legal obligation to support the child. However, morally, some might argue that once he committed to helping her after the paternity test, he should follow through. But others might say he had the right to back out once he knew the child wasn't his, especially after discovering she cheated. \n\nEmotionally, he's been through a lot. The ex cheated, lied about the paternity, and the author is now dealing with the aftermath. It's understandable that he wants space to heal. The ex is now staying with friends, so she's not entirely without support. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of the unborn child. Even if the author isn't the father, the child might still need support. However, the author hasn't shown any intention to take responsibility beyond the initial offer, which he rescinded upon knowing the truth. \n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's not the father and the pregnancy was based on a lie (cheating), then some might say he's justified in cutting ties. Others might argue that once he committed to help, he should honor that commitment regardless of the paternity result. \n\nBut since the paternity test was part of the agreement, and he went through with it, the decision to leave after the result was negative seems more about betrayal rather than the child itself. The author might feel wronged because the relationship was based on a lie. However, the child is innocent, so some might say he should still help. \n\nIn conclusion, the answer hinges on whether the author is morally obligated to help even though he's not the father. Legally, he doesn't have to, but morally, it's a gray area. Given the betrayal and his emotional state, some might argue he's justified. But others would say he's in the wrong for not supporting a pregnant woman and child. The answer is subjective, but based on the given options, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. However, I need to decide between A and B.\n"
