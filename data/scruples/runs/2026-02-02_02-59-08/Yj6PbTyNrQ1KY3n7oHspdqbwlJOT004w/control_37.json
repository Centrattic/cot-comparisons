It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author found out the child his ex-girlfriend is pregnant with isn't his. He kicked her out of his house. Now, people are saying he's a bad person for not helping the unborn child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, the author isn't the father if the paternity test confirms it. So he doesn't have a legal obligation to support the child. But ethically, people might argue that he should help because the child is vulnerable. However, the author was already in a difficult situation with the ex cheating and financial strain. \n\nThe ex was living with him, causing financial issues, and he ended the relationship. Then she came back expecting him to support a child that isn't his. The author had the caveat of a paternity test, which she agreed to. Once it was clear he wasn't the father, he decided to end the living arrangement. \n\nEmotionally, he's been through a lot, and the betrayal from cheating might have contributed to his decision. But the key point is that once it was confirmed he's not the father, he's not legally responsible. However, some might say that once he found out about the pregnancy, he should have stepped up regardless, but since it's not his child, that's not required. \n\nThere's also the aspect of the child's well-being. The ex wanted to stay with him to avoid the smoky environment, but he has a right to his own space and not be forced into a situation. The author's decision to stop supporting the pregnancy after finding out isn't his responsibility. \n\nBut others might argue that even if it's not his child, he should help because it's an innocent child. However, the author had already agreed to let her stay under the condition of a paternity test. Once the test showed it's not his, he's within his rights to ask her to leave. \n\nThe emotional turmoil and betrayal from cheating also play a role. The author might feel he's been wronged, and the child's presence could be a constant reminder. So, while some might empathize with the child's situation, the author isn't legally or ethically required to take responsibility. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, he's not in the wrong) because once paternity is denied, he's not obligated to support the child. His decision to ask her to leave after the test is his right, considering the circumstances and his own well-being.\n"
