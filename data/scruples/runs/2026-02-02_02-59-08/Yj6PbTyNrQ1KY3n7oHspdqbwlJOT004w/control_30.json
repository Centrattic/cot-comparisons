It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant girlfriend after finding out the child isn't his. Hmm. First, I need to look at the key points here.\n\nThe couple had been together for two years, but their relationship was rocky. The girlfriend lost her job and wasn't looking for work, relying on the author financially. The author suspected she was cheating and eventually broke up, leading her to live with her parents. Then she came back, pregnant, and he let her stay on the condition of a paternity test. The test showed the child isn't his, so he asked her to leave.\n\nNow, the author is being criticized by others for not supporting the child. The question is whether he's in the wrong. Let me consider the ethical aspects. Legally, if the child isn't his, he has no legal obligation. However, morally, some might say that once he was involved in the situation, he's now responsible. But others might argue that he had good reason to believe it was his child, and when proven otherwise, he's not obligated to continue support. \n\nThe author's reasoning: he had a breakdown in trust due to cheating, financial strain, and now the betrayal of the child not being his. He's emotionally overwhelmed. The girlfriend's family has issues, so he allowed her to stay, but now that it's not his child, he can't deal with it. \n\nBut then again, the child is innocent. If the author is the father, he would be responsible. Even if he's not, the woman is pregnant and in a vulnerable state. However, the author isn't the father, so his responsibility is different. \n\nI need to think about societal expectations. Some might say he's a jerk for abandoning the woman now, especially if she's in a bad situation. Others might side with him because he was used and the child isn't his. The key here is that he followed through with the paternity test and acted based on the results. He had a condition for her staying, and she agreed to it. \n\nBut then, does agreeing to the test mean he's okay with leaving her in a difficult spot if it's not his? Maybe not. However, he's not legally bound to help. The moral obligation is debatable. If he's emotionally unable to support her, maybe that's understandable. \n\nI think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because he had a prior agreement for the test, and upon the results, he acted on his own terms. However, some might argue that he's still responsible for her well-being. But legally and ethically, if the child isn't his, he's not obligated. So the answer is B.\n"
