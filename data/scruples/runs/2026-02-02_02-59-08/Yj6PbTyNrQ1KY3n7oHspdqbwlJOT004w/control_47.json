It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The question is whether the person who wrote this (the author) is in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant ex after a paternity test revealed the child isn't his.\n\nFirst, the situation: They were in a 2-year relationship, which ended when he broke up with her. She then got pregnant and asked to stay with him under the condition of a paternity test. The test showed the child isn't his, so he asked her to leave. Now, people are saying he's being unfair to the unborn child.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author is obligated to support a child that isn't biologically his, especially after the relationship ended and there was infidelity involved. Legally, paternity can be contested. If the test proves he's not the father, he doesn't have a legal obligation to support the child. That seems to be in his favor.\n\nEmotionally and ethically, it's more complex. He might feel a moral obligation if he was led to believe the child was his, but once the test proves otherwise, that obligation might be lifted. He also mentions the cheating, which adds to the betrayal. However, the ex is now a single parent, and the child is vulnerable. The author might be seen as abandoning them, even if not legally responsible. But on the other hand, he's not the father, and the relationship was already over.\n\nThe author is being criticized for not taking responsibility, but if there's no legal or biological tie, is he in the wrong? It's a tough call. The key points are the paternity test results and the legal implications. If he's not the father, then he's not obligated, so maybe he's not in the wrong. But from a compassionate standpoint, some might argue he should help regardless. However, the question is about being in the wrong, which usually relates to legal or moral wrongdoing. Since he's not the father, legally he's not in the wrong. Morally, it's debatable, but the answer might be B (No).\n"
