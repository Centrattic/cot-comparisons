It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant ex-girlfriend after finding out the child isn't his. The situation is a bit complicated.\n\nFirst, they were together for two years but had a rocky time. She lost her job and wasn't looking for work, so he was financially supporting them. He suspected cheating, broke up, and she left. Then she came back saying she was pregnant, and he agreed to let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. After the test showed it wasn't his, he had her leave.\n\nThe main issue here is whether he was wrong to do that. The user wants a yes or no answer based on the scenario. \n\nLegally, if the child isn't his, he doesn't have a legal obligation to support it. But ethically, there's a debate. Some might say he's not responsible because it's not his child, especially given the circumstances of the relationship ending due to cheating. Others might argue that he's still part of her life and should help, even if the child isn't his.\n\nHe also mentions feeling emotionally raw and conflicted. His ex and friends are pressuring him to take care of the child. But he's questioning if he was wrong. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, if he was aware the child wasn't his, he's not obligated. The fact that he suspected cheating and the relationship was already over adds context. However, some might argue that once you're involved in someone's life, you have a responsibility to help, regardless of paternity. \n\nBut the key points are: the paternity test confirmed it's not his, he had the condition for the test upfront, and he's not legally bound. So from a legal and some ethical standpoints, he's not in the wrong. However, others might still see him as selfish for not helping. \n\nThe answer would likely be B (No), because the author isn't in the wrong since the child isn't his and the circumstances of the relationship ending with cheating play a role. Also, he had conditions set before allowing her to stay. The decision to leave was based on the test result, which he agreed to beforehand.\n"
