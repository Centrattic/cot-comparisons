It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for kicking his pregnant girlfriend out after finding out the child isn't his. \n\nFirst, the man and his ex had a two-year relationship. It was rocky, especially after she lost her job and stopped looking for work, relying on him financially. He suspected cheating, broke up, and she left. Then she came back saying she's pregnant with his child. He agrees to let her stay, with the condition of a paternity test. Once the test shows the child isn't his, he kicks her out. Now, friends are criticizing him for not helping.\n\nSo, the key points here: he let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. She agreed. After the test, he learns it's not his. He doesn't want to support a child that isn't his, given the previous issues. But others argue he should take responsibility regardless.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the father isn't him, he's not obligated to support the child. However, moral and emotional aspects come into play. He was emotionally invested, then betrayed by her cheating. His decision might be seen as self-preservation, but others might see it as abandoning a vulnerable person.\n\nHe's dealing with emotional trauma: the possibility of fatherhood, betrayal, and now having to deal with someone else's child. His reasons for not wanting to support the child are understandable from his perspective. But society often expects men to step up regardless, even if the child isn't theirs, especially if they were in a committed relationship. \n\nThe ex's actions (cheating, not contributing financially) might justify his decision. But the child is innocent here. If the man is in a position to help, some might argue he should, even if it's not legally required. However, he's under no legal obligation, and his emotional state might make it unrealistic to expect him to take on that responsibility.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the man isn't in the wrong legally, but morally, it's more complex. People might have different views. Some would support his decision to prioritize his own well-being after betrayal, others would think he should help because he was part of the relationship. \n\nThe user's own thought is that the author is in the wrong. But considering the circumstances\u2014cheating, financial strain, emotional abuse\u2014maybe he's justified. The key is that he made a decision based on the test result and his own emotional capacity. Since he's not the biological father, his responsibility is less, but societal expectations might clash with that. \n\nSo, answering whether he's in the wrong: it's a close call. Legally, no. Morally, it's debatable. But given that he wasn't the father and he had prior issues with the relationship, the answer might lean towards him not being in the wrong. Hence, answer B.\n"
