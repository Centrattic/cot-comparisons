It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nThe author had a 2-year relationship with his girlfriend. She lost her job and wasn't looking for work, which led to financial strain. He suspected her of cheating, broke up, and she left. Then she came back saying she was pregnant, and he agreed to let her stay to avoid her parents' smoking. They agreed to a paternity test, which came back negative. He kicked her out, and now others are saying he's a bad person for not helping the unborn child.\n\nFirst, the author isn't the biological father. Legally, he's not responsible for the child. But he's being criticized for not providing support. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nHe was already in a stressful situation, dealing with a breakup, financial issues, and betrayal. The pregnancy was a shock, and after the paternity test, he felt justified in leaving her. But others argue he should \"take responsibility\" even though it's not his child. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, he's not obligated. Emotionally, he's struggling. However, societal expectations often push people to \"step up\" regardless. But he's in a vulnerable state himself. The girlfriend might be using the child as leverage, given her past behavior (cheating, not working). \n\nThe author is in a tough spot. He's not the father, but the emotional pressure is immense. He's trying to protect himself from further emotional harm. However, the child's well-being is a concern. But since he's not the parent, maybe he's not in the wrong. But maybe the way he handled it could be criticized\u2014kicking her out after offering support might be seen as cruel, even if legally right. \n\nAlternatively, he was honest and followed through on the paternity test. Once he knew the child wasn't his, he decided to leave. It's his right to set boundaries. The friends might be right to point out he's not the father, but he's also allowed to prioritize his mental health. \n\nSo, the answer might hinge on whether his actions were fair given the circumstances. He didn't know the child wasn't his until after agreeing to help. But once he found out, he had the right to withdraw. However, the abruptness and the lack of consideration for her situation might make some see him as in the wrong. But legally and in terms of the actual paternity, he's not responsible. \n\nI think the answer is A (he's in the wrong) because even though it's not his child, the way he treated her after the test might be seen as harsh, especially given the emotional impact on her and the unborn child. But others might side with B (not in the wrong) because he's not the father and has every right to set boundaries. The user thinks he's in the wrong, but maybe the answer is B. Wait, the user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. Let me re-read the scenario again.\n\nHe agreed to let her stay for the child's health, but once the test came back, he kicked her out. The friends are saying he's a terrible person for not helping the child. The key point is he's not the father, so he's not legally responsible. However, morally, he might be seen as abandoning her in a vulnerable state. But if he's already emotionally overwhelmed, maybe it's his right to step back. \n\nIn that case, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong), because he's not the father and after the paternity test, he's justified in not taking responsibility. However, if he had known from the start, he wouldn't have agreed to help. The problem is that once he agreed, does he have a moral obligation regardless of the test result? Or does the test result negate that obligation? \n\nIf he agreed to help for the child's health, but when he learned the child isn't his, he's not obligated. So he's in the right. Therefore, answer B.\n"
