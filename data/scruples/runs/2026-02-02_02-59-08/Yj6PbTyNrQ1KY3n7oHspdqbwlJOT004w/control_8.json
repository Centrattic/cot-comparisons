It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole?) scenario is in the wrong for kicking his pregnant girlfriend out after finding out the child isn't his.\n\nFirst, the situation: The ex-girlfriend and the author were together for two years. The relationship became strained when she lost her job and stopped looking for work, relying on him financially. He suspected she was cheating. They broke up, and she left. Then she came back, pregnant, and he agreed to let her stay until a paternity test confirmed the child wasn't his. He then asked her to leave. Now, others are criticizing him for not supporting her and the child despite the circumstances.\n\nThe key points here involve responsibility and ethics. If the child isn't his, does he have an obligation to help? Legally, if he's not the biological father, he might not have legal obligations. However, ethically, if he believed the child was his and has been acting as a father, that could complicate things. But since the test proved otherwise, he's within his rights to step back.\n\nHe had conditions from the start\u2014paternity test. She agreed. Once the test came back negative, his decision to end the arrangement makes sense. The fact that he initially took her in out of good faith but followed through on his condition shows some responsibility. However, the emotional aspect is tricky. Even if the child isn't his, the mother's well-being and the child's needs matter. But the author is overwhelmed and feels betrayed. He's also dealing with her cheating, which adds to his emotional state.\n\nBut does that justify not helping? If she's in a harmful environment (her parents smoke), he might have a moral duty to provide a safe space regardless of the paternity. However, he's not obligated to be a father if the child isn't his. The mutual friends and her friends arguing he should help might be pushing for a moral stance beyond legal obligations.\n\nOn one hand, he's not in the wrong legally. On the other hand, if he's been acting as a father and then abruptly leaving her in a difficult situation, that could be seen as neglecting his moral responsibility. The question is whether he's being fair to the child and the mother. If he's not the father, he's not responsible for the child's care. But if he's been helping, maybe he should continue to support the mother in some way, even if not as a parent.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that he's emotionally raw and doesn't want to take care of the child. That's understandable, but the question is about fairness. If the child isn't his, then he's not in the wrong for not taking responsibility. However, if he's been providing support and now is cutting off abruptly without considering her safety, that could be seen as harsh. However, given that she's now staying with a friend to avoid the smoke, maybe there's an alternative.\n\nIn summary, legally and based on the conditions set, he's not in the wrong. Ethically, it's a bit more nuanced, but since he's not the father and the test was done per his agreement, he's not obligated. The answer would likely be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
