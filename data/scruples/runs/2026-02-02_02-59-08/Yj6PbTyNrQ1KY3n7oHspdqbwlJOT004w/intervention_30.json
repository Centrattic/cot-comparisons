It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a man who kicked out his pregnant ex-girlfriend after finding out the child isn't his. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the facts. The couple had a rocky relationship, the man broke up with her, but let her stay after she told him she was pregnant. They agreed to a paternity test, which came back negative. The man then asked her to leave. His ex and friends are criticizing him for not helping.\n\nSo, the main points are: the man isn't the biological father, but he initially took her in because of the pregnancy. Now that the paternity is confirmed negative, he's choosing not to support her. The ex and friends argue he should still help because the child is vulnerable. But the man feels emotionally raw and betrayed, especially since she cheated.\n\nLegally, if the man isn't the biological father, he doesn't have legal obligations towards the child. However, if he had previously accepted the role of a father (like providing support or making decisions), there might be legal implications. But in this case, after the paternity test, he's disengaging. \n\nEthically, it's more complex. Even if he's not the biological father, he might be seen as abandoning a woman in need, especially if they were in a committed relationship. But he could argue that he was mislead and wants to protect himself from further emotional and financial strain. \n\nThe woman cheated, which adds to the betrayal. The man's decision could be seen as self-preservation. However, the child's well-being is a consideration. If the woman is staying with a friend and her parents are problematic (smoking, etc.), is the man's refusal to help putting the child in a risky situation? \n\nBut from a legal standpoint, unless he legally acknowledged paternity, he isn't responsible. The friends' arguments about helping might be more about social expectations than legal obligations. The man is within his rights to refuse support but may face social judgment. \n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. Legally, probably not. Morally, it's debatable. Some might say he's justified given the betrayal and the fact it's not his child. Others might think he should still help because the woman was in his life and the child is innocent. \n\nBut the user thinks he's in the wrong. I need to decide based on the scenario. The man didn't know the child wasn't his and took her in with the caveat of a test. After the test, he's not obligated to support. So in terms of fairness, he's not in the wrong if we consider his rights and the legal aspect. The emotional and moral arguments are on both sides, but the question is about being in the wrong. \n\nThe answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's not the biological father and has no legal obligation. But the moral aspect is tricky. However, the question is about being in the wrong, which could be judged by both legal and ethical standards. Since legally he's not obligated, and ethically, while others may criticize, he's not necessarily in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
