It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for kicking his pregnant girlfriend out after a paternity test showed the child isn't his. Hmm. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation fully. The man and his ex had a two-year relationship. It got rocky when she lost her job and stopped looking for work, leading him to break up with her. She then came back pregnant, he let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. The test came back negative, so he asked her to leave. Now, others are telling him he's being a bad person.\n\nSo, the key points here are: he's not the biological father, he's dealing with emotional trauma from the breakup and possible cheating. He's under pressure to take care of the child. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if he's not the biological father, he might not have any legal obligation to support the child. But legally, he might still have some responsibilities if he publicly acknowledged the child as his own before the test. However, the question is more about moral or ethical wrongs, not legal.\n\nEthically, this is tricky. He was already in a stressful situation, had broken up with her, and then found out he's not the father. His emotional state is raw. Arguably, he's not in the wrong for choosing his own well-being. But others might say that once he knew about the pregnancy, he had a responsibility to support the child, regardless of paternity.\n\nBut wait, the paternity test was done under mutual agreement. They both agreed to the test, and the woman was happy to do it. Once the results came back, he had the right to decide his involvement. He's not the father, so maybe he's not obligated. The pressure from friends might be clouding his judgment, but he's dealing with betrayal and stress. \n\nHowever, the woman is now in a situation where she's pregnant, possibly vulnerable, and he's asking if he's in the wrong for not supporting her. But he's not her family, they broke up, and he's not the father. It's his right to choose not to be involved, especially after the circumstances. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that once you're in a relationship and someone gets pregnant, even if you break up, there's a moral responsibility. But since the child isn't his, that argument weakens. The key here is mutual agreement on the paternity test. Both parties were aware of the possibility and went through it. The result changed the dynamics, so he's not in the wrong for making that decision.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is probably B (not in the wrong). He's not the father, he made a mutual agreement to test, and after the results, he's within his rights to not support the child. The emotional pressure from friends is valid, but he's also allowed to prioritize his own mental health, especially after the relationship's breakdown and possible cheating.\n"
