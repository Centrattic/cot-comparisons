It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for kicking his pregnant girlfriend out after finding out the child isn't his.\n\nFirst, the situation: They were together for two years. The relationship became rocky when she lost her job and stopped looking for work, leading him to break up and her leaving. She came back pregnant, and he let her stay under the condition of a paternity test. After the test showed he's not the father, he asked her to leave. Now, friends are accusing him of being a bad person for not helping the unborn child.\n\nKey points to consider: The author had a prior arrangement to test paternity. Once the test showed he's not the father, he felt justified in ending the living arrangement. He's been accused of being selfish or cruel for not providing support regardless of paternity.\n\nLegal perspective: Parental responsibility laws vary, but typically, legal obligation to support a child is based on being the biological parent or having committed to support them. Since the author isn't the biological father and never legally committed to support the child, he might not have a legal duty. However, societal and moral expectations might differ.\n\nEmotional factors: The author is dealing with betrayal and emotional turmoil. The ex cheated, leading to the breakup. The author might feel justified in walking away after being deceived. However, the child is innocent, so there's a moral argument that the author should still support the mother and child, regardless of the relationship issues.\n\nEthical considerations: Even if not legally responsible, some might argue that the author has a moral obligation to help, especially since he allowed her to live with him. Others might say he's not obligated to support a child he's not the father of, especially after the relationship ended on bad terms.\n\nSocial pressure: Friends are telling him he's wrong, but that doesn't necessarily mean he is. The situation is complex, and his actions are influenced by personal feelings and trust issues.\n\nConclusion: The author's decision is understandable given the circumstances\u2014discovering the child isn't his after a breakup and suspicions of cheating. Legally and morally, he isn't necessarily in the wrong, though there's a debate about his responsibility. However, the answer hinges on whether the author's decision is fair. Since he agreed to the paternity test and followed through, and given the betrayal, he's not in the wrong. So the answer would be B.\n"
