It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he kicked his pregnant ex out after finding out the child isn't his. They were together for two years, broke up, then she came back saying she's pregnant. He agreed to let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. Once the test showed the child isn't his, he made her leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal angle. If he's not the biological father, he isn't legally obligated to support the child. But maybe there were other agreements or expectations? Also, he was financially supporting her before, but after the breakup, he had to support both. That might have been a point of tension.\n\nEmotionally, he's dealing with betrayal from cheating and the stress of the pregnancy. He might feel relieved or angry upon finding out the child isn't his. But the ex and friends are saying he's being a bad person by not helping. They might argue that he has a moral responsibility, even if not genetic, since he was involved in the pregnancy and initial support.\n\nOn the other hand, he's feeling emotionally overwhelmed. He's been through a breakup, possible cheating, financial strain, and now the shock of the paternity test. He might be justified in needing space to process and not want to take on more responsibility, especially if it's not his child.\n\nBut what about the child's well-being? If the ex is staying with friends to avoid her parents' smoking, maybe the author's home is a better environment. However, he's not the parent, so maybe he's not responsible. But he did agree to let her stay again, so there might be an expectation of support.\n\nMoral responsibility is tricky here. Even if not the father, he was in a relationship and might feel responsible. But he has the right to his emotional well-being. The friends might be pressuring him to be a caretaker, but that's not necessarily his duty if he's not the parent.\n\nLegally, he's not the father, so he's not obligated. The ex is the parent, and it's her responsibility to care for the child. The author might be in the right to walk away, especially after the betrayal and confirmed cheating. However, some might argue he should still help given their past relationship.\n\nIn summary, the author's actions could be seen as self-preservation given the circumstances, but others might argue he has a moral obligation. Since the question is about being in the wrong, if we focus on legal and emotional aspects, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But if considering moral responsibility for past support, some might say A. But the key points are the paternity test result and his lack of legal obligation, so probably B.\n"
