It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant ex after a paternity test showed the child isn't his.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author and his ex had a two-year relationship that ended because she lost her job and wasn't contributing, leading him to break up. She came back when she found out she was pregnant, and he let her stay under the condition of getting a paternity test. When the test showed the child wasn't his, he kicked her out. Now she and others are saying he's a bad person for not helping.\n\nSo, the key points here: The author initially supported her because he thought the child was his, but once he found out it wasn't, he changed his mind. He's being criticized for not continuing to help despite the child not being his.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, I think he has no obligation to support someone else's child unless he's legally the father. Since the test proved he's not the father, he's not responsible financially. Emotionally, he's dealing with betrayal and the stress of the situation. He had already broken up with her before the pregnancy, so maybe taking her back was a mistake even if the child was his. But now that he's found out it's not his, he feels justified in leaving. \n\nBut others argue he should help because the child is in a vulnerable situation. However, he's not the legal father, so he's not bound by law. Morally, some might say he should still help, but others might say he's not obligated. The ex cheated on him, which adds to the betrayal. The author is also in a vulnerable emotional state, which affects his decisions.\n\nI need to consider if he had any prior agreements or if he's legally bound. Since the paternity test cleared him, he's off the hook. So, legally, he's not in the wrong. Morally, people might have different opinions, but the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" which usually relates to legal or moral responsibility. Since he's not the father, he can't be held legally responsible. Morally, it's debatable, but the question is whether he's in the wrong. Given that, I think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's not legally or morally obligated to support someone else's child, especially after discovering the truth through the test he agreed to.\n"
