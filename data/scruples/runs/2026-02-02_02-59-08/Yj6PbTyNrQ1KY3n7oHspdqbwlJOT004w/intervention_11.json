It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if the author is in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant ex after finding out the kid isn't his. Let me break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, they were in a two-year relationship. The ex lost her job and stopped looking for work, relying on the author for financial support. He broke up with her, and she left. Then she came back saying she's pregnant. He agreed to let her stay to avoid the baby being around her parents' smoking. He made a paternity test condition, which she agreed to. The test came back negative, and he kicked her out. Now she and others are saying he's being a bad person by not taking care of the child.\n\nThe author's reasons are that the child isn't his, he's emotionally raw from the breakup and cheating (which was confirmed later), and he feels he can't handle the situation. The main question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nLegally, if the child isn't his, he doesn't have a legal obligation to support it. However, morally, some might argue he should help because he was involved in the relationship and the pregnancy was presented as his. But others might say he's not responsible if it's proven not his. Emotionally, he's been through a lot\u2014cheating, financial strain, breakup. But the ex might have known the child wasn't his when she told him she was pregnant, which could be deceptive.\n\nThe author's actions could be seen as self-preservation, especially after betrayal. However, the child's well-being is a concern. Maybe he could have found another way to help without keeping her in his house. But since the child isn't his, forcing him to take care of it might not be fair. The ex's friends and mutual friends are pressuring him, but their opinions might not consider his emotional state or the deceit.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author might feel wronged due to the cheating and not being the father. But the child is innocent. If he's capable, maybe he should help. However, he's not legally obligated. The key points are the deception (if she knew the child wasn't his and led him on) and his emotional capacity. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because the child isn't his, and he had the right to make that decision after the paternity test. However, there's a moral gray area. But since the question is about being in the wrong, and legally/morally he's not responsible, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But if the ex was deceptive, maybe he's justified. But if he was emotionally manipulating the situation, maybe not. It's a bit of a tough call, but based on the info given, the answer leans towards B.\n"
