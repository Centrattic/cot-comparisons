It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post (AITA) is in the wrong. The situation involves the author kicking out his pregnant girlfriend after finding out the child isn't his. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The ex and author were together for two years, but the relationship was rocky. She lost her job, wasn't looking for work, and was living off him. He suspected cheating and broke up with her. Later, she came back saying she's pregnant, and he agreed to let her stay on the condition of a paternity test. When the test showed the child isn't his, he kicked her out.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author had agreed to the paternity test, which both parties consented to. Once the test confirmed he wasn't the father, he felt justified in ending the arrangement. But others are criticizing him for not helping the unborn child. \n\nI need to consider legal and ethical angles. Legally, in many places, a man isn't automatically responsible for a child unless paternity is established. So he might not have a legal obligation here. Ethically, it's a bit more complex. While he isn't the father, some might argue that he has a moral responsibility since he was in a relationship with the mother and perhaps contributed to the situation. However, others might say that once paternity is ruled out, he has no obligation.\n\nThe author's emotional state is also a factor. He mentions feeling betrayed and emotionally raw. It's possible that the decision to let her stay was based on a false premise (assuming he was the father), so when that's proven wrong, he's no longer willing to support her. \n\nAnother angle is the well-being of the unborn child. Critics might say that the child's needs should take precedence, but the author isn't the legal guardian. The mother is responsible for the child's care, and he might not have a duty to provide housing unless he's the father or has a legal agreement. \n\nHowever, there's a social expectation sometimes that people in such situations might be expected to help, even if they aren't the father. But that's not legally binding. The author's right to his living space and his mental health could also be considered. He's been through a lot, and the betrayal might have justified his reaction.\n\nI should also think about the possibility of the mother's actions. She was cheating and not working, contributing to the breakdown of the relationship. If she knew the child wasn't his, maybe she had a reason to keep him in the dark. That adds a layer of deceit, which might make the author's actions more understandable.\n\nOn the other hand, kicking someone out while they're pregnant could be seen as harsh, even if there's no legal obligation. But the author isn't the father, so perhaps it's a matter of personal responsibility versus societal judgment.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be in the wrong because he's not the father, and the agreement was based on paternity testing. However, some might argue he's abandoning a vulnerable person. But legally and based on the agreement, he's within his rights. So the answer is B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
