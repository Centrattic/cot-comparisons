It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did the wrong thing by kicking out his pregnant girlfriend after finding out the child isn't his. \n\nFirst, the key points from the story: The ex and author were in a two-year relationship. The relationship became rocky as she lost her job and didn't look for work, relying on him financially. He suspected cheating and eventually broke up, leading her to move in with her parents. She came back pregnant, and he let her stay on the condition of a paternity test. The test showed the child isn't his, so he asked her to leave. Now, people are telling him he's wrong for not helping.\n\nHmm. Legally, since the child isn't his, he has no obligation to support it. But ethically? Well, he was already in a strained relationship. He suspected cheating, which turned out to be confirmed later. The ex might have known the child wasn't his but still came back to stay, possibly manipulating the situation. \n\nThe author's argument is that he's emotionally drained, and the child isn't his. He's been supporting her before, but now that it's not his child, he doesn't want to continue. The ex's mom smoking could be a health issue, so he might have had a valid reason for her to stay with him initially to protect the baby. But since the baby isn't his, that reasoning is gone. \n\nBut some might argue that the baby is still a child in need, regardless of parentage. However, the author isn't the biological father, so his responsibility isn't legally or morally bound in the same way. The ex's actions (cheating, not working) contributed to the relationship's end. Also, if she knew the child wasn't his, coming back under false pretenses could be seen as deceitful. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is being blamed for not helping. But he's not responsible for a child that isn't his. The mutual friends might not see the history of their relationship. The author is in a vulnerable emotional state, which might cloud judgment, but he's making a decision based on his own well-being. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. He made a decision based on the test results and personal circumstances. The child isn't his, and he's not obligated to care for someone else's child, especially after the relationship's issues. The ex's responsibility towards the child is her own. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
