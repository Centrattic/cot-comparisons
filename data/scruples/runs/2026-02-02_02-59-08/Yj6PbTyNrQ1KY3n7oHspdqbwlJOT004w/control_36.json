It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for kicking their pregnant girlfriend out after finding out the child isn't theirs.\n\nFirst, the key points from the story: The couple had a rocky relationship towards the end, with the girlfriend losing her job and relying on the author's financial support. The author suspected cheating, broke up, and she went to live with her parents. Then she comes back pregnant and wants to stay with him because her mom smokes. They agree to a paternity test, which comes back negative. The author then asks her to leave. Now, mutual friends are criticizing him for not helping the child.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author is wrong for not allowing the girlfriend to stay in his home. Legally, if the child isn't his, he has no obligation to support it. Emotionally, he's been through a breakup, suspicion of cheating, and betrayal, which might explain his reaction. However, the girlfriend might need support, and he's being criticized for not providing shelter.\n\nBut the question is about being \"in the wrong.\" From a moral standpoint, some might argue that he's being selfish by not helping, especially if the woman is in a vulnerable position. Others might say he's justified because the child isn't his and he's not responsible for supporting someone else's child, especially after the relationship ended. Also, the cheating is a significant factor here, adding to the betrayal.\n\nHowever, the author's decision could be seen as heartless if he's aware of her difficult situation. But legally and in terms of responsibility, he's not obligated. The paternity test cleared him of any obligation. He's also under emotional stress. So, the answer might hinge on whether one values personal responsibility and emotional well-being over societal expectations of support.\n\nThe options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). Based on the analysis, there's a balance. But since the child isn't his and he's not legally responsible, combined with the betrayal, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong). However, if the emphasis is on helping someone in need regardless of the circumstances, then A. But given the context of the cheating and the paternity test result, B seems more plausible.\n"
