It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complex, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant ex after finding out the child isn't his. The key points here are the circumstances leading up to the situation. \n\nThe author and his ex were together for two years but had a rocky relationship, especially when she lost her job and stopped looking for work, relying on him financially. He suspected her of cheating and eventually broke up with her, leading her to live with her parents. Then she came back, pregnant, claiming the child was his. He agreed to let her stay under the condition of a paternity test. After the test, which showed the child isn't his, he kicked her out. Now, others are criticizing him for this.\n\nSo, the main question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's look at the factors involved. \n\nFirst, the author's actions are based on the confirmation that the child isn't his. Legally, he has no obligation to support someone else's child. Emotionally and morally, it's more complicated. The author has been through a lot: the breakup, her cheating (which was confirmed), financial strain, and emotional turmoil. He might feel betrayed and not want to take responsibility for a child that isn't his. On the other hand, the woman is pregnant, and the author might be seen as abandoning her in a vulnerable time.\n\nBut here's the thing: he agreed to the arrangement under the condition of a paternity test. Once the test showed the child isn't his, he made a choice to end the living arrangement. That seems to be within his rights. However, the woman is now staying with a friend to avoid her parents' smoking. The author isn't providing her shelter anymore, but she's not forced to stay with him. \n\nThe moral question is whether he's being selfish by not helping someone in need. But he's also dealing with his own emotional state and has been through a lot of betrayal. He might feel that supporting this child, which isn't his, is beyond his capacity, especially given the cheaters' confirmed infidelity. \n\nAnother angle: the author's responsibility to the unborn child. If the child isn't his, he has no legal duty, but moral responsibility could be debated. However, the woman is an adult and responsible for her own actions. The author was supporting her under the assumption of paternity, which was proven false. It's not his obligation to continue support after the test.\n\nPotential counterarguments: He knew there was a possibility of the test being negative but still agreed to let her stay. Some might argue that he should have considered the risk and taken responsibility regardless. Others might say that once the test was done and the result was clear, he was justified in ending the arrangement.\n\nAlso, the mutual friends' criticism that he's a terrible person for not taking care of the child. But it's important to note that the author is dealing with his own emotional trauma. He's been through a cheating partner, financial stress, and the emotional rollercoaster of paternity uncertainty. His decision might be seen as self-preservation.\n\nIn summary, while the author's actions might be seen as harsh, legally he's not in the wrong because the child isn't his. Morally, it's more subjective. But since the question is whether he's in the wrong, the answer would hinge on legal and personal responsibility versus moral obligation. Given the test results and his own circumstances, it's reasonable to say he's not in the wrong, so the answer is B.\n"
