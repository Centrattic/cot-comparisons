It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant girlfriend after finding out the child isn't his. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the ex and the author were together for two years. The relationship got rocky when she lost her job and stopped looking for work, which led him to break up and she left to live with her parents. Then she came back, said she was pregnant, and he let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. She agreed, and they did the test, which showed the child isn't his. He then kicked her out.\n\nNow, the author is being criticized by friends and others for being a bad person for not supporting the child. He's questioning if he was unfair and if he should take care of the child despite the betrayal.\n\nHmm. Legally, if the child isn't his, he has no obligation to provide support. But morally, there's a debate. He's been through a lot: potential fatherhood, cheating suspicions, financial strain, etc. On the other hand, the woman is pregnant and in a vulnerable position. Her parents smoke, so she's staying with a friend. The author is feeling emotionally raw and conflicted.\n\nHe's not in the wrong legally, but morally? Well, he's not the father, so he doesn't have a legal responsibility. But some might argue that he should still help, given the circumstances. However, he's been through a lot of emotional turmoil, and the woman had cheated on him. The fact that she was living off him financially before the breakup might also play into his decision.\n\nThe key points here are the paternity test result and the author's personal boundaries. Since the child isn't his, he's not legally or morally obligated to care for the child. His emotional state and the previous issues in the relationship (cheating, financial strain) contribute to his decision. The friends' opinions might be coming from a place of wanting to help, but the author isn't responsible for this child. So, I think the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
