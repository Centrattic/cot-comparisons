It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant girlfriend after finding out the child isn't his. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the author and his ex were together for two years, but their relationship became rocky. She lost her job and wasn't looking for work, so he was supporting them financially. He suspected cheating, broke up with her, and she left. Then she came back saying she was pregnant, and he let her stay again on the condition of a paternity test. The test came back negative, and he kicked her out. Now she and others are saying he's a bad person for not supporting her and the child.\n\nSo, the main issues here are paternity, financial responsibility, emotional state, and societal expectations. The author was already under stress from the breakup and now the betrayal of her cheating. When the child isn't his, he feels released from the obligation, but others argue he should still help.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the child isn't his, he has no legal obligation to support it. But morally, some might say he should still help because he was involved in the pregnancy. However, the author was already facing a lot of stress and felt used in the relationship. He might not feel responsible for a child that isn't his, especially after the cheating and financial strain.\n\nBut then, others might argue that even if the child isn't his, he should still help out of compassion. However, it's his home, and he has the right to decide who lives there. The fact that he agreed to the paternity test shows he wanted to be responsible, and once it was clear he wasn't the father, he made a choice based on his own circumstances.\n\nIt's also important to consider his mental health. He mentioned feeling emotionally raw and going through every emotion. Being forced to take care of a child that isn't his might add to his stress. On the other hand, the ex is now with her parents, and there might be other support systems.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Legally, probably not. Morally, it's a gray area. He chose to help her when he thought the child was his, which shows responsibility. Once the paternity was negative, he might feel he's not obligated anymore. Others might still expect him to help, but it's not his legal duty. The fact that he allowed her to stay initially because of the smoking issue shows he was trying to be a good person, but once the test came back, he had the right to ask her to leave.\n\nTherefore, the answer might be that he's not in the wrong. He made a decision based on the information he had and his personal circumstances. However, the societal pressure is there, but that doesn't necessarily make his action wrong.\n"
