It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for kicking their pregnant girlfriend out after finding out the child isn't theirs. \n\nFirst, the situation: The ex and the author were together for two years. The relationship was rocky before they broke up, partly because she lost her job and wasn't looking for work, making the author support them both financially. He suspected her of cheating, which led to the breakup. She went to live with her parents.\n\nThen she came back saying she was pregnant and asked to stay with him to avoid her mom's smoking. He agreed but wanted a paternity test. The test showed the child isn't his. He asked her to leave. Now, others are saying he's being unfair and should help the child.\n\nSo, the key points here are paternity, cheating, financial responsibility, and the well-being of the child. \n\nThe author's defense is that the child isn't his, he was already financially supporting her without her contributing, suspected cheating, and is overwhelmed emotionally. He feels the child isn't his responsibility. Others argue that he should help regardless.\n\nLegally, if the child is not his, he isn't obligated to support it. Emotionally, he's been through a lot. However, the pregnant woman is still his ex, and the child exists. There's a moral obligation question here. Did he have a responsibility to support her even if the child isn't his? \n\nBut he didn't know the child wasn't his when he agreed to let her stay. The paternity test was a caveat he set, and she agreed. Once the result came back negative, he felt justified in asking her to leave. So, he followed through with his own condition. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that once he got involved again, he had a moral duty to help her, regardless of paternity. However, if he's not the father, the obligation isn't legal, and he's already been through a stressful relationship. \n\nThe cheating adds another layer. If she cheated, then the child's paternity being someone else's makes sense. He might feel betrayed twice: once by her cheating, and then the child not being his. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. He made a decision based on the test result and his own circumstances. Others might disagree morally, but legally and based on the situation he described, B is the answer.\n"
