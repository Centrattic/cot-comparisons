It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he kicked his pregnant girlfriend out after finding out the child isn't his. They were together for two years, broke up, then she came back when she got pregnant, and he agreed to let her live with him again on the condition of a paternity test. Once the test came back negative, he asked her to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, if a man is not the biological father, he might not have legal obligations towards the child unless he's been married to the mother or has legally adopted the child. So maybe he isn't legally responsible, which could be a point in his favor.\n\nThen there's the emotional and ethical side. He suspected she was cheating, and it turns out she was. The betrayal might have contributed to his decision. He's also mentioned that he's been through a lot emotionally, which might explain his reaction. However, the fact that she's pregnant and he's now rejecting her and the child could be seen as abandoning someone in a vulnerable state. The friends are criticizing him for being a terrible person, which suggests societal expectations might pressure him to be more supportive regardless of paternity.\n\nOn the other hand, he's not the father, so maybe he's justified in not taking responsibility. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong morally or ethically. If he's not under legal obligation, does that absolve him morally? Some might say that if he was in a committed relationship and treated her as his partner, he might still have a moral duty to support her, even if the child isn't his. Others might argue that once paternity is confirmed as negative, he has no duty.\n\nAlso, the context of her living with her parents where there's smoking, which he wanted to avoid for the child's health, is a point he made. But after the paternity test, he's still not taking her in, even though the health issue remains. Is he being selfish by not helping her despite the negative environment?\n\nHe also mentions feeling emotionally raw and conflicted. It's a complex situation where his feelings of betrayal and emotional state are factors. But the question is whether he's in the wrong for his actions. The key points are: he agreed to the paternity test, she was aware of the condition. Once the result came in, he honored it by asking her to leave. Legally he's not responsible, but morally, some might argue he should still help if he's part of her life. Others might say he's not obligated.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether societal or moral obligations extend beyond biological fatherhood. If the relationship was stable and he was part of her life, maybe he's expected to support her regardless. But if he's not the father, then perhaps it's not his responsibility. The question is whether he's in the wrong. Considering that he was not the father, and he made a condition before agreeing to her staying, his decision might be seen as not wrong. However, if the argument is that he should support her regardless of paternity due to being in a relationship, then he might be in the wrong. It's a bit of a gray area, but given the information, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because he's not the biological father and he followed through on the condition he set. However, others might argue that emotional support is still necessary, making it a bit of a toss-up. But based on the details given, I think the answer is B.\n"
