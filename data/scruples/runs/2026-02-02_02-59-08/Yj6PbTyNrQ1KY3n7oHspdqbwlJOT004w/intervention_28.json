It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author found out the child his ex is pregnant with isn't his, and he kicked her out of his house. He had initially agreed to let her stay to protect the child from her parents' smoking. Now he's facing criticism for not supporting her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, in many places, a man isn't considered the legal father unless he's married or has legally acknowledged paternity. Since the paternity test showed he's not the father, he might not have a legal obligation to support the child. But ethically, it's more complex. Even if he's not the biological father, he might feel a moral obligation if he thought he was. On the other hand, he was in a relationship and might have expected the other person to be faithful, which she wasn't. That could influence his decision to leave her.\n\nThe ex cheated on him, which adds to his emotional turmoil. He's feeling betrayed, and the pregnancy was part of his emotional healing. Now, with the truth out, he's struggling with his feelings towards the child. His friends are telling him to take responsibility, but he's not sure if he should. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the child is innocent here. The author isn't the biological father, so he might feel he has no duty. However, if he had taken on a role as a supportive partner, even after the breakup, there could be a social expectation to help. But he had conditions set with the paternity test, and once that was cleared, he followed through. \n\nThe ex is now staying with friends to avoid her parents' smoking, which the author wanted to protect the child from. But now that he's kicked her out, the child's environment might be worse. However, the author isn't the father, so he might not feel responsible. \n\nEmotionally, he's been through a lot. The cheating and the pregnancy were big stressors. His decision to ask her to leave after the test result is a reaction to the betrayal. But some might argue that once you're involved in a pregnancy, you have a responsibility, regardless of paternity. \n\nIn terms of societal expectations, there's often pressure to support the mother and child even if you're not the father, especially if you were in a relationship. However, the author was clear about the paternity test condition, so he might feel justified. \n\nI need to weigh the author's rights to his own emotional well-being against the potential harm to the child. If the child is with the biological father or another support system, maybe it's okay. But if the ex is struggling and the author could help without obligation, that's a gray area. \n\nUltimately, whether he's in the wrong depends on perspective. Legally, he might not be obligated, but ethically, it's debatable. Since the question is about being \"in the wrong\" in a moral sense, the answer might hinge on intentions and circumstances. The author's actions were based on the test result and his own emotional state, which could be seen as unfair to the child, but he's also within his rights to prioritize his own well-being after being deceived.\n"
