It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for kicking his pregnant ex out after finding out the child isn't his. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the man and his ex were together for two years. The relationship became rocky when she lost her job and didn't look for work, leading to financial strain. He suspected cheating and eventually broke up. She moved in with her parents, but then came back pregnant, claiming it was his child. He agreed to let her stay, with the condition of a paternity test. After the test showed the child isn't his, he asked her to leave.\n\nNow, the friends and others are criticizing him for being a terrible person. He's conflicted between his feelings of betrayal and the pressure to help the child. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nStarting with the legal aspect, a man isn't legally obligated to support a child that isn't his. So from a legal standpoint, he's not in the wrong. Ethically, it's trickier. He wasn't the father, and she had already cheated, which is a significant breach of trust. However, the child is an innocent party. But he had agreed to the paternity test and followed through. Once the test was done, he had the right to make his own decision about his living arrangements.\n\nEmotionally, he's been through a lot. The betrayal, financial strain, and the stress of possibly being a father. His decision to ask her to leave can be seen as a way to protect his mental health and set boundaries. However, the child's well-being is a factor. If the ex is staying with her parents where there are smoking issues, maybe he could have considered other options for her, but he's not responsible for her current living situation.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that he still has a moral responsibility to help an innocent child, even if they're not his. But he's not the father, and she had already misled him. If she had known the child wasn't his from the start, he might not have been in the situation. She has a responsibility to care for her child, regardless of the father's identity.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's decision is legally sound and ethically justified given the circumstances. He followed through with the agreed-upon paternity test and made a decision based on the outcome. His emotional state is valid, and he's not obligated to help in a situation where he was deceived. However, there's a gray area regarding the child's well-being. But since he's not the father, his responsibility isn't the same as a biological parent's.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong), but with some nuance. He made a tough choice based on the test results and his own well-being, which is understandable. The key points are the legal non-obligation, the prior betrayal, and the agreed-upon conditions. While others might expect him to help, his decision is personal and within his rights.\n"
