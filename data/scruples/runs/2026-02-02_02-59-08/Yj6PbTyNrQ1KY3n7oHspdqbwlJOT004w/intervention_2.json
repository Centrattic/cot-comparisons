It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for kicking their pregnant girlfriend out after finding out the child isn't theirs.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and his ex were together for two years. They broke up because she wasn't working and he suspected cheating. She left to live with her parents. Then she came back saying she's pregnant, and he let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. When the test showed the child isn't his, he kicked her out. Now friends are telling him he's wrong for not helping the child.\n\nSo the main issue here is whether he's obligated to support a child that isn't his, especially after the relationship issues. Legally, if the paternity test proves he's not the father, he doesn't have legal responsibility. But socially and morally, the question is trickier. He might feel a connection since he thought he was the father, and now he's distancing himself. However, the woman had cheated, which could add to his betrayal. But the child is innocent, so some might argue he should still help. \n\nBut on the other hand, he's going through emotional turmoil. He's been through the stress of possible fatherhood and discovering cheating. The woman's family has issues (smoking), so maybe he wanted to protect the child. But once he's not the father, is it fair for him to still take responsibility? \n\nThe author is conflicted between his emotions and societal expectations. Legally, he's not wrong. Morally, it's a gray area. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. If society expects him to help regardless of the test, then yes. But if he's not the biological father, maybe no. Also, the woman's actions (cheating, not working) might have contributed to the breakup. \n\nI think the key points are the paternity test result and the emotional state. The author isn't legally responsible, and he had a condition in place. So, he's not necessarily in the wrong. However, the moral argument is complex. But the question is about being in the wrong, not legal or moral. Since he followed through on his condition and the test showed he wasn't the father, he's not in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
