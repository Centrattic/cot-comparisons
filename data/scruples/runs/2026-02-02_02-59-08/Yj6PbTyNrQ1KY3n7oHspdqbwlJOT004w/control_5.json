It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant ex after finding out the child isn't his. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author and his ex had a two-year relationship. It was rocky, especially when she lost her job and wasn't looking for work, so he had to support both of them financially. He suspected her of cheating, broke up, and she went to live with her parents. Then she comes back to tell him she's pregnant, assuming it's his. He lets her stay, with the condition of a paternity test. They do the test, it's not his, and he kicks her out. Now, people are saying he's a bad person for not helping the child.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's look at the key points. Legally, if the child isn't his, he has no obligation to support it. Emotionally, he's been through a lot\u2014cheating, financial strain, breakup. He agreed to help initially when he thought it was his child but changed his mind after the paternity test. But others are pressuring him to take responsibility.\n\nBut there's a nuance here. The ex was living with him for a few weeks before the test. Did he have any reason to believe she might be cheating during that time? The test confirmed his suspicion. So, he's not the biological father, which removes his legal and maybe moral obligation. However, the child is still a vulnerable individual. He might be seen as abandoning them, even if it's not his legal responsibility. \n\nBut from his perspective, he's been through a lot. He's emotionally stressed, and the betrayal from cheating probably made him feel used. He's not the father, so he's not legally responsible. However, some might argue that he could still choose to help out of compassion. But others might say he's not obligated and has the right to prioritize his own well-being after the betrayal.\n\nThe ex's mom smokes, which is a health risk, so the author initially thought it was his child and wanted to protect the unborn child. Now that he knows it's not his, he's under pressure to take her in. But he's not the biological father, so it's not his responsibility. However, the question is about morality, not just legality. \n\nIn terms of morality, there's a debate. If he knew the child wasn't his, he's not responsible for supporting it. But if he had resources and the ability, some might say he should help. But others would say it's not his duty. Since he already went through a difficult breakup and found out about the cheating, his emotional state is valid. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong. He's not legally responsible, and he's within his rights to not support a child that isn't his. The pressure from others might be unwarranted if he didn't promise to take care of the child regardless. However, the moral argument is tricky. But since the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" the answer depends on whether he had any legal or moral obligations. Since he doesn't, the answer is B (No).\n"
