It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for kicking his pregnant girlfriend out after finding out the child isn't his. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation thoroughly. The author and his ex had a two-year relationship that ended when he suspected cheating and she lost her job, leading to financial strain. After the breakup, she came back saying she was pregnant, and they agreed to a paternity test. Once the test showed the child isn't his, he asked her to leave. Now, there's criticism from others saying he's being cruel to the unborn child.\n\nThe key points here are: the author's reasons for the breakup were cheating and financial issues, the pregnancy was a surprise, and the paternity test revealed the child isn't his. He feels emotionally raw and conflicted about his decision.\n\nLegally, paternity is a big factor. If the test proves he's not the father, he isn't legally obligated to support the child. However, morally or socially, there might be expectations of support. The author's decision could be seen as protecting himself emotionally and financially, especially after the cheating and financial burden. On the other hand, some might argue that he should take responsibility regardless.\n\nBut wait, the girlfriend knew she was cheating. The author's trust was broken, and the pregnancy wasn't his. He's not the legal father. From a legal standpoint, he's not wrong. Emotionally, he's dealing with betrayal and the stress of an unexpected pregnancy, which might justify his actions. However, social judgments often differ. Some people might see him as abandoning an innocent child, but if he's not the father, maybe his responsibility is lessened.\n\nThe author's ex is staying with friends to escape her parents' smoking, so the issue isn't just about her, but also the child's environment. However, the author isn't the father, so his responsibility isn't the same as a biological parent. He might feel pressured by friends and others to help, but he's within his rights to prioritize his own well-being.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong. The key factors are the confirmed non-paternity and his right to decide his living situation. His decision is a personal choice, and while others may judge, legally and morally (if considering only biological ties), he isn't obligated to take care of the child. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
