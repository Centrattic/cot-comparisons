It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he kicked his pregnant ex out after finding out the child isn't his. They were together for two years, had a rocky relationship, she lost her job, he suspected cheating, they broke up, she left. Then she came back saying she's pregnant, he let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. The test came back negative, and he told her to leave. Now friends are saying he's a bad person for not helping the unborn child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, if the author isn't the biological father, he isn't obligated to support the child. But ethically, it's more complicated. If he was involved with the mother and had thought the child was his, maybe there's an expectation of support. But since the paternity was confirmed, maybe he's within his rights to not take responsibility. However, some might argue that even if he's not the biological father, he might have a moral obligation if he was part of the mother's life and contributed to her well-being.\n\nThen there's the emotional aspect. He mentions feeling betrayed because she cheated, which adds to the complexity. Cheating is a serious issue that could contribute to the breakup. But does that justify his actions now? He might feel hurt and not want to be involved with a child that isn't his, especially after the emotional turmoil. However, the child is innocent here, and some might see the author as abandoning the mother and child in a vulnerable time, regardless of the paternity.\n\nAnother angle is the mother's situation. She's pregnant and might be in a difficult position, living with parents who smoke, so the author offered a better environment. Now that he's kicked her out, she's moving in with a friend. Some might argue that he's abandoning her when she needs support, even if he's not the father. On the other hand, he's under no legal obligation, and his emotional state is a factor he's considering.\n\nThe opinions of mutual friends also play a role here. They think he's being unfair, but the author is struggling with his feelings. It's a balance between personal boundaries and societal expectations. If he's not the father, he might not have a legal duty, but morally, some might expect him to help if he's in a position to do so.\n\nIn summary, the key points are: legal obligations (none if not the father), emotional history (cheating and breakup), current situation (mother's needs), and societal expectations. Whether he's in the wrong depends on how much weight is given to legal vs. moral responsibilities. Since the law doesn't require him to support the child, some might say he's not in the wrong. However, others might argue that he should help regardless, making it a moral issue. The answer hinges on where one draws the line between personal responsibility and legal obligations.\n"
