It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is asking if he was wrong to kick his pregnant ex-girlfriend out after finding out the child isn't his. They were together for two years, broke up when she wasn't working and he suspected cheating. She came back saying she was pregnant, they agreed to a paternity test. After the test showed it wasn't his, he made her leave. Now he's conflicted because others say he's being cruel to the child.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect: If the child isn't his, he's not legally obligated to support it. Paternity tests are conclusive, so he's not the father. But there's the emotional and moral side. He had let her stay in his home under the condition of the test. Once the result came back negative, he felt relieved and decided to end the arrangement. The ex and others are pressuring him to take responsibility.\n\nThe key points here are consent and agreement. He allowed her to stay with the condition of a paternity test. She agreed to that. Once the test showed he wasn't the father, he's within his rights to end the arrangement. However, some might argue that once he allowed her to stay, he took on some responsibility, especially since there's a child involved. But since he's not the father, that responsibility is less clear.\n\nEmotionally, he's dealing with betrayal (confirmed cheating) and the stress of a potential fatherhood, which is a lot. The ex's cheating adds to his hurt, which might influence his decision. However, the child isn't at fault here. The argument is whether he has a moral obligation to the child now that he knows he's not the father.\n\nSome might say he's being selfish, prioritizing his own emotional state over the child's well-being. Others would argue that he's not responsible since he's not the biological father, and he had a prior agreement. The situation is tricky because the child's needs are important, but so is the author's right to his living space and emotional health.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, legally he's not in the wrong. Morally, it's a gray area. The ex and others are saying he should help, but he's not the father. However, if he's in a position to help and chooses not to, some might see that as selfish. But given the circumstances\u2014cheating, prior breakup, and the paternity test agreement\u2014it's reasonable for him to end the arrangement once the test is done. So, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
