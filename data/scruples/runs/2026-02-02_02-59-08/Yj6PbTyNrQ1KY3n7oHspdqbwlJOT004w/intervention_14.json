It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant girlfriend after a paternity test revealed the child isn't his. \n\nFirst, the situation: They were in a 2-year relationship. The ex was living with him after losing her job and the relationship ended. She came back saying she's pregnant, and he agreed to let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. After the test shows the child isn't his, he asks her to leave.\n\nNow, the key points. The author suspects cheating, which is later confirmed. He feels betrayed and emotionally raw. The ex is staying with friends to avoid her parents' smoking. Mutual friends are pressuring him to take her back. The question is whether he's in the wrong for not wanting to take care of the child.\n\nLegally, if the child isn't his, he has no obligation. Emotionally, he's been through a breakup, possible infidelity, and financial strain. But there's also the aspect of the unborn child's well-being. He doesn't have a legal responsibility, but some might argue he's being harsh because the child is vulnerable. However, the mother chose to come to him, knowing the child isn't his, and he had conditions set before agreeing to let her stay. Once the test results were in, he followed through on his condition. \n\nThe ex's friends are calling him a bad person, but he might be protecting his emotional state. There's also the argument that he's not responsible for someone else's child. On the flip side, if he's wealthy, maybe he should help, but the story doesn't mention his financial status. It's possible he's struggling financially as he supported her before.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, since he's not the father, he's not obligated. But some might see it as a lack of compassion. However, given the circumstances of the relationship ending and cheating, his reaction is understandable. The paternity test was a condition, and he honored it. So, from a fairness standpoint, maybe he's not in the wrong. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of the child's needs. However, since it's not his child, others might argue he's not responsible. The ex is capable of taking care of herself with her parents and friends. So, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because he followed through on his condition and has no legal obligation. However, some might still see it as harsh. But since the question is about being in the wrong, and he's not legally or morally required, B seems correct.\n"
