It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for kicking his pregnant girlfriend out after finding out the child isn't his. The situation involves a complicated relationship history, financial stress, suspicion of cheating, and the paternity test result.\n\nFirst, the author and his ex had a two-year relationship that ended because she was unemployed, relying on him financially, and he suspected her of cheating. She moved in with her parents after the breakup but then came back when she found out she was pregnant. He agreed to let her stay again to protect the unborn child from her mother's smoking. They agreed to a paternity test. When the test showed the child wasn't his, he asked her to leave.\n\nNow, the key points here are the consent to let her stay with the condition of the test, the result revealing non-paternity, and the subsequent decision to have her leave. The author is being criticized by mutual friends for being a \"terrible person\" for not supporting the child. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the author is not the biological father, he has no legal obligation to support the child. However, if he had assumed the role of a parent (like providing for her financially during her stay), there might be legal implications. But the user's question is more about moral responsibility.\n\nEmotionally, the author is dealing with the betrayal of being cheated on. The paternity test confirmed it. He's been through a lot, and his decision to end the living arrangement is a reaction to that betrayal. But the child is innocent here. The ex is the mother, and even if the author isn't the father, he might still have a moral obligation to support the mother, especially if he's been financially supporting her.\n\nHowever, the author isn't the child's parent. If the mother is capable of caring for the child, maybe he's not in the wrong. But if the mother is struggling and the author could help, then maybe he's expected to support her, even if he's not the father. But the situation is complicated by the fact that he had already broken up with her due to her not working and financial dependency.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the author's own well-being. He's emotionally raw and might not be in a good place to take on the responsibility of supporting a child, especially after the betrayal. But others are pressuring him to help, which adds to the conflict.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's decision to ask her to leave after the paternity test result is understandable from his perspective. He's not the father, and the relationship was already over. However, there's a moral argument that he should still help if possible, especially if the mother is in a vulnerable position. But since he's not a parent, maybe it's not his responsibility. It's a tough call, but leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because he's not the father and the relationship ended under difficult circumstances.\n"
