It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong after kicking out his pregnant girlfriend when the child isn't his.\n\nFirst, the man and his ex had a two-year relationship. It ended because she lost her job and wasn't looking for work, leading him to break up. She left to live with her parents. Then she came back saying she was pregnant. He let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. She agreed, and they did the test. When it turned out the child isn't his, he kicked her out. Now, others are telling him he's a bad person for not helping the unborn child, but he's conflicted.\n\nSo, the key points here: He thought he was the father but isn't. He had already ended the relationship due to her job situation and possible infidelity. Now that he's not the father, he doesn't want to support the child. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nLegally, if he's not the biological father, he has no legal obligation to support the child. Emotionally, it's a different story. He might feel responsible if he thought he was the father, but once the paternity is proven, that's a key factor. Also, the woman did cheat, which adds complexity. She might have known about the cheating during the time of conception. However, the man's decision to kick her out is based on the betrayal and not wanting to support someone else's child.\n\nBut the community is pressuring him to take care of the child. The argument is whether he has a moral obligation. Some might say he's not responsible since he's not the father, while others might expect him to step up if he thought he was. However, the reality is that legal responsibility is tied to biological parentage. Without that, he's not obligated. The emotional turmoil he's experiencing is valid, but the decision to leave is his right.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the child's well-being. If the mother is staying with friends to avoid smoke, maybe her parents aren't providing a safe environment. However, the man can't be forced to provide a home unless there's a legal obligation. The friends' messages might be based on emotional appeal rather than legal or ethical necessity.\n\nIn summary, the man isn't in the wrong because he's not the biological father, and there's no legal duty. The moral question is more subjective, but legally and ethically, he's not obligated to support someone else's child. The fact that he allowed her to stay after the test shows he was willing to help if he was the father, but once proven otherwise, he's justified in his decision.\n"
