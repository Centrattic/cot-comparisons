It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant girlfriend when he found out the child wasn't his. \n\nFirst, the key points from the story: The ex and author were together for two years. They broke up because she was unemployed and he suspected cheating. She then comes back saying she's pregnant, and they agree to a paternity test. After the test shows he's not the father, he kicks her out. Now, others are criticizing him for not helping the unborn child.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author is wrong for not supporting the child after finding out it's not his. Let's consider legal and ethical aspects. Legally, if he's not the biological father, he's not obligated to support the child. However, there's the question of moral responsibility. If he had been in a relationship with the mother, does he still have a duty to help? But he already ended the relationship, and the pregnancy wasn't known when they broke up. \n\nThe ex's behavior was problematic: she was unemployed, living off him, and he suspected cheating. After the breakup, she returned for support, but then the paternity test revealed otherwise. He might feel betrayed, especially if cheating was confirmed. The mother's family environment is also poor, with smoking, which he wanted to avoid for the child.\n\nHowever, the author is being criticized for not helping the child. But if the child isn't his, he isn't legally responsible. The question is whether he has a moral obligation. Arguments could be made both ways. Some might say he's justified in his decision given the circumstances and the betrayal. Others might argue that the child is innocent and deserves support regardless.\n\nAnother angle: the author's emotional state. He's been through a lot, and the stress of possibly being a father, followed by the betrayal, could affect his capacity to support the child. But does that excuse his decision? Maybe not, but it adds context.\n\nAlso, the author had allowed her to stay for a paternity test as a good-faith gesture. Once the test cleared him, he's within his rights to not take responsibility. The pressure from friends might be influencing him, but he needs to decide based on his own values.\n\nIn terms of fairness to the unborn child, the author isn't the biological parent, so the child's needs would fall to the mother and her actual father. The author isn't in a position to make decisions about the child's care unless there's a legal agreement or custody arrangement, which there isn't here.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. He's not legally obligated, and given the history of the relationship, his decision to leave is understandable. The answer would be B (No).\n"
