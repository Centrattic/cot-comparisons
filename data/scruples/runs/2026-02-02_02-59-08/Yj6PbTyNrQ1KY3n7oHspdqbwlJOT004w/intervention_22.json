It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for kicking his pregnant girlfriend out after finding out the child isn't his.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the situation. The guy and his ex were together for two years. The relationship was rocky, with her losing her job and him supporting them. He suspected cheating, broke up, she left. Then she comes back saying she's pregnant, he allows her back under the condition of a paternity test. The test shows the kid isn't his, so he kicks her out. Now, people are telling him he's a bad person for not helping the child and unborn baby.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong. They want to know if I agree. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nSo, the key points here. Legally, paternity is usually established by the man's name on the birth certificate, but if it's proven the child isn't his, he's not legally obligated. However, there's a moral component. The author had previously accepted the responsibility of being a father, even if tentatively. Once he found out it wasn't his, he cut off support. \n\nBut is he in the wrong? Well, the woman cheated, so he might feel betrayed. However, the unborn child isn't responsible for the mother's actions. The author is being asked if he's willing to take care of the child, not the mother. Some might argue that once he agreed to be part of the pregnancy, he had a moral obligation, even if it's not his child. Others might say he's within his rights to walk away since he's not the biological father. \n\nThere's also the aspect of the mother's living conditions. She's staying with a friend to avoid her parents' smoking. The author had allowed her to stay to protect the child from secondhand smoke. By kicking her out, he's putting the child in a potentially harmful environment. \n\nBut the author is emotionally raw and feels he's been through a lot. His friends are pressuring him to take them in, but he's conflicted. The question is about whether he's in the wrong. \n\nIn terms of societal expectations, there's often pressure on men to take responsibility for children they father, even if by mistake. However, if the child isn't his, the obligation may not be as clear. But if he had accepted the role as a father, even temporarily, then abandoning the child might be seen as abandoning the responsibility he voluntarily took on. \n\nSo, the argument for A (he's in the wrong) would be that once he agreed to support the pregnancy and the child, even if the child isn't his, he's now in a position where he's responsible for their well-being, especially if he's aware of the harmful environment they might be in otherwise. \n\nThe argument for B (he's not in the wrong) would be that he's not the biological father, has been through an emotionally abusive relationship, and is now choosing to prioritize his own well-being. Legally, he's not obligated, and morally, he might feel it's not his responsibility, especially given the mother's infidelity. \n\nBut considering the mother's actions and the child's welfare, if the author had a role in ensuring the child's safety (by keeping them out of a smoky home), then walking away might be seen as neglecting that responsibility. However, if the mother is now staying with a friend, maybe that's a sufficient alternative. \n\nI think the key here is that once the author allowed the mother to stay with him under the pretense of being the father, he may have created a dependency on him for the child's care. Once the paternity was disproven, he might feel justified in leaving, but the child's well-being is still a concern. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at both legal and moral obligations. Since the child isn't his, legally he's not responsible. But morally, if he allowed the mother to stay for the child's benefit, then cutting her off might leave the child in a worse situation. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because he's aware of the mother's living conditions and by kicking her out, he's potentially endangering the child's health. Even if he's not the father, he might have a moral obligation to ensure the child's well-being, especially after he had a role in that arrangement. Alternatively, if the mother is now with a friend, maybe that's acceptable. \n\nBut the main point is, he was the one who allowed her to stay to protect the child, and now by removing her, he's contributing to the child being in a worse place. So, he might be in the wrong. However, others might argue that he's not the father and has a right to his emotional state. \n\nHmm. I think the answer is A because he's aware of the risks and chose to let her stay for the child's benefit. Now that the paternity is proven, he's still in a position where the child's welfare is a concern, especially if the alternative living conditions are harmful. So, he might be in the wrong for not ensuring the child's safety after having a role in that arrangement.\n"
