It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. First, I need to understand the situation thoroughly. The person wrote about their ex-girlfriend, who they had been with for two years. The relationship was rocky because she lost her job and stopped looking for work, making them financially support both. They suspected she was cheating and eventually broke up, leading her to go live with her parents.\n\nThen she comes back saying she's pregnant. The author lets her stay again to avoid her being around her parents' smoking. They agree to a paternity test. The test comes back negative, and the author kicks her out. Now, mutual friends are saying the author is a bad person for not taking care of the child.\n\nThe question is whether the author was wrong to kick her out. Let's break it down. The author had already broken up with her because she was living off them and possibly cheating. Then, after accepting her back due to health concerns for the baby (smoking), the paternity test shows the child isn't his. So, he ends the cohabitation again.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the child isn't his, he isn't obligated to support it. Emotionally, he's been through a lot\u2014cheating, possible fatherhood, betrayal. The ex knew he wanted the test and agreed to it. The author isn't in a legal or moral obligation to take care of someone else's child. However, some might argue that he should still help because the ex is struggling. But since the child isn't his, and he's already ended the relationship, it's his right to not support it. The friends' pressure might be about social expectations, but the author's decision is based on his own circumstances and the test results. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
