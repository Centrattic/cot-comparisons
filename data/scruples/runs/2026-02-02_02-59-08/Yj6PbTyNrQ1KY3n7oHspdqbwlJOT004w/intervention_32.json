It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for kicking his pregnant ex out after finding out the child isn't his. Hmm. Let's break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author and his ex were in a relationship for two years. The relationship got rocky when she lost her job and stopped looking for work, relying on his financial support. He suspected cheating, broke up with her, and she left to live with her parents. Then she came back, told him she was pregnant, and he agreed to let her stay, provided they get a paternity test. She agreed. After the test came back negative, he kicked her out.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author had suspicions of cheating, which were later confirmed when the child isn't his. He agreed to let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. Once that test negated his paternity, he decided to leave her. Now, people are saying he's a bad person for not taking care of the child, even though it's not his.\n\nI need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author had a right to know if he was the father. By agreeing to the paternity test, he was acting responsibly. Once it turned out the child isn't his, he's not obligated to support it financially or otherwise. That's a legal fact. However, the emotional angle complicates things. He's being criticized for not helping the pregnant woman and the child, even though he's not the father.\n\nBut wait, he did agree to let her stay initially because her mother's smoking was a problem. So he had good intentions when allowing her to stay. But once he found out the child isn't his, he felt betrayed and decided to end the arrangement. Now, the ex and others are pressuring him to take her back for the child's sake.\n\nThe author's main argument is that he's been through emotional turmoil, the cheating was confirmed, and he's not the father. He's struggling between his moral feelings and the reality of the situation. The people around him think he should take care of the child regardless because it's vulnerable. But legally and ethically, does he have that responsibility?\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, since he's not the biological father, he's not responsible for child support or custody unless he voluntarily assumes it. Ethically, though, it's a gray area. Some might argue that even if he's not the father, he might have developed an emotional connection or responsibility by allowing her to stay. Others might say that once the paternity is proven false, he's under no obligation and can walk away.\n\nThe ex's actions: she came back with the pregnancy news, which the author believed at first. Then she agreed to the test. After the test, she knew the child wasn't his. She might have known beforehand, but if she didn't, there's a possibility she was being honest initially. However, the fact that she cheated could tie into the paternity issue. If she cheated with someone else and got pregnant, the biological father is someone else. The author's trust was broken, which adds to his emotional distress.\n\nNow, the question is whether it's fair for him to kick her out. Legally, he's not in the wrong. Ethically, it's more complex. Some might say he's being selfish by not supporting the child, even if it's not his. Others might say he's justified in not wanting to be tied to a situation where he's not responsible. The ex's friends are pressuring him, but everyone has the right to make their own decisions, especially regarding their homes and resources.\n\nIn the end, the author is dealing with betrayal and emotional strain. His decision to leave her out of his home is his choice, even if it's harsh. So, considering all these factors, the answer would be that he's not in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
