It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for kicking his pregnant girlfriend out after finding out the child isn't his. \n\nFirst, the situation: They were together for two years, then broke up because she lost her job and wasn't working, relying on him financially. He suspected cheating. She came back saying she was pregnant, he let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. The test showed it's not his, so he asked her to leave. Now people are saying he's a bad person for not helping.\n\nSo, from a legal standpoint, paternity can be tricky. If the test proved he's not the father, he's not legally obligated to support the child. But maybe he had emotional reasons for staying involved before the test. Now that it's not his, he might feel relieved, but the woman is still pregnant and needs support. \n\nBut wait, she cheated on him, so maybe there's a betrayal angle. He allowed her to stay under the assumption it was his child, then when it's not, he wants her out. But she's still pregnant, and he might still have some responsibility if he was in a relationship with the mother. However, since the child isn't his, maybe he's not responsible. \n\nBut the problem is that the woman might be in a worse position now\u2014her parents smoke, so she's staying with a friend. Is he morally obligated to take her in even though he's not the father? That's the crux. \n\nSome might say he's not in the wrong because he's not the father and was betrayed. Others might say he should help because he was part of her life and she's vulnerable. But legally and ethically, since he's not the father, he might not have a duty. However, the emotional aspect is there. He's being accused of being a terrible person, but if he's not the father, maybe he's not obligated. \n\nBut maybe there's a middle ground. Could he help in other ways, like financially or emotionally, without taking her back? That's another angle. But the question is about being in the wrong. If he's not the father, then maybe not. However, if he had a relationship with her, some might expect him to support her regardless. \n\nI think the key points are the paternity test result, the cheating, and the living arrangements. Since the child isn't his, he's not legally responsible, and he might feel he's not in the wrong for leaving her out. But morally, some might argue he should help. But the answer options are Yes (A) or No (B). Given that, the answer might be B (No) because he's not the father, but others might say A because of moral responsibility. The Reddit-style \"Am I the Asshole\" usually has a community judgment, but here the answer is based on analysis. \n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. Considering the facts, the author isn't legally obligated, but the moral aspect is debatable. However, since the community might split, but given the setup, the answer is likely B (he's not in the wrong).\n"
