It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant girlfriend after finding out the child isn't his. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The couple was together for two years but had a rocky end when the girlfriend lost her job and stopped looking for work, leading the man to support them financially. He suspected cheating and eventually broke up, but she came back saying she was pregnant. He let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. After the test came back negative, he asked her to leave. Now, others are saying he's being cruel for not helping the unborn child.\n\nI need to consider legal, ethical, and emotional angles. Legally, in many places, a man is only required to support a child if paternity is established. Since the test showed he's not the father, he has no legal obligation. So from a legal standpoint, he's not obligated to take care of the child. However, ethically, some might argue that once he believed he was the father, he had a moral responsibility, but since the test proved otherwise, that might not hold up. \n\nEmotionally, the man went through a lot: breakup, possible cheating, financial strain, and then the betrayal of being the father. The emotional turmoil is significant. He's also dealing with others pressuring him to take responsibility. \n\nBut then there's the unborn child's well-being. Even if the man isn't the biological father, the mother is still pregnant and needs support. However, the mother's parents smoke, which is harmful, so the man provided a safe place. Now that she's pregnant with someone else's child, is he still responsible? The mother's health and the child's environment matter. If he's not the father, maybe the responsibility shifts to the biological father or the mother. \n\nAnother angle: the man's trust was broken. The girlfriend had been cheating, and the child isn't his. The man might feel betrayed on multiple levels\u2014emotionally and financially. He might feel that supporting a child that isn't his is unfair, especially after all the stress she caused. \n\nBut then, the argument is that the unborn child is innocent and needs care regardless of the circumstances. However, the mother is still the legal guardian, so the man's obligation is only if he's the legal father. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer hinges on whether the man is legally and morally responsible. Legally, he's not, so he's not in the wrong. Morally, it's more complex, but since the child isn't his, and he had conditions set for staying, his decision to ask her to leave might be justified. Others might criticize him for being heartless, but legally and based on the information he had, he's making a decision to protect himself after being deceived. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
