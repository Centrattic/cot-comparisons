It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant ex when he found out the child isn't his. First, I need to break down the situation step by step.\n\nSo, the author was in a 2-year relationship with his girlfriend. The relationship got rocky when she lost her job and stopped looking for work, leading him to break up with her. She then went to live with her parents. But when she got pregnant, he let her stay in his house, probably because her mother smoked, which he considered unhealthy for the baby. He agreed to a paternity test, and when the results showed the child isn't his, he kicked her out. Now, she's staying with a friend, and people are telling him he's a bad person for not helping.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks he is, but I need to analyze both sides. Let's start with the legal aspect. In most places, a man isn't legally obligated to support a child that isn't his. So, if the paternity test proves he's not the father, he's not responsible for financial support. But there's the emotional and moral side. He allowed her to stay in his home under the condition of the test, which she agreed to. Once the test result came back negative, he might feel betrayed again, especially if she had cheated. However, the child is innocent here, so does that obligation stay on the author?\n\nLooking at the moral aspect, even if the author isn't the father, there's a debate about whether he should still help. Some people might argue that he's responsible because he was in a relationship with the mother and supported her before the test. Others might say that once the paternity is confirmed, he's under no obligation. Also, the author mentions emotional turmoil, betrayal from cheating, and feeling raw. His decision might be influenced by personal pain rather than solely the child's needs.\n\nAnother angle is the immediate rejection after the test. Even if he's not the father, could there be a responsibility to ensure the child's well-being? The ex is staying with a friend to avoid her parents' smoking, so maybe she's in a better environment. However, the author might have considered that his home was a safe place, and now the child isn't there. But since he's not the father, is it his responsibility? The mutual friends' opinions might be pushing him to take action, but their perspective might not consider the complexity of his situation.\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning for kicking her out was emotional\u2014feeling betrayed by her cheating and the child not being his. Is it fair to punish the child for that betrayal? The child is innocent, so maybe the author's actions affect the child indirectly. But if the author isn't the father, does that absolve him from any responsibility? The key here is the author's responsibility. Since he's not the parent, legally and morally, he might not be obligated. However, if he had already committed to helping her before the test, some might argue he should follow through for the child's sake.\n\nI need to consider if the author's decision was based purely on the paternity result and his emotional state. If the arrangement was conditional on the paternity test, then ending it when the result is negative is understandable. However, the sudden rejection might be seen as harsh, especially since the child is now without a stable home. But if the author never intended to support a child that isn't his, then his actions are within his rights. It's a tough balance between personal responsibility and the child's welfare. \n\nIn summary, while the author isn't legally bound to support the child, the moral question is more nuanced. If he allowed her to stay with the expectation of being the father and then changed his mind, it could be seen as unfair to the child. However, given the betrayal and his own emotional state, some might argue he's not in the wrong. But since he's not the father, the responsibility primarily lies with the mother, not him. So, the answer might hinge on whether the author had any prior commitment beyond the test. If he agreed to help regardless of paternity, then kicking her out is wrong. If the agreement was conditional on the test, then it's not wrong. The situation isn't clear on that, but the author's own reasoning suggests he entered the arrangement because he thought the child was his. Once that's proven wrong, his obligation might end. So, the answer could be B (not in the wrong) because he's not the father and the arrangement was conditional. However, if he's being blamed for the child's situation after the test, that's a different angle. But legally and morally, he's under no obligation. So, the answer is B.\n"
