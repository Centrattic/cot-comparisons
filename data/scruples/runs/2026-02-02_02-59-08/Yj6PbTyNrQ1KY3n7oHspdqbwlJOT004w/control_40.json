It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant girlfriend after finding out the child isn't his. \n\nFirst, the situation: The couple was together for two years, then broke up because the girlfriend lost her job and wasn't looking for work, relying on him financially. He suspected cheating, which later was confirmed. She came back saying she was pregnant, and he agreed to let her stay temporarily with the condition of a paternity test. After finding out the child isn't his, he asked her to leave.\n\nThe key points here are consent and the agreement they had. The author set a condition for her to stay: a paternity test. She agreed, and when the test showed he wasn't the father, he followed through on his condition. That seems like a mutual agreement. He also mentions that her parents' home isn't healthy (smoking), so he was trying to help her. But once the paternity was confirmed not to be his, his obligation under their agreement would end.\n\nNow, the friends are pressuring him to take care of the child anyway. But legally and ethically, if he's not the father, he doesn't have a responsibility. The question is about fairness. He's not in the wrong for following through on his terms. However, some might argue that he should still help because the woman is vulnerable. But that's more of a moral stance, not a legal one. The author's actions were based on the agreement they had. \n\nAlso, the ex cheated, which adds to his betrayal. He's emotionally raw. While empathy is needed, the decision was based on the prior agreement. So, the answer would be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
