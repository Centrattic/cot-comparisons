It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy who kicked his pregnant ex out of his house after finding out the child isn't his.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The guy and his ex were together for two years. The relationship was rocky because she lost her job and didn't look for work, so he had to support them. He suspected her of cheating and broke up. Then she came back to tell him she was pregnant, and he agreed to let her stay with the caveat of a paternity test.\n\nThe test came back negative, and he asked her to leave. Now, people are saying he's a bad person for not supporting the child. He's conflicted between his emotional state and the pressure to help.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, legally, since the child isn't his, he's not obligated to support them. Emotionally, he's dealing with betrayal and emotional stress. However, there's also the responsibility to the unborn child. Even if it's not his, the child is still a human being. But he's in a vulnerable state himself.\n\nThe ex cheated, which adds to the betrayal. He had agreed to support her under the assumption it was his child. Once that's proven false, his decision to leave makes sense from his perspective. But morally, is it wrong to not take responsibility? It's a tough call. Some might say he's being selfish, others might say he's justified given the circumstances.\n\nI need to consider the legal and ethical angles. Legally, he's not responsible. Ethically, it's more subjective. He might feel he's been wronged, but the child is innocent. However, he's not the biological father, so he can't be forced to support them. The pressure from friends and others could be guilt-tripping him. \n\nIn the end, the decision hinges on personal ethics. If he's not the father, he's not obligated. But if he feels a moral responsibility, maybe he should consider helping. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's not the father, then legally and in terms of direct responsibility, he's not. Emotionally, he might feel conflicted, but the action of kicking her out after the test is understandable given the betrayal and the circumstances. So, the answer would be B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
