It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he kicked out his pregnant ex-girlfriend after finding out the child isn't his. They were together for two years, but it got rocky when she lost her job and was living off him, and he suspected she was cheating. He broke up with her, she left, then came back to tell him she was pregnant. He agreed to let her stay, but only if they did a paternity test. After the test showed he's not the father, he made her leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider his actions. He's the one who broke up with her initially, so maybe that shows some issues. Then, when she comes back with a pregnancy claim, he's supportive at first, but after the paternity test, he kicks her out. Now, people are telling him he's being a bad person for not helping. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nOn one hand, he's not the biological father, so he might feel he has no responsibility. He was already in a stressful situation with her job and his suspicions of cheating. The ex is staying with her parents, but they smoke, so he allowed her to stay with him for the baby's health. But once he found out it's not his, he changed his mind.\n\nBut then again, even if he's not the father, the baby is still a human being. He might be abandoning someone who's vulnerable. Also, the ex's friends are saying he's a terrible person. Maybe he should have considered the baby's well-being regardless of biological ties. But he's also in emotional pain and feels betrayed. He's struggling between his emotions and what's right.\n\nLegally, if he's not the biological father, he might not have legal obligations. However, socially and morally, there's a different perspective. If he was willing to support her during the pregnancy to avoid bad conditions, maybe he should continue to help in some way. But he's not the father, so he's not obligated. However, he might have a moral obligation if he was already providing support.\n\nBut he did make an agreement to let her stay under the condition of the paternity test. Once the test was done, he decided to cut off support. The problem is that the baby is now without a stable home. The author might be acting out of self-preservation but also causing harm to the child. \n\nConsidering both sides, it's a tough call. Legally, he's not in the wrong, but morally, he's being criticized for not helping. The key point is whether he should have continued to support the pregnancy even though he's not the father. Since he's not the father, he's not legally responsible, but the community is pressuring him to do so. However, he's also allowed to prioritize his own emotional state.\n\nBut the baby's well-being is a consideration. If he's capable and there's no legal obligation, is it his responsibility? It's a gray area. The author might be in the wrong if he's withholding help when he can provide it, regardless of biological ties. However, if he's not in a position to handle that responsibility, maybe it's understandable. The fact that he's conflicted and feeling raw might add to the complexity. \n\nI think the answer is A, the author is in the wrong. Even though he's not the biological father, he had the baby in his care temporarily, and cutting off support might leave the child in a vulnerable situation. The ex's friends are pointing out that he has the means and space. So morally, he might have a duty to help, even if he's not the father. His actions could be seen as selfish given the circumstances.\n"
