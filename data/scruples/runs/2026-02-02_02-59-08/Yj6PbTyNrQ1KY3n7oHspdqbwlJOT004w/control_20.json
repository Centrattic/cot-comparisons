It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for kicking his pregnant girlfriend out after finding out the child isn't his. \n\nFirst, the situation: They were together for two years, had a rocky breakup because she lost her job and wasn't looking for work, he suspected cheating. Then she came back saying she's pregnant. He agreed to let her stay but wanted a paternity test. After the test showed it's not his, he kicked her out. Now people are saying he's a terrible person for not helping the unborn child.\n\nHmm. Legally, if he's not the biological father, he might not have a legal obligation to support the child. But ethically, there's a lot to unpack. He had agreed to an arrangement, and she was under the impression he was the father. Once the test came back negative, his feelings changed. He felt betrayed, especially if it turned out she was cheating. But does that justify cutting her off completely?\n\nAlso, the girlfriend is in a vulnerable state, pregnant, and moving back to her parents where there are issues with smoking. The author's home was supposed to be a safe place. Now, others are pressuring him to take her back. He's conflicted, feeling emotionally raw.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, he did agree to let her stay temporarily for the test. After the test, he's not obligated, but maybe the way he handled it was harsh. She's not asking him to be a father, just to help her during her pregnancy and avoid harmful environments. If he's not the father, maybe he's not morally responsible, but some might argue he should still help because he was involved. However, considering she cheated and the emotional toll, it's a complex situation. The answer might depend on personal ethics. But if he's not the father and she's cheating, maybe he's not in the wrong for prioritizing his own well-being.\n"
