It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complex. So the author had a two-year relationship with his girlfriend, but things got rocky when she lost her job and stopped looking for work, leading him to break up with her. She then went to live with her parents. But when she got pregnant, he let her move back in, agreeing to a paternity test. The test came back negative, and he kicked her out. Now people are saying he's being a bad person for not helping.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, a man is not automatically the legal father unless it's established through a paternity test. Since the test proved he's not the father, he has no legal obligation to support the child. Legally, he's not responsible, so maybe that's on his side.\n\nEmotionally and morally, it's trickier. He allowed her to move back in under the assumption he was the father. Once that's proven false, he might feel betrayed, especially if she knew she was sleeping with someone else. But the question is whether he's wrong for not taking her in again. He's dealing with his own emotional trauma here\u2014cheating and financial stress. \n\nOn the other hand, the unborn child might be in a vulnerable situation, and him abandoning them could be seen as heartless. However, he's not the biological father, so he has no legal duty. But morally, is he expected to step in? It depends on the person's ethics. Some might argue that once you agree to support someone, even if you later find out you're not the father, you have a moral obligation. Others might say he's justified in not wanting to take care of someone else's child, especially after the betrayal.\n\nThe author is being criticized by others, but his feelings of being emotionally raw are valid. He's been through a lot\u2014relationship ending, possible infidelity, financial strain, and now the paternity test. It's understandable that he wants to protect himself from further emotional harm.\n\nBut then again, the mother is in a tough spot, and maybe he could have found a way to help without taking her in. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he's not the father, legally he's not obligated, and morally, it's a personal choice. So he's not necessarily wrong for choosing to prioritize his own well-being. But some might still call him out for not helping, which is a social judgment. \n\nSo considering all angles, the author isn't in the wrong legally, and morally, it's a gray area. He's making a personal decision based on his circumstances. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
