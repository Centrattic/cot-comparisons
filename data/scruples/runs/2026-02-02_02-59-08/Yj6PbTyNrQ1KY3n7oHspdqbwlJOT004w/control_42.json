It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he kicked his pregnant ex out after finding out the child isn't his. They had a messy breakup because she was unemployed and he suspected cheating. Then she came back when she found out she was pregnant, and he agreed to let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. When the test showed he wasn't the father, he made her leave again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, if he's not the biological father, he has no legal obligation to support the child. But ethically, it's more complex. He had already agreed to support her when she came back, even before the test. Once he found out it wasn't his child, he might feel relieved, but the woman is still pregnant and vulnerable. \n\nEmotionally, he's going through a lot\u2014betrayal from her cheating and the stress of the situation. But by kicking her out, he might be avoiding responsibility. However, he also has his own well-being to consider. The ex is staying with her parents where there are issues with smoking, so he might have valid concerns about the child's environment. But once the paternity is known, maybe he's not responsible for the child's care.\n\nThe friends are saying he's being unfair, but he's questioning his own actions. The key points here are: the paternity test result, his previous agreement to support her, and the current circumstances of the ex. Legally, he's not the father, so he's not obligated. But morally, some might argue he should still help because he had a relationship with the mother. However, others might say he's not responsible since it's not his child.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether there's an expectation of support beyond biological ties. Since he's not the father and she's now with her parents, even if there are issues, maybe he's not in the wrong for prioritizing his own emotional state. But there's also the aspect of the child's well-being. However, since the child isn't his, his legal and ethical obligations are different. So the answer might be B (he's not in the wrong), but it's a close call.\n"
