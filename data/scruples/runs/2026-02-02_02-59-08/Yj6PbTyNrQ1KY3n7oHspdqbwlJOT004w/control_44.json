It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy who kicked his pregnant girlfriend out after finding out the child isn't his. They had a tumultuous relationship, she lost her job, he suspected cheating, then she came back pregnant. They agreed on a paternity test, and when it came back negative, he asked her to leave.\n\nFirst, the key points: The man had the right to know paternity, which he did through a test. Once it's confirmed the child isn't his, he's not obligated to support someone else's child. The woman cheated, which adds to his emotional distress. Friends are pressuring him to take her back, but he's already been through a lot.\n\nLegally, if the child isn't his, he's not responsible for child support unless he has legal ties. Emotionally, he's dealing with betrayal and loss. However, some might argue that he should still support her because she's pregnant, regardless of the cheating. Others would say he's justified in not wanting to be part of someone else's child's life, especially after cheating.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. From a legal standpoint, he's not. From an emotional perspective, it's complex. He's allowed to prioritize his own well-being. But maybe there's a social expectation to help, even if it's not legally required. But if he didn't know about the cheating before the paternity test, and now he's confirmed it, he's not obligated to help. The woman is still pregnant, but the father is someone else. The author's friends are saying he should help, but that's their opinion. He's making a personal choice here, which is valid. So, the answer is B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
