It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant ex-girlfriend after finding out the child isn't his. \n\nFirst, the situation: They were in a 2-year relationship. The ex lost her job, the author suspected cheating, and he broke up with her. She left to stay with her parents. Then she comes back saying she's pregnant. He lets her stay with the condition of a paternity test. The test comes back negative, and he kicks her out. Now, people are telling him he's wrong for not helping.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author allowed her to stay under the assumption he was the father. Once that's proven false, he feels no obligation anymore. But the ex is now pregnant, and the baby is not his. The author is being criticized for not supporting her and the child despite the betrayal.\n\nLegally, paternity is established through a court, but since he's not the biological father, he's not legally obligated to support the child. However, there might be moral considerations. The author is in a vulnerable emotional state, having been cheated on and financially supporting her previously. He's not in a position to take on the responsibility of a child he's not related to. \n\nOn the other hand, the ex is pregnant and in a difficult situation, with parents who smoke, which is unhealthy. The author's home was supposed to be a safer place. Now that he's not the father, he's cutting ties. But some might argue that he should still help because the child is vulnerable. However, he's not the parent, so the responsibility isn't his. \n\nEmotionally, the author is going through a lot. The cheating was confirmed, which adds to his distress. The mutual friends are pressuring him, but their arguments might not consider his personal experience. The author's decision is based on the paternity test results, which changed the dynamics of the situation. \n\nIs he wrong? Well, if the child isn't his, he's not legally or morally bound to care for them. The ex made him think the child was his, and when that's proven false, the arrangement changes. However, some might say he should still help because she's in a bad situation. But his own emotional and financial state is a factor. He's not the parent, so maybe it's not his responsibility. \n\nThe answer likely depends on personal morals. Legally, he's not in the wrong. Morally, it's debatable, but the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since the child isn't his, and he had a right to know, he's not obligated. So the answer might be B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
