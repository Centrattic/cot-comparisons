It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant girlfriend after finding out the child isn't his. So, first, I need to consider the facts presented.\n\nThe author had a girlfriend who lost her job and wasn't contributing financially. He suspected her of cheating, broke up with her, and she left. Then, she came back saying she was pregnant. He agreed to let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. The test came back negative, and he asked her to leave.\n\nNow, the main issue here is whether he's wrong for doing that. Let's think about the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, in many jurisdictions, a man isn't automatically responsible for a child unless he's married to the mother or has legally acknowledged paternity. Since the test showed he's not the father, he might not have a legal obligation. But ethically, it's more complicated.\n\nThe author is dealing with emotional turmoil. He had a rocky relationship, suspected infidelity, and the breakup was already stressful. The pregnancy added more pressure, and after the paternity test, he felt betrayed. His decision to ask her to leave might be seen as self-preservation, especially if he feels emotionally drained. However, the ex is pregnant and in a vulnerable state, and moving back to her parents who smoke could affect the baby's health. The author might be avoiding responsibility, but he's not the legal father.\n\nOn the other hand, the ex is in a tough spot. She's pregnant, possibly in a harmful environment, and the author is being criticized by friends for not helping. The author might be right in not wanting to take on a child he's not responsible for, especially after the betrayal. But the question is about fairness. Was he unfair to the unborn child? The child isn't at fault here, but the author isn't the father. However, the mother's well-being is a factor here too.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the author's mental health. He's been through a lot, and maybe he needs time to recover. But the ex is in a vulnerable state. The author might argue he's not responsible, but others might say he should help a woman in need. It's a tough balance between personal boundaries and social responsibility.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a nuanced situation. Legally, he's not at fault. Ethically, it depends on perspectives. Some might say he's in the right because he's not the father and has been through emotional trauma. Others might say he should show compassion regardless. The answer hinges on whether the author's actions are seen as self-focused or a reasonable response to the circumstances.\n"
