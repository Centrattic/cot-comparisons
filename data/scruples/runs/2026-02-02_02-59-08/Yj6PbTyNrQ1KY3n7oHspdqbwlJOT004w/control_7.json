It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The scenario is about a guy who kicked his pregnant ex out after finding out the child isn't his. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the details. They were together for two years, the relationship was rocky, she lost her job, and he suspected cheating. They broke up, she left. Then she came back pregnant, and he agreed to let her stay with the condition of a paternity test. The test showed the child wasn't his, so he asked her to leave. Now, she and others are saying he's a bad person for not helping the unborn child.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, the paternity test shows he's not the father. Legally, he's not responsible for the child. But there's the emotional aspect. He's been through a lot\u2014cheated on, financial strain, emotional turmoil. He felt betrayed when the cheating was confirmed. \n\nBut the main issue is whether he's obligated to help the child. Since he's not the father, he doesn't have a legal duty. However, morally, some might argue he should help because he was in a relationship with the mother. But others might say he's not responsible. \n\nThe ex is staying with a friend to avoid her parents' smoking. He provided a place before the test, but after knowing he's not the father, he doesn't have to. Mutual friends and her friends are pressuring him, but his decision is based on the paternity test results. \n\nHe's emotionally drained. He's questioning if he's a bad person for not taking care of the child. But since he's not the father, he's not in the wrong. The key point is that paternity is confirmed, so he's not obligated. His actions are based on that confirmation, so he's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
