It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for kicking his pregnant girlfriend out after discovering the child isn't his. Let me break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the ex and the author were together for two years, but the relationship was rocky. The ex lost her job and wasn't looking for work, so the author was financially supporting them. He suspected cheating and eventually broke up, and she went to live with her parents. Then she came back pregnant, and he let her stay, agreeing to a paternity test. The test showed the child isn't his, so he told her to leave. Now, people are telling him he's being unfair, but he's feeling conflicted.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author initially supported her and agreed to the test out of good faith. But when the result came back negative, he decided to cut ties. The question is whether that's wrong.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the child isn't his, he doesn't have a legal obligation to support it. But ethically, it's more complicated. The author might feel he's being used or betrayed. The ex cheated, which adds another layer. However, the child is innocent. But the author isn't the father, so is he responsible?\n\nSome might argue that once he got involved, he took on a certain responsibility, even if he later found out he wasn't the father. Others might say he's not obligated to care for someone else's child, especially after the betrayal. The ex's cheating is a significant factor here. If she cheated, that's a betrayal of trust. Also, she had previously left him and was living with her parents, so maybe he didn't have to take her in again.\n\nBut then, when she came back, he allowed her to stay under the condition of a paternity test. He trusted her then. Now that the test shows the child isn't his, he's cutting her off. The ex might be taking advantage, but the child is still affected. However, the author isn't the father, so he's not legally or morally bound to support the child. The emotional toll on the author is also a factor here\u2014he's been through a lot, and this adds to his stress.\n\nOn the other hand, some might say that by allowing her to stay and agreeing to the test, he created an expectation of support. But once the test results came in, that expectation is nullified. The author's decision to leave is based on the discovery of the infidelity and the lack of paternity. It's a personal decision, and he has the right to prioritize his own well-being, especially after being betrayed.\n\nSo weighing all these factors, the author isn't in the wrong. He's making a choice based on the information he has, and the responsibility for supporting another's child isn't his. The key point is the absence of a biological connection and the prior infidelity, which justifies his decision to seek space and not take on someone else's parental responsibilities. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
