It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for kicking out his pregnant girlfriend after finding out the child isn't his. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author and his ex had a rocky relationship, especially after she lost her job and wasn't contributing financially. He suspected cheating, broke up, she left. Then she came back pregnant and they agreed on a paternity test. The test showed the child isn't his, so he asked her to leave again. Now he's getting messages from friends and the ex's side saying he's being a bad person for not taking care of the child.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to evaluate both sides. Legally, since the child isn't his, he isn't obligated to support it. Emotionally, he's been through a lot, betrayal, cheating, and the paternity test confirmed the child isn't his. That's a huge emotional hit. But there's a human element here too\u2014there's an unborn child involved. Even though he's not the father, denying shelter could affect the mother's well-being. However, the mother was the one who came back to stay with him, and he had conditions. Once the paternity test came back negative, he felt the arrangement was no longer valid.\n\nMorally, it's tricky. He might feel he's not responsible, but others argue he should help regardless. But he didn't have a legal obligation. Also, he was in a vulnerable emotional state. The ex was cheating, and he's dealing with the fallout. He might be justified in wanting to protect himself from further emotional harm.\n\nBut on the flip side, the unborn child is innocent. Even if he's not the father, turning them away could leave them in a difficult situation. However, the mother can seek other support. The author's house was a temporary arrangement based on mutual agreement. Once that agreement's condition (paternity test) was met, he's not bound to continue the arrangement. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He followed through on the agreement. The paternity test was the deal-breaker. He's under no obligation to support someone else's child. His emotional state is valid, and he's making a choice based on his own circumstances. While others might argue for compassion, his actions were within his rights given the terms they set. So the answer would be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
