I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for dissuading a mother from buying GTA V for her 9-year-old. \n\nFirst, GTA V is rated M for Mature, which is for ages 17+. The author provided detailed info about the game's content like torture scenes, sexual themes, and swearing. The mother was concerned and chose a different game. The co-worker criticized the author for \"cockblocking,\" but others had mixed reactions.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they were acting in the best interest of the child, providing necessary information so the parent could make an informed decision. They compared it to how they would want someone to inform them if they were buying a game for their own kids. \n\nLegally and ethically, there's no law against sharing truthful information about a product. The author isn't forcing the sale but giving facts. The mother made the choice based on that info. The co-worker's issue seems to be with the author's method, but the author's intent was to protect the child from inappropriate content. \n\nIn most cases, people support protecting children from content unsuitable for their age. The author didn't overstep by sharing accurate details relevant to the purchase decision. The mother appreciated the info and changed her purchase. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
