I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author works at Target in electronics and helped a mother buy a game for her 9-year-old. The game in question is GTA V, which has an M rating. The author explained the content, including graphic torture scenes, sexual themes, swearing, and online aspects. The mother decided not to buy it and chose a different game. The co-worker was upset, saying it was \"videogame cockblocking,\" and the author is now questioning if they were wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was providing information about the game's content as the mother asked for more details. The mother was concerned after the explanation and made a different choice. The author's intention was to inform so the parent could make an educated decision. The M rating is a guideline, and stores often check age for M-rated games. The author might have gone beyond just the rating and gave specific examples, which could be seen as helpful or overstepping, depending on the situation.\n\nIn many places, it's against the law to sell M-rated games to minors under 18, so the author might be following company policy or legal guidelines. However, the co-worker's reaction is that the author was being a \"dick,\" which suggests there's a different view. The key point here is that the mother asked for more information, so the author was responding to her request. The author's reasoning is that they would want the same level of detail if they were buying for their own kids. \n\nPotential issues could be if the author was overemphasizing the content in a way that pressured the mother, but since the mother was the one who asked for more info, it seems consensual. The author didn't force her not to buy it; they provided the facts, and the mother made a choice. Also, GTA V's content is well-documented, so the author wasn't making things up. The co-worker's criticism might stem from thinking the author was overstepping, but the author's action was in the interest of the child's well-being. \n\nLegally and ethically, informing parents about content that could be inappropriate for a child's age is generally considered responsible. The author isn't being malicious; they're trying to help. The mother was appreciative of the information, so the action was helpful. The co-worker's disapproval is subjective, but the author's actions seem justified under the circumstances. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
