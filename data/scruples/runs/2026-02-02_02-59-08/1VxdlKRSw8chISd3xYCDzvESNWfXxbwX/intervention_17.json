I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, working at Target, convinced a mother not to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old son by detailing the graphic content. The co-workers had mixed reactions, with one being upset about \"cockblocking\" the kid.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the ethical angle here. The author's intention was to protect the child from inappropriate content, which is a valid concern. The ESRB rating is M for mature, which typically suggests it's not suitable for under 17. The mother was informed of the content, and she chose not to buy it. So, the author's action led to a positive outcome in terms of child safety.\n\nHowever, the co-worker's criticism is about interfering in a customer's choice. The store employee's role is to provide information, not to make decisions for customers. While the author was honest, going beyond just stating the rating might be overstepping. But the mother asked for more info, so the author answered truthfully.\n\nThe key points here are: Did the author overstep by being overly detailed? The mother was the one asking for more details, so the author was responding appropriately. The co-worker's issue is about not letting the kid get the game, but the employee's duty is to inform, not to enforce. The author's reasoning is that they were doing what they would want for their own kids, which is a common stance in such cases.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They provided necessary information that helped the mother make an informed decision. The co-worker's frustration is more about not wanting to interfere, but the author's actions were in line with protecting a child from inappropriate content. So the answer should be B.\n"
