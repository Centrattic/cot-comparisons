I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author working at Target and advising a mother not to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old son due to the game's mature content. The co-worker was upset, and the author is now questioning if they made the right decision.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author provided detailed information about the game's content, including graphic elements, which led the mother to choose a different game. The mother initially didn't know much about the game, so the author's input was likely helpful. The author's reasoning is that if they were in the mother's position, they would want to know about such content to make an informed decision.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). From a moral standpoint, the author is acting in what they perceive as the best interest of the child. The game is rated M for Mature, which typically indicates it's not suitable for children under 17. By informing the mother, the author is adhering to the rating system and possibly preventing the child from being exposed to inappropriate content. However, there might be a counterargument that the author overstepped their role as a salesperson, assuming the authority to make a decision for the customer. But in reality, salespeople often provide information to help customers make informed choices, especially regarding content ratings. The mother was the one who made the final decision after being informed. The co-worker's criticism might stem from thinking the author was too direct, but the mother's concern and subsequent decision suggest the information was necessary. The author's action aligns with ethical responsibility to warn about content that could be harmful or unsuitable for a child's age. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
