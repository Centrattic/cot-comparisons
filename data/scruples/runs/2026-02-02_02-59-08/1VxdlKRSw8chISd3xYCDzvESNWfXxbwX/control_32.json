  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for detailing the more graphic scenes in GTAV to persuade parents not to buy GTAV for kids under 16-18?\nI've worked for Target for about a year now, and I just transferred to a new store. I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. They were working at Target, helped a mom who wanted to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old, explained the mature content, and convinced her not to buy it. Then a coworker criticized them for \"cockblocking\" the kid.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The mom was buying a game for a young child. GTA V has an M rating, which is for mature audiences. The employee explained the graphic content, which led the mom to choose a different game. The employee's intention was to provide accurate information so the parent could make an informed decision. That seems responsible. However, the coworker thought it was a \"dick move,\" implying maybe the employee overstepped.\n\nBut the employee's reasoning is that they would want the same if they were in the parent's position. They were following the parent's request for more information. The parent wasn't forced; she made the decision based on the info. The employee didn't prevent the sale but provided facts. The parent is the one who decides the appropriateness. So the employee is acting as a responsible employee, doing their job to inform the customer. The coworker's criticism is about not letting the kid have the game, but the employee's role is to inform, not to judge. Therefore, the employee isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
