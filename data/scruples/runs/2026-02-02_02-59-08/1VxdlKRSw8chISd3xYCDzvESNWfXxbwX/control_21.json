I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong.\n\nSo the situation is that the author works at Target in electronics. A customer, a mom with a 9-year-old son, wants to buy GTA V. The author explains the M rating and gives details about the game's explicit content like torture scenes, sexual themes, swearing, and online aspects. The mom then decides not to buy it and picks another game. However, the co-worker is upset that the author prevented her son from getting the game, and others had mixed reactions. The author is questioned if they were the asshole for doing that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The author's intention was to inform the parent about the content to make an educated decision. The parent didn't know much about the game, so the author provided the necessary information that would help her decide. The fact that the mom then chose not to buy it suggests that the author succeeded in giving her the info she needed. But the co-worker is upset because he thinks the author is interfering with the child's choice or the parent's autonomy.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in many places, selling mature-rated games to minors is regulated, but here the sale didn't happen. The author wasn't the one making the sale; they were a customer service employee. However, the author's actions influenced the parent's decision. There's no law against providing such information, right? The author isn't obligated to do so, but they chose to in the interest of the child's well-being.\n\nMoral perspective: The author believes in the importance of parental awareness and making informed decisions. The co-worker's view is that he was just helping a kid get a game, which is a common debate. The key here is that the author didn't force the mom's hand but provided facts. If the mom had all the info and still wanted to buy it, the author isn't stopping her. But in this case, the mom changed her mind after being informed.\n\nSome might argue that the author overstepped by giving explicit details about the game's content. However, given the M rating and the age of the child (9), it's reasonable to think that the explicit details are necessary for the parent to understand the appropriateness. The author's action aligns with the purpose of content ratings, which are meant to inform parents about the nature of the content.\n\nThe co-workers' mixed reactions are expected; some might see the author as doing a good deed, while others might think it's meddling. But the author's intent was to help the parent, not to be a \"cockblocker.\" The parent ultimately made the decision based on the information given.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because they provided necessary and accurate information to help a parent make an informed choice, which is a responsible action. They didn't force the decision but equipped the parent with knowledge. The co-worker's criticism is more about differing opinions on parental involvement and game content rather than the author being an asshole.\n"
