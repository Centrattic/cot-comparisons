I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted about detailing graphic content in GTA V to a parent is in the wrong. So, the situation is that the author works at Target, helped a mother buy a game for her 9-year-old son. The mother wanted GTA V, which is M-rated. The author explained the M rating, mentioned graphic scenes, torture, sexual content, swearing, and online aspects. The mom decided not to buy it and chose another game instead. Then the coworker criticized the author for \"cockblocking,\" and others had mixed reactions. The author is unsure if they were in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, stores have policies about selling age-rated content to minors. The M rating on games is meant for mature audiences, so selling it to a 9-year-old might be against guidelines. The author informed the parent accurately, which is their responsibility. The parent's decision not to buy the game after being informed suggests that the author did their job correctly by providing necessary information.\n\nHowever, there's a social aspect here. The coworker felt it was a \"dick move,\" possibly because they believed the parent should have the choice without interference. But the author's intention was to protect the child from inappropriate content. The author's reasoning is that they would want the same information for their own kids. That's a valid perspective, emphasizing informed decisions.\n\nAlso, the author didn't prevent the sale but provided facts. The parent made the choice after being informed. The author isn't forcing anyone; they're just sharing the game's content as per ratings. The coworker's criticism might stem from a misunderstanding of the author's intent. The author isn't in the wrong because they followed protocols and acted in what they believe is the child's best interest. There's no indication the author overstepped beyond their role in explaining the game's content. So, the answer should be B (No).\n"
