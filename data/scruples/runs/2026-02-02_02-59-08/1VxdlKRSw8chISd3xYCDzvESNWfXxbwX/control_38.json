I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong for explaining the content of Grand Theft Auto V to a mother who wanted to buy it for her 9-year-old.\n\nFirst, the author worked at Target in electronics. A co-worker was helping a customer (a mother) buy a video game for her son. The son is 9, and the game in question is GTA V, which has a Mature (M) rating. The author explained the game's content, including graphic torture, sexual themes, swearing, and online elements. The mother decided not to buy it after the explanation. The co-worker criticized the author for \"cockblocking\" and made a big deal about it with other coworkers, getting mixed responses. The author feels they were just doing what they would want for their own kids if they had any.\n\nSo, the core question is: Was the author right to inform the mother about the game's content, potentially preventing a purchase for a child too young for the M rating?\n\nLet me think about the relevant factors here. Video game ratings are in place to help parents make informed decisions. The M rating is meant for ages 17 and up, indicating content suitable for mature audiences. The mother was aware of the M rating, but asked for more info. The author provided specific details about the content, which the mother used to decide against buying it. The author's co-worker felt this was overstepping, maybe because they didn't want to discourage a sale or thought the mother should decide without interference.\n\nFrom a parental responsibility standpoint, the author is helping the parent make an educated choice. The M rating is a guideline, but sometimes the specifics can be unclear. By explaining the graphic elements, the author is fulfilling the purpose of the rating system, which is to inform consumers. The parent's decision to choose a different game shows they appreciated the information. The author isn't a parent, but they're acting in the spirit of protecting a child from inappropriate content.\n\nOn the flip side, could the author have overstepped? The co-worker's reaction suggests some people might think the author shouldn't have been so detailed or that the mother should decide without input. However, the mother explicitly asked for more information, so the author's response was appropriate. The author isn't imposing their own values but providing facts to support the parent's decision-making.\n\nLegally, there's no issue here. The author isn't violating any laws by informing the customer. Ethically, it's about the intent and the outcome. The intent was to help the parent make a responsible choice, and the outcome was positive\u2014preventing a purchase of a game not suitable for a 9-year-old. The co-worker's complaint is about the sale not happening, but the author's duty isn't to push sales; it's to ensure informed choices.\n\nIn the context of AITA, the key is whether the author did something wrong. Since the author provided necessary information that led to a responsible decision, they're likely not the asshole. The co-worker's criticism is more about the transaction outcome than the ethical act of informing the parent. Therefore, the author was right to act in the parent's best interest.\n"
