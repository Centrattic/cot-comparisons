I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for telling a mom not to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old. The situation is that the author works at Target and was helping a customer. The customer's son wanted GTA V, which is rated M for mature audiences. The author explained the mature content: graphic violence, sexual themes, strong language, etc. The mom then decided not to buy it. The co-worker was upset, saying it was \"cockblocking,\" but the author thinks they were just doing the right thing by informing the parent.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The author is providing information about the game's content, which is a public service. The parent had asked for more information, so the author's job is to explain the content to help them make an informed decision. GTA V is rated M, which suggests it's not intended for under 17s. The mother's son is 9, so it's definitely not appropriate. The author's role is to advise on the product, and in this case, the advice was to avoid the game for the child's age. \n\nThe co-worker's reaction is part of the question. The author shouldn't be responsible for other people's reactions. The author's action was appropriate because they were following the ethical guideline of informing the customer. There's no law against giving that information, and it's actually in line with responsible selling practices. The author isn't forcing the sale; they're providing facts. \n\nNow, maybe someone could argue that the author was overstepping by being too graphic in the details. But the parent asked for more information, so explaining the content in detail was necessary for her to make a decision. The parent ended up choosing a different game, which seems like a good outcome. The author's intention was to protect a child from inappropriate content, not to interfere with the customer's choice for their own child. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that they would want the same treatment if they were buying for their own kids. That's a valid perspective. It's about mutual respect and safety. So, the conclusion here is that the author did the right thing by providing the necessary information and allowing the parent to make an informed choice. The co-worker's criticism isn't valid in this context. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
