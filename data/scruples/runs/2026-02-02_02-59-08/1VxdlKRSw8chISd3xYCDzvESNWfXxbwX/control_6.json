I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who detailed the graphic content in GTA V to a mother, leading her to not buy the game for her 9-year-old, is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, consider the context. The author works in a store and was helping a customer. The mother was buying a game for her young child. GTA V has an M rating, which is for mature audiences. The author explained the content, including graphic elements, which the mother then decided against purchasing. The co-worker criticized the author for \"cockblocking,\" but the author's intention was to inform the mother to protect the child from inappropriate content.\n\nLegally, there's no law against providing information about a product, even if it's negative. The author wasn't lying or misleading; they were truthful about the game's content. Ethically, protecting children from content unsuitable for their age is generally seen as responsible. The mother might not have known the specifics, so the author's intervention was helpful. However, some might argue that the author overstepped by being too detailed. But given the age of the child and the nature of the game, it's reasonable to prevent access. The co-worker's reaction seems more about not wanting to restrict a child's access, but the author's actions were in line with responsible sales practices. The key points are truthfulness, the child's age, and the intent to protect. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
