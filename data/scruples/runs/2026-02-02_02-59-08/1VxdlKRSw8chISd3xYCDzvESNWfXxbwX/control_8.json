I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the person is asking if they're the asshole for stopping a mother from buying GTA V for her 9-year-old. They gave detailed info about the game's content, which led the mom to choose a different game. The co-worker was upset, but the question is whether the author was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is working at Target, helping a customer. The customer's son is 9, and the game has an M rating. The author explained the mature content, which is part of their job to inform customers about products. The mom was concerned and changed her mind. The author's coworker called it \"cockblocking,\" but the author's intention was to be helpful, as they would want for their own kids.\n\nThe key points here are the age of the child, the M rating's content, and the author's role in providing information. The M rating is for mature audiences, indicating content suitable for those 17+. By explaining the graphic scenes, the author is upholding their responsibility to inform the parent, who might not be fully aware of the game's content. The author isn't forcing the decision but providing necessary info. The co-worker's reaction seems more about not wanting to restrict a child's choice, but the parent's decision is the one that matters here. The author acted as an honest employee, ensuring the parent made an informed choice. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
