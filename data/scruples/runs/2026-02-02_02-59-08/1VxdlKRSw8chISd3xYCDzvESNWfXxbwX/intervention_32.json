I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author, working at Target, advised a mother not to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old son. The co-worker felt it was a \"dick move\" and made a big deal about it. The author is questioning if they were the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author provided information about the game's content, which includes mature themes, violence, swearing, and online interactions. The mother was concerned after the explanation and decided against buying it. The author's intention seems to be to protect the child from inappropriate content, which aligns with their own hypothetical situation as a parent. \n\nBut is there a line that was crossed? The key point is whether the author overstepped their role. As a sales associate, their job is to provide information to the customer. The mother asked for more details, so the author gave her the facts. However, some might argue that the author should have left the decision up to the parents without adding personal judgment. But in this case, the author was transparent about the content, which is in line with the game's M rating. \n\nThe co-worker's reaction might be based on the idea that the salesperson shouldn't influence the purchase decision, but the mother was seeking advice. The author's action could be seen as responsible, especially since the game is rated for older audiences. The mixed response from coworkers suggests it's a subjective issue. \n\nLegally, there might be no issue, but ethically, the author is in a gray area. However, since the mother was informed and made her own choice, the author isn't necessarily wrong. They were providing a service that the customer asked for, helping her make an informed decision. The answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because the salesperson did their job of informing the customer, and the mother used that info to decide. The author didn't force the decision but gave necessary details.\n"
