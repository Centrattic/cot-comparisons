I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the person works at Target in electronics and was helping a mother buy a video game for her 9-year-old son. The mother wanted GTA V, which has an M rating. The employee explained the M rating and the graphic content, including torture scenes, sexual themes, swearing, and online aspects. The mother then decided not to buy GTA V and chose a different game instead. The co-worker was upset about this, calling it \"videogame cockblocking,\" and other coworkers had mixed reactions.\n\nThe author is unsure if they were the asshole for preventing the purchase. The options are A (Yes, in the wrong) or B (No, not in the wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The employee is providing accurate information about the game's content, which is age-inappropriate for a 9-year-old. The M rating is a warning about mature content. The employee is acting in a protective manner, trying to prevent a child from accessing content that's not suitable for their age. This seems like a responsible action, as the employee is helping the parent make an informed decision. \n\nHowever, the co-worker's argument is that it's \"cockblocking,\" implying that the employee overstepped. But the employee was doing their job by providing necessary information. The parent asked for more details after the M rating was mentioned, so the employee was fulfilling their role in customer service by giving them the information they needed. There's no indication that the employee was being rude or coercive; they simply explained the content. \n\nThe key points here are: the employee provided accurate info, the parent made the decision based on that info, and the employee's action aligns with protecting a child's well-being. The co-worker's frustration seems to stem from a different perspective but doesn't override the employee's responsibility. \n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong because they were helping the parent make an informed choice, which is both ethical and appropriate in their role.\n"
