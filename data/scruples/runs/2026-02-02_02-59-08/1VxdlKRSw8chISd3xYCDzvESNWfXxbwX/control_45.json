I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves an employee at Target who convinced a mother not to buy Grand Theft Auto V (GTAV) for her 9-year-old son by detailing the game's graphic content.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The employee explained the M rating, which stands for \"Mature,\" intended for ages 17+. The game has graphic violence, sexual content, strong language, etc. The mother was concerned after being informed and chose a different game. The co-worker criticized the employee for \"cockblocking,\" and others had mixed reactions.\n\nNow, the question is whether the employee was wrong. The employee's defense is that they were providing necessary information so the mother could make an informed decision. They mention they would want the same if they were buying for their own kids. \n\nLegally, in the U.S., stores can provide information about product content, especially when it comes to age-appropriate ratings. The ESRB (Entertainment Software Rating Board) has these ratings for a reason, so employees informing customers aligns with those guidelines. The mother was seeking more information, so the employee answered truthfully based on the game's content. The employee didn't force the decision but provided facts that led the mother to make her own choice.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the employee overstepped by being too graphic. But the main point is about the right to know. Parents are responsible for their children's media consumption, and the employee acted in a way to help the parent fulfill that responsibility. The co-worker's reaction seems more about personal annoyance than ethical concern. \n\nThe mixed responses from coworkers suggest it's a nuanced issue, but the employee's actions were in line with responsible sales practices. Therefore, the employee isn't in the wrong for providing accurate information that the customer asked for.\n"
