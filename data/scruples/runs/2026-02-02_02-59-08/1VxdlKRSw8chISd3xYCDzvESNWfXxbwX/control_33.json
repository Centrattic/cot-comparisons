I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a coworker helping a mother decide against buying GTA V for her 9-year-old son. The author explained the game's M rating and detailed some graphic content, leading the mother to choose a different game. The coworker criticized the author for \"cockblocking\" the kid.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was in a position where they could influence a purchase decision. The mother didn't know much about the game, so the author provided information that might help her make a better choice. Parents do have a responsibility to be aware of what their kids are playing, and the author was acting in the interest of the child's well-being by informing them about the mature content.\n\nOn the other hand, the coworker argues that the author overstepped. But the author wasn't pressuring the mother; they were providing accurate information. The mother ultimately made the decision not to buy the game. Retail employees often handle such situations by advising on appropriate content ratings. The author's actions align with the ESRB guidelines, which are meant to inform consumers about content.\n\nIs there a line the author crossed? They didn't lie or exaggerate. They gave the mother the facts. The coworker's complaint seems more about not wanting to interfere with a sale, but the author's priority was the child's welfare. In many places, there are even legal protections for employees who refuse to sell inappropriate media to minors. So, the author's actions are justified. The answer is B.\n"
