I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AskReddit post is in the wrong for explaining the graphic content in GTA V to a mother, leading her not to buy it for her 9-year-old. The options are A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author works at Target in electronics. A customer (a mother) comes in wanting to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old son. The author explains the M rating and details the graphic content like torture scenes, sexual themes, swearing, and online aspects. The mother then decides against buying it. The co-worker was annoyed, but the author is unsure if they were wrong.\n\nThe key here is whether the author overstepped by providing detailed information. GTA V is rated M for Mature, which is intended for ages 17+. The author provided accurate information about the content, which the mother wasn't aware of. The mother was grateful and chose a different game. \n\nThe author's role in a retail position is to inform customers about products. By explaining the content, the author helped the mother make an informed decision. The ESRB rating is a guideline, but the final decision rests with the parent. The author didn't force the mother to not buy the game; they provided facts. The co-worker's reaction might be based on personal opinion, but the author was acting in the interest of the child's well-being. There's no indication the author was being malicious or incorrect. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They were doing their job by informing the customer, which is what any responsible employee would do. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
