I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author, while working at Target, advised a mother not to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old son because of its mature content. The co-worker was upset about this, and the author is now questioning if they were wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what GTA V's content is like. It's an M-rated game with violence, strong language, sexual themes, etc. So, the author is pointing out the explicit content to a parent buying for a young child. The parent decided not to buy it after being informed. \n\nThe key points here are the age of the child (9 years old) and the game's rating (M for Mature). The M rating is intended for ages 17 and up. The author's action was to inform the parent about the content, which is part of their job, especially in the electronics section where they might be expected to know about products. \n\nThe co-worker is upset because they thought the author was being overbearing, but the author's intention was to prevent the parent from unknowingly buying inappropriate content. The parent was grateful and changed her decision, so the outcome was positive. \n\nIn terms of the author's responsibility, they are not a parent, but they provided factual information about the game. The parent made the final decision. The author isn't in a position to judge the parent's parenting skills, just to relay info. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They did their job by informing the customer, which is what the store might expect. The co-worker's reaction is about personal opinion, but the author's action was ethical and responsible. So the answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
