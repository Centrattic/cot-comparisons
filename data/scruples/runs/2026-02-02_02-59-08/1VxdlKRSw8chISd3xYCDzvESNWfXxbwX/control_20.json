I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, working at Target, helped a mother buy a game for her 9-year-old son. The mother wanted GTA V. The author explained the M rating and gave details about the graphic content. The mother decided not to buy it, and the coworker was upset. The author is now wondering if they were the asshole (AITA).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, stores have policies about selling age-restricted games to minors. The author is working in electronics, so maybe there's a policy about not selling M-rated games to kids under a certain age. If the store's policy allows the sale, but the author is providing information, that's different. However, if the store requires a parent's consent for M-rated games, the author's actions might be in line with that.\n\nNext, the ethical side. The author is protecting a child from inappropriate content. GTA V is known for mature themes like violence, swearing, and sexual content. A 9-year-old is too young for that, so the author is acting as a responsible employee. However, the co-worker is upset because he thought the author was overstepping. But the author's intent was to inform the parent, which is reasonable. The parent made the decision based on the information given.\n\nAlso, the author didn't force the mother to not buy the game; they provided information, and the mother decided. The author is not the parent, but they have a duty to inform. The main issue might be the presentation of the information. If the author was too graphic in the details, maybe that's where the line is crossed. But the mother asked for more info, so the author answered honestly. \n\nIn terms of store policy, if the store allows parents to buy M-rated games for their kids regardless of age, the author might not be in the wrong. If the store has a policy to prevent selling to minors under a certain age without parental consent, but here it's a parent buying for her child, the author might not be violating policy. \n\nThe co-worker's reaction is part of the story. The author is being called an asshole by the co-worker, but the author's action was to help the parent make an informed choice. The parent is the one who made the final decision. The author isn't the parent, but they have a duty to inform. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The author provided necessary information to help the parent make a decision, which is their responsibility. The co-worker's frustration is misplaced because the author was acting ethically and possibly within company policy.\n"
