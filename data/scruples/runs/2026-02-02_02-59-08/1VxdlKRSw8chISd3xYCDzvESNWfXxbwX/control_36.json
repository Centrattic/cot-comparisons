I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a Target employee who convinced a mother not to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old son. The employee detailed the game's graphic content, leading the mother to choose a different game. The co-worker criticized the employee for \"cockblocking,\" and the author is unsure if they were right to do that.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the ethical aspects. The employee provided information about the game's content, which is age-rated M. The mother was seeking advice, so the employee was giving her the facts. The mother then decided not to buy it. The employee's action was based on informing the customer, which is a common practice in retail, especially when it comes to age-appropriate content.\n\nOn the other hand, the co-worker might feel that the employee overstepped by being too graphic in the description, even though the mother asked for more information. However, the mother's concern was valid, and the employee's intention was to help her make an informed decision. The employee didn't force her not to buy it; the mother made the choice herself after being informed.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they were doing what they would want for their own kids. That's a common argument for the \"noble cause\" here. The key points are that the employee provided factual information, the mother was the one who decided against the purchase, and the employee's intent was to help, not to judge or control the customer's choice.\n\nPossible counterarguments could be that the employee shouldn't have given such detailed descriptions, but since the mother asked, it's part of their job to inform. Also, the game is rated M, so the employee is within their role to highlight that. The co-worker's criticism seems to be about the method rather than the intent.\n\nIn most retail settings, employees are encouraged to inform customers about product content, especially for items that have age ratings. The employee isn't in the wrong for doing their job and providing necessary information. The mother appreciated the info and made a choice. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
