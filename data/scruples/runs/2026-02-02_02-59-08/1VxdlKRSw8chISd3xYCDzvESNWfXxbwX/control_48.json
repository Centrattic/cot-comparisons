I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author works at Target, in electronics. They helped a customer buy a video game for her 9-year-old son. The mom wanted to get GTA V, which has an M rating (for mature audiences). The author explained the M rating and gave more details about the content\u2014graphic torture scenes, sexual themes, intense swearing, and the online aspect. The mom was concerned and decided not to buy it, choosing another game instead. Then the co-worker complained that the author was \"cockblocking\" her son, and other coworkers had mixed reactions. The author is questioning if they're the asshole for stopping the sale.\n\nSo the question is: Is the author in the wrong (A) or not (B)? \n\nFirst, I should consider the role of a salesperson. Their job is to assist customers and provide accurate information about products. The mother asked for more information, and the author gave her the details about the content. The M rating is there for a reason, indicating that the game is not suitable for children. The author is informing the customer about the game's content, which is a responsible action. The mother then made an informed decision not to buy it, which aligns with protecting her child from inappropriate content.\n\nHowever, the co-worker is upset because the son wanted the game. The argument here is whether the salesperson overstepped by giving too much detail. But the author didn't force the sale; they provided necessary information. The mother had the final say. The author's intention was to help the customer make a responsible choice, which is a positive action. The co-worker's frustration seems misplaced because the salesperson is just doing their job by informing the customer of the product's content. \n\nAlso, the author's reasoning is that they would want the same for their own kids if they had them. It's about protecting children from inappropriate content. The key points here are the M rating, the responsibility of the salesperson to inform, and the parent's decision-making. There's no indication that the author gave false information or tried to interfere without a valid reason. The details provided are factual, and the outcome was the parent choosing a different game, which is the intended purpose of the M rating system.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because they were providing necessary information for the customer to make an informed decision. The co-worker's complaint is about the son not getting the game, but the salesperson isn't responsible for the child's desires. The parent's consent and informed choice are paramount here. Therefore, the answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
