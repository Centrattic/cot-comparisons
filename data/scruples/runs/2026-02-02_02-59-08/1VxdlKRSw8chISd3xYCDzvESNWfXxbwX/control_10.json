I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AskAdvice post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author worked at Target and helped a mother buy a video game for her 9-year-old son. The mother wanted Grand Theft Auto V (GTAV), which has an M rating. The author explained the game's content, including graphic scenes, sexual themes, swearing, and the online component. The mother then decided not to buy GTAV and chose another game instead. However, the co-worker felt that the author was being a \"dick\" for \"cockblocking\" the kid, and there was mixed reaction among other coworkers.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author was in the wrong. The key points here are the author's intention to inform the parent about the content of the game to help her make an informed decision. The mother was seeking more information, so the author provided the necessary details. The M rating is meant for mature audiences, so the author was likely just explaining the rating accurately. The co-worker's objection is about the author interfering with the child's wish, but the author's role is to provide information, not to make the decision. The mother used that information to decide against the purchase, which seems reasonable given the content for a 9-year-old. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that they were doing what they would expect if they were buying a game for their own kids. That's a common perspective\u2014acting in the interest of the child's well-being by ensuring parents know what they're letting their kids into. The game's content, as described, includes elements that are inappropriate for younger children. The author didn't prevent the sale outright but provided information that led the parent to make a choice. There's no indication that the author overstepped or acted in a malicious way; they were fulfilling their role as an employee who knows the product's content and the rating system.\n\nThe co-worker's criticism might stem from a belief that the child should get what they want regardless of the content, but that's a different viewpoint. The author's actions were within their job responsibilities to inform the customer accurately. The mother was the one making the purchase, so the author isn't imposing their own values but giving facts. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong because they were providing necessary information that helped the parent make a responsible decision. The answer should be B (No).\n"
