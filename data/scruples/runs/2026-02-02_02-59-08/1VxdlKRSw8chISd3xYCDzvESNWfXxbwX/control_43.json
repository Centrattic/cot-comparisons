I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong.\n\nThe scenario is that the person works at Target in electronics and convinced a mother not to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old son because of the game's mature content. The mother decided against it after being informed. The co-worker was upset, but the author feels they were just telling the truth about the game's content.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author provided accurate information about the game's rating and content. The mother was given the information to make an informed decision. The author didn't lie or exaggerate; they were honest about the M rating and specific content like torture scenes, sexual themes, and swearing. The mother decided against the purchase, which seems responsible. \n\nThe co-worker's reaction seems to be about not wanting to interfere, but the author's action was about providing necessary info. As a parent, one would want to know such details. There's no law against sharing that info, and it's part of the job to inform customers about product content. So the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
