I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for informing a mother about the graphic content in GTA V to prevent her from buying it for her 9-year-old. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author works at Target in electronics and was helping a customer buy a video game. The customer's son is 9, and she wanted GTA V. The author explained the M rating, mentioned graphic scenes like torture, sexual content, swearing, and the online aspect. The mother decided not to buy it after the explanation. The co-worker criticized the author for \"cockblocking\" the kid, but others had mixed reactions. The author is unsure if they were the asshole.\n\nThe core issue is whether the author overstepped by providing such detailed information. The author's defense is that they were doing what they would want if they had kids and were buying a game without knowing the content. The mother might not have been aware of the specific content beyond the M rating. \n\nIn many places, there are laws that require retailers to provide content information, especially for minors. For example, in California, there's a law that allows stores to refuse a sale if they believe the content is inappropriate for the child. So, the author might be acting within legal guidelines. \n\nHowever, there's a line between providing necessary information and imposing personal moral standards. The author didn't just state the M rating but added graphic details about the torture and sexual content. The question is whether those details were necessary or if they were just expressing the author's own opinion. If the author was merely explaining the content to help the mother make an informed decision, then it's justified. But if they went beyond the facts to persuade the mother based on personal beliefs, that might be crossing a line.\n\nThe mother's decision to buy a different game suggests that the information was useful. The author's intention was protective, which is a common parental concern. The co-worker's complaint seems to be more about the author interfering with the child's choice, but the parent has the authority to decide what's appropriate for their child. \n\nIn terms of workplace policy, if there's a rule about not sharing specific content details unless asked, the author might have violated that. But assuming the store allows employees to discuss game content, then the author is within their rights. The key is whether the author was providing factual information as required versus adding personal opinions.\n\nIn summary, the author's actions can be seen as responsible and protective, helping the parent make an informed choice. Unless they provided false information or acted outside their job's guidelines, they aren't in the wrong. The answer would be B (No), but I need to check if there's any nuance I missed.\n"
