I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author works in a store, and when a mother wanted to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old son, the author explained the game's content, leading the mother to choose a different game. The co-worker was upset, but the author is trying to decide if they did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The game is rated M, which is for mature audiences. The author provided information about the content, which includes violence, sexual themes, and swearing. The mother was informed, and she made a decision not to buy it. The author's intention was to help the mother make an informed choice, protecting the child from inappropriate content.\n\nThe key points here are the responsibility of the store employee to inform customers about the content of the products they're purchasing, especially when it comes to age-appropriate material. The author isn't preventing the sale; they're providing information to help the customer make a decision. The mother was given a choice and chose differently. The co-worker's reaction seems to be more about not wanting to \"cockblock\" a sale, but the author's action was in the interest of the child's well-being.\n\nIn many places, there are laws or policies about selling age-restricted content to minors. Even if there's no legal obligation, the ethical stance here is that the employee is doing their job by being honest about the game's content. The author is acting in the mother's best interest, assuming she might not be fully aware of the game's content. The author isn't forcing the mother not to buy it, just informing her. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They provided information, allowing the mother to make an informed decision. The co-worker's criticism isn't valid because the author isn't responsible for the child's access to the game; their role is to be honest about the product. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
