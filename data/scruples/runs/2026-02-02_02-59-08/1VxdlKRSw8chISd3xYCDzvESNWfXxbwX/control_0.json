I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AskReddit post is in the wrong for explaining the graphic content of GTAV to a mother and convincing her not to buy it for her 9-year-old.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author works at Target and was helping a customer. The customer's son is 9, and she wanted to buy GTA V. The author explained the game's M rating and its content, leading her to choose a different game. The co-worker was upset, thinking it was a \"dick move,\" but others had mixed reactions. The author feels they were just doing what they'd want if they were in the customer's shoes.\n\nNow, the key points here: The mother asked for more information after being told about the M rating. The author provided details about the game's content, which the mother found concerning and decided against purchasing. The author's actions were based on informing the parent about the explicit content to help her make an informed decision.\n\nFrom a legal and ethical standpoint, there's nothing illegal about providing factual information about a product. The author isn't forcing the sale but is acting as a responsible employee by informing the customer. The mother had the final decision, and she chose not to buy it after being advised. The argument that the author is in the wrong might come from the co-worker's perspective that the author overstepped, but the author's intention was protective, similar to a parental control or guardian role.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the employee shouldn't interfere in the customer's purchasing decision, even if the customer is a parent. But the mother explicitly asked for more information, so the author's role here is to provide accurate details about the product's content. The author didn't lie or exaggerate; they gave facts that are part of the game's content.\n\nIn many places, there are laws about selling age-inappropriate content to minors. The author's actions align with those laws by ensuring the game isn't given to a child it's rated against. The mother's son is 9, and the game is rated M (17+), so the author is helping prevent a sale that could be against store policy or legal guidelines.\n\nThe co-worker's complaint is about the author interfering, but the author was following proper protocol by informing the customer. The mixed responses from coworkers show that it's a gray area, but the author's intent was to protect the child and help the parent make an informed choice.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They provided necessary information, the parent made an informed decision, and there's no indication of overstepping beyond their role as an employee. The answer should be B (No).\n"
