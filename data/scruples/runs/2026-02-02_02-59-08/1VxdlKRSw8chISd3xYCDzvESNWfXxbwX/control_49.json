I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for convincing a mother not to buy Grand Theft Auto V for her 9-year-old son. The scenario involves the author, who works in a store, providing detailed information about the game's mature content, leading the mother to choose a different game. The co-worker criticized the author for \"cockblocking\" the kid, and the author is now unsure if they did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key factors here. The author's intention was to inform the mother about the game's content, which includes graphic scenes, sexual themes, swearing, and online elements. The mother then decided against buying it for her young son. The author's reasoning is based on wanting to protect the child from inappropriate content and also acting as they would want others to act if they were in a similar situation.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author overstepped their bounds. Retail employees often provide information about products, especially when it comes to age-appropriate content. The game has an M (Mature) rating, which is a clear indicator, but the mother asked for more details. The author went into specifics about the content, which led the mother to make an informed decision. \n\nFrom a legal and ethical standpoint, the author isn't obligated to give such detailed information, but they are within their rights to do so if a customer asks. The mother was the one making the purchase decision, and the author's role was to facilitate her choice with accurate information. The co-worker's criticism seems more about the child wanting the game than the author's duty to inform.\n\nPotential arguments against the author might be that they assumed the mother couldn't make the decision herself or that they judged the mother's choice. However, the mother explicitly asked for more information, so the author's response was a direct answer to her inquiry. The author didn't force the decision but provided the facts, allowing the mother to decide. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, there's a general expectation that retailers will provide necessary information to help customers make informed choices, especially regarding content that could affect children. The author acted in a way that aligns with this expectation. The co-worker's reaction suggests a different viewpoint, possibly valuing the child's desires over the content's appropriateness, but the author's stance is more about protecting the child.\n\nConsidering all these points, the author's actions were appropriate. They provided necessary information in response to the mother's request, leading to an informed decision. There's no indication of overstepping beyond giving factual content details. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
