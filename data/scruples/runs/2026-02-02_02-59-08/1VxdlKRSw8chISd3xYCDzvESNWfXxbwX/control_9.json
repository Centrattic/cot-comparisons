I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the given story is in the wrong. The situation involves a Target employee who convinced a mother not to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old son by detailing the graphic content. The co-worker was upset about it, and the author is unsure if they were at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the role of a retail employee in such scenarios. Employees often provide information about product content, especially when it comes to age-appropriate content. The game has an M rating, which is for mature audiences, and the employee explained the reasons behind that rating. The mother was concerned after learning about the graphic content and chose a different game. \n\nThe key points here are the employee's intent and their actions. The employee's intention was to inform the parent so they could make an educated decision. The mother was the one making the purchase, and the employee didn't prevent the sale but provided necessary details. The co-worker's complaint was about \"cockblocking,\" which seems more about the employee interfering with the sale rather than a genuine concern for the child's well-being. \n\nLegally and ethically, it's standard practice to inform customers about content warnings, especially when a child is involved. The ESRB ratings exist for this reason\u2014to guide parents. The employee acted in good faith, respecting the rating system and the parent's right to know. The co-worker's reaction might stem from a different perspective, perhaps prioritizing sales over content warnings, which isn't necessarily the right approach when it comes to protecting minors.\n\nSo, considering all this, the employee isn't in the wrong. They provided accurate information that helped the parent make a responsible choice. The answer should be B (No).\n"
