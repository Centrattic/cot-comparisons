I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is working at Target and helped a mother decide against buying GTA V for her 9-year-old. They gave detailed info about the game's mature content. The co-worker thought they were being a jerk, but the author feels they were just helping the mom make an informed decision.\n\nFirst, GTA V is rated M for Mature, which is for 17 and up. The mother was buying for a 9-year-old, so the author is pointing out that the content isn't suitable. Legally, stores can refuse to sell M-rated games to minors, but here the author didn't refuse the sale\u2014they just advised against it. \n\nThe author provided accurate information about the game's content, which is their responsibility. The mother appreciated the info and chose a different game. The co-worker's reaction might be because they wanted the sale to happen, but the author's intent was to protect the child's well-being. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author is acting in the best interest of the child. The ESRB ratings exist for a reason, and informing parents about content that might be inappropriate is a valid action. The author isn't forcing the mother's hand but giving her the facts so she can decide. \n\nThe co-worker's complaint seems more about wanting to make a sale rather than considering the child's welfare. The author isn't in the wrong here because they followed ethical guidelines and provided necessary information. So, the answer should be B.\n"
