I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author works at Target in electronics and helped a mother buy a video game for her 9-year-old son. The mother wanted to buy Grand Theft Auto V (GTAV), which has a Mature rating. The author explained the game's content, including graphic torture scenes, sexual themes, and strong language. As a result, the mother decided not to buy it. However, the co-worker criticized the author for \"cockblocking\" the kid, and others had mixed reactions.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author did the right thing. Let me break it down. The author's main argument is that they were informing the mother about the game's content, which is appropriate since the mother was seeking more information. The mother was concerned after learning about the content and changed her purchase. The co-worker's reaction is that it was a \"dick move,\" but others in the break room had mixed responses.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspect. The author was providing factual information about the game's content, which is part of their job to help customers make informed decisions. The mother asked for more details, so the author gave them. The author's intention was to ensure the mother knew what she was buying, especially since the game is rated for older audiences. The mother then made a responsible decision not to buy it for a 9-year-old, which aligns with the game's rating.\n\nOn the other hand, the co-worker's criticism suggests that maybe the author overstepped. But the author didn't force the mother not to buy the game; they just provided information. The mother had the autonomy to decide based on that info. The co-worker might feel that the author is being overly judgmental, but the author's action was in line with their responsibility to inform customers.\n\nAnother angle is the ESRB ratings. GTAV is M-rated, meaning it's for ages 17+. By explaining the content, the author is helping enforce the rating system. The mother might not have been aware of the specifics, so the author's intervention could be seen as a protective measure for the child's welfare. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author could have been more diplomatic. Maybe they could have suggested age-appropriate alternatives instead of detailing the graphic content. But the author did mention the M rating first and then elaborated on the content because the mother asked. It's possible that the mother wanted to know specifics to make an informed choice.\n\nThe co-worker's reaction seems to be more about the kid not getting the game he wanted rather than any harm done. The author isn't in the wrong for preventing a purchase that, if made, could expose a child to inappropriate content. The author's action is in line with responsible consumer advice and child protection.\n\nIn terms of legal or company policy, the author isn't violating any rules by informing the customer. They're performing their job by providing accurate information about the product. There's no indication that the author pressured or coerced the mother; they simply shared the facts as requested.\n\nThe key here is the mother's decision-making process. She was given the necessary information and chose to act in her child's best interest. The author's role here is to assist the mother, not to make the decision for her. But providing the information is part of their job, not being in the wrong. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the author isn't in the wrong. They acted responsibly by informing the mother, helping her make an informed decision, and preventing a potentially inappropriate purchase. The co-worker's criticism doesn't hold weight because the author didn't do anything unethical or against their job role.\n"
