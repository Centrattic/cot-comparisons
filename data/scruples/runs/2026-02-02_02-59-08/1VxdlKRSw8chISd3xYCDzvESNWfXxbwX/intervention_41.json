I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, working at Target in electronics, helped a mother buy a game for her 9-year-old son. The mother wanted Grand Theft Auto V (GTAV), which is rated M (Mature). The author explained the content, including graphic scenes, sexual themes, swearing, and the online aspect. After this, the mother changed her mind and bought a different game. The co-worker criticized the author for \"cockblocking\" and made a big deal about it, with mixed reactions.\n\nThe author is wondering if they were wrong to dissuade the mother from buying GTAV. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but is curious for another opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author provided information about the game's content, which is rated M. The mother was seeking information before making a purchase. The author's intention was to inform her so she could make an educated decision, which aligns with the idea that the M rating is a guideline. However, the co-worker felt it was a \"dick move,\" suggesting the author overstepped.\n\nIn the U.S., the ESRB ratings are meant to guide parents, but they aren't legally binding. As a salesperson, the author's role is to provide information upon request. The mother asked for more details, so the author gave them. The author didn't prevent the sale; the mother chose not to buy it after being informed. The author's action could be seen as responsible, as they're helping parents make appropriate choices for their children.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author shouldn't have influenced the mother's decision beyond providing the facts, or that they went beyond the rating by adding personal opinions about the content's appropriateness. But in this case, the author was explaining the content as per the rating, which is part of the ESRB's description. If the mother wanted to know more, the author's job is to inform her. The author isn't forcing her not to buy it, just giving her the information to decide.\n\nThe co-worker's criticism seems based on the idea that the author is being a \"dick\" by interfering, but the author's intention was to protect the child from inappropriate content. The mixed reactions from coworkers indicate it's a subjective issue. However, the author is in a position to provide necessary information, and parents expect that when purchasing for their kids. The author's action is in line with protecting children from unsuitable content, which is a common concern.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They provided necessary information, which the mother used to make a decision. The co-worker's reaction is more about the author's interference, but the author's role is to inform, not to make the decision for the customer. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
