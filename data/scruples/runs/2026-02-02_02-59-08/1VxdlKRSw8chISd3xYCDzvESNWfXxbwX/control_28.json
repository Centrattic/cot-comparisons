I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the GTA V situation is in the wrong. So, first, I need to understand the scenario.\n\nThe author works at Target in electronics. A customer came in to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old son. The author explained the M rating, mentioning graphic content like torture scenes, sexual themes, swearing, and the online aspect. The mother decided not to buy it and got a different game instead. Then the coworker complained about \"cockblocking\" and made a big deal in the break room. The author is now wondering if they're the asshole.\n\nNow, the key points here are: the store employee's duty to inform customers about product content, the appropriateness of the game for a 9-year-old, and whether the author overstepped.\n\nIn many places, stores have policies where employees can refuse a sale if they believe the product isn't age-appropriate. Also, the ESRB ratings are there for a reason. The M rating is for mature audiences, so the author was pointing out the content as per the rating. The author didn't force the sale but provided accurate information. The mother was the one who made the decision, not the author. The coworker's issue seems to be about not wanting to deny a kid a game, but the author's concern was about the content being unsuitable.\n\nSo, in terms of responsibility, the employee is within their rights to inform the customer. The mother was given the facts and chose not to buy it. The coworker's complaint is more about the kid wanting the game, but the author wasn't wrong in providing necessary info. The author wasn't being judgmental beyond the facts, just doing their job to help the customer make an informed decision. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
