I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about an employee at Target who advised a mother not to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old son due to the game's mature content. The co-worker was upset, calling it \"cockblocking,\" but others had mixed reactions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The employee provided information about the game's M rating, graphic scenes, and other inappropriate content. The mother was concerned and decided to buy a different game. The co-worker felt the employee overstepped, but the employee's reasoning was that they were informing the mother to make a responsible decision.\n\nThe main question is whether the employee did the right thing. According to the store's policies, employees are usually trained to provide information about game ratings and content to customers. The ESRB ratings are meant to guide parents, so the employee was following that guidance. The employee didn't force the mother not to buy the game but informed her, which is part of the job. The co-worker's reaction seems to be more about disagreeing with the decision rather than the employee violating any rules. The employee's intention was to help the parent make an informed choice, which is a responsible action. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
