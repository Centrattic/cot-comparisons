I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a Target employee who convinced a mother not to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old son by detailing the game's graphic content. The employee is now questioning if they were the asshole (AITA).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The employee provided detailed information about the game's content, which led the mother to choose a different game. The co-worker criticized the employee for \"cockblocking,\" but others had mixed reactions. The employee's main argument is that they were giving the mother the information she needed to make an informed decision, similar to how they would want for their own kids.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. The employee's role in a retail setting includes providing accurate information about products, including content ratings and what the game entails. The mother asked for more information, so the employee was fulfilling their job responsibly by explaining the M rating and specific content. The parent then made the decision based on that info. The employee didn't force her to not buy it; they just gave more context. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the employee overstepped by being too graphic in their description. However, since the mother explicitly asked for more details and the game does contain mature content, it's part of the employee's responsibility to inform her. The parent is the one who ultimately decided not to buy it, so the employee isn't forcing their opinion but providing necessary info to help the parent decide.\n\nAlso, the mother might not have been aware of the specific content in GTA V. By explaining the graphic scenes, the employee is helping her make an informed choice, which aligns with responsible parenting and retail ethics. The co-worker's criticism seems to stem from a different perspective, possibly valuing the child's wishes over the content concerns, but the employee's action was in line with protecting the child's appropriate exposure.\n\nSo, considering all this, the employee isn't in the wrong. They provided necessary information as part of their job, and the parent made the decision based on that. The answer should be B (No).\n"
