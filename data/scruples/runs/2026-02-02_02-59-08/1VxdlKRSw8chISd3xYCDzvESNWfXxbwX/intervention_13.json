I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for explaining the graphic content of GTA V to a mother buying it for her 9-year-old.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author works at Target and was helping a customer. The mother wanted GTA V for her 9-year-old. The author explained the M rating, mentioned graphic scenes, sexual themes, swearing, and online aspects. The mother decided not to buy it. The co-worker criticized the author for \"cockblocking,\" but the author thought they were just informing the parent.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The author's intention was to provide accurate information about the game's content so the parent could make an informed decision. The mother was seeking more info, so the author answered truthfully. By doing so, they helped the parent avoid a purchase that might not be age-appropriate. \n\nThe co-worker's reaction is about the author interfering, but the author wasn't preventing a sale out of spite; they were protecting a child from potentially inappropriate content. The author's reasoning is that any parent would appreciate knowing the details to make a good choice for their kids. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, employees are often expected to explain product content accurately. GTA V is rated M for mature audiences, which includes explicit content. By informing the parent, the author is acting in line with ethical guidelines, possibly even company policy, to provide truthful information. \n\nThe key point is whether the author overstepped by giving a detailed description. However, since the mother asked for more information, the author was within their right to answer honestly. The co-worker's criticism is more about the outcome (not making the sale) rather than the method. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Their action was a responsible act to inform a parent about content that could be unsuitable for a young child. The co-worker's complaint is misplaced because the author was assisting the customer with accurate information.\n"
