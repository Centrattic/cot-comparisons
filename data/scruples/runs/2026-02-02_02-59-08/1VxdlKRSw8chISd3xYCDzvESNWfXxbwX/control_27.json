I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author works at Target and convinced a mother not to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old son. The co-worker was upset, and the author is questioning if they were the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The mother wanted to buy a game for her 9-year-old, but GTA V has an M rating, which is for mature audiences. The author explained the content, including graphic torture, sexual themes, swearing, and online aspects. The mother then decided against it. The co-worker felt it was \"cockblocking\" and made a big deal about it, but the author's intention was to inform the parent, similar to how they would want someone to inform them if they were in the same situation.\n\nNow, thinking about this, the main ethical issue is whether the author overstepped their role as an employee. Their responsibility is to provide information about the product. The mother asked for more details, and the author gave the necessary information about the content. The author didn't force the mother to not buy it; they just shared the facts. The author's actions led to the mother making an informed decision, which seems responsible. The co-worker's reaction might be due to feeling that the author interfered, but the mother's primary concern is the child's well-being. \n\nIn many places, there are laws about selling mature-rated games to minors, so the store has a responsibility to prevent such sales. The author, by informing the mother, might be abiding by those policies, even if the mother wasn't the one buying it for herself. The author's intention was to protect the child from inappropriate content, which is a common parental concern. The mixed reactions from coworkers don't necessarily indicate that the author was wrong; it's possible some coworkers didn't see the issue with the content. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because they provided necessary information to help the parent make a decision, which is part of their job in electronics. The mother made the decision based on that info, which is her right. The co-worker's frustration doesn't negate the author's correct action.\n"
