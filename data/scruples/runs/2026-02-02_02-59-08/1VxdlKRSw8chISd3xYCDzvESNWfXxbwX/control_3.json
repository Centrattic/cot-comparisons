I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person at Target gave detailed info about GTA V's content to a mother buying it for her 9-year-old. The mom then decided not to buy it. The co-worker thought it was \"cockblocking\" and made a big deal about it.\n\nHmm, the author's reasoning is that they were informing the mother so she could make a good decision. They mention the M rating, graphic content like torture, swearing, etc. The mother was concerned and chose a different game. The co-worker didn't like it but said \"you do you.\" Others had mixed reactions.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the job is to help the customer. But the customer was buying a game for a kid, and the author felt it was their responsibility to provide necessary info. The author's intention was to protect the child from inappropriate content, which is a valid concern. However, some might argue that the author overstepped by being too graphic in the details. But the mother asked for more information, so the author answered truthfully. The mother then made her own decision. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they were being honest and helping the parent make an informed choice. The M rating is there for a reason, and the parent might not know the specifics. The co-worker's reaction is more about personal opinion, but the author's action seems responsible. So answer B.\n"
