I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation is about a Target employee who convinced a mother not to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old, citing the game's mature content. The co-worker was upset, but the author believes they did the right thing by providing information.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The employee was helping a customer, explained the game's content, and the mother decided against buying it. The employee's co-worker and others had mixed reactions. The author's reasoning is that they were giving the mother the information they would want for their own kids.\n\nLooking at the context, the employee isn't in a position of authority to make the decision for the mother. Their job is to provide information, not to enforce content restrictions. However, the mother was asking for more info, so the employee answered honestly. The mother then made her own choice based on that info. The employee didn't say it's inappropriate for under 16-18, but explained the content. The problem here is whether the employee went too far by advising against the purchase, even if they were concerned.\n\nThe main issue is whether the employee overstepped their role. Employees should inform customers about content ratings and what's included in the product. But giving personal opinions or actively discouraging a purchase might be beyond their role. However, the mother was asking for more info, so the employee was just being thorough. The mother made the decision herself, so the employee's actions might be seen as helpful. On the other hand, the co-worker's criticism might stem from the idea that the employee shouldn't interfere with a customer's choice unless there's a policy against selling certain games to minors, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nAlso, the game has an M rating, which is for mature audiences. The mother is aware of that, but the employee provided more details. The employee's action was to inform, not to stop her. The mother chose not to buy it after the explanation. So the employee wasn't wrong in providing the info, but perhaps in the way they presented it. However, the employee's intention was to help the mother make an informed decision, which is a valid role. There's no indication of coercion or policy violation. The co-worker's issue is with the employee's personal opinion affecting the sale, but the mother made the choice herself. \n\nIn conclusion, the employee was within their rights to provide detailed information when asked. They didn't force the mother's decision but gave her the facts. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
