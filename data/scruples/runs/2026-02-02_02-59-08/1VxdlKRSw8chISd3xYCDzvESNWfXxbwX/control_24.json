I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So the user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for convincing a mother not to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old son. The options are A (in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author works at Target in the electronics department. A customer comes in wanting to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old. The author explains the game's M rating, mentions graphic content like torture scenes, sexual themes, swearing, and the online aspect. The mother then decides against buying it. The co-worker was upset, saying it was \"cockblocking,\" but the author feels they were just doing the right thing by informing the mother.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author provided accurate information about the game's content, which led the mother to make an informed decision. The co-worker's reaction is more about disagreeing with the outcome rather than the information given. \n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The author's role is to help customers make informed choices. Video games, especially those with M ratings, are meant for mature audiences. GTA V is known for its mature content, so informing a parent about it seems responsible. The mother asked for more info, and the author gave it, which she used to decide against buying. That seems reasonable. \n\nAre there any laws or company policies that might affect this? In some places, stores can refuse to sell certain content to minors. If the mother was buying for a 9-year-old, the author might even be within their right to refuse the sale based on age restrictions. But the story says the mother was the one purchasing it for her son, so it's not that the author refused the sale, but rather provided info leading her not to buy. \n\nThe co-worker's frustration is about the outcome, not the information. The author isn't in the wrong because they facilitated an informed decision. It's a parental responsibility to know what their kids are exposed to. The author acted in a way that supports that responsibility. \n\nCould there be a downside? Maybe if the author exaggerated, but they mentioned the actual content of the game. Since GTA V's content is well-documented, the author's description is accurate. So, no exaggeration here. \n\nIn conclusion, the author was being helpful and responsible by providing necessary information. The mother used that info to make a choice, which is exactly what the author intended. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
