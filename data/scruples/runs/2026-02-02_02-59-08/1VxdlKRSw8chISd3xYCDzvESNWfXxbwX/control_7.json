I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that the author worked at Target, helped a mother buy a game for her 9-year-old, and convinced her not to get GTA V because of its mature content. The co-worker thought it was \"cockblocking,\" but the author thinks they were just being responsible.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. GTA V has an M rating, which is for mature audiences. The author explained the graphic content, which the mother then decided against. The author's intention was to ensure the mother knew the content to make an informed decision. The mother didn't have the game, so the author provided more details beyond the rating. \n\nIn many places, there are laws about selling age-restricted content to minors. The author is helping enforce that by providing accurate information. The co-worker's issue is more about personal opinion rather than legal or ethical wrongdoing. The author isn't forcing a sale; they're giving information. The mother made the final choice. \n\nThe author's action aligns with protecting a child from inappropriate content. Parents should have all the info to decide. The author isn't in the wrong here because they're acting responsibly, not overstepping. The co-worker's reaction is more about personal freedom versus responsibility. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
