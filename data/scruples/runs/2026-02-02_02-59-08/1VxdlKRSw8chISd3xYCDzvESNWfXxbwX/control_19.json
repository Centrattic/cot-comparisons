I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for advising a mother not to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author works at Target in electronics and was helping a customer. The customer's son is 9, and the game has an M rating, which is for mature audiences. The author provided detailed information about the game's content, including graphic scenes, sexual themes, swearing, and online aspects. The mother then decided against buying it. \n\nThe key points here are the age of the child, the content of the game, and the author's intention. GTA V is rated M for a reason, and the mother was seeking more info. The author's role is to inform customers about the product, especially when the customer is buying for a child. The author didn't force the sale; they gave information and the mother made her own decision. \n\nThe coworker called it \"cockblocking,\" but the author's action was based on concern for the child's appropriateness. The author is advocating for responsible purchasing, which aligns with the ESRB ratings. The mother was grateful for the info, so the author fulfilled their duty to inform.\n\nPossible counterarguments might be that the author overstepped, but given the child's age and the game's content, it's reasonable to question if the mother was aware. The author didn't make a judgment but provided facts. The mother had the final say, so the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
