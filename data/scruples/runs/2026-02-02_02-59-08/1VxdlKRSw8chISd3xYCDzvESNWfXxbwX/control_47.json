I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author worked at Target and convinced a mother not to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old son because of the game's mature content. The co-worker was upset about it, and now the author is questioning if they did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The mother was buying the game for her young child, and the author explained the M rating, including graphic scenes and inappropriate content. The mother ended up buying a different game after being informed. The co-worker and others had mixed reactions, but the author feels they were justified in helping the mother make an informed decision.\n\nThe main ethical question here is whether the author overstepped their role. Employees are usually expected to provide information about products, including content ratings and descriptions. The author didn't force the mother to not buy the game; they simply gave her the facts so she could decide. The mother then chose not to buy it. The author's actions align with helping a customer make an informed choice, which is part of good customer service.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author was being judgmental or interfering in the customer's decision. However, since the customer asked for more information, the author's response was appropriate. The author isn't in the wrong here because they provided necessary details that the customer needed. It's the customer's decision, and the author supported her in making an informed one.\n\nAlso, the author's motivation seems genuine\u2014wanting to protect a child from inappropriate content. The co-worker's frustration is more about not wanting his son to be denied the game, but that doesn't make the author wrong. The author should have the right to share relevant information without being labeled an \"asshole.\"\n\nSo, weighing these factors, the answer is B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong. They provided necessary information to help the mother make a decision about her child's media consumption.\n"
