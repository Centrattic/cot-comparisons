I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about a Target employee who convinced a mother not to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old son by detailing the graphic content. The co-worker complained about it, but the author thinks they were just doing the right thing by informing the parent.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The employee was in a position where a customer was purchasing a game for a child. The game has an M rating, which is for mature audiences. The employee explained the content, including graphic scenes, sexual themes, swearing, and online elements. The mother then decided not to buy it. The co-worker felt it was \"cockblocking\" and made a big deal in the break room.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me think about the ethical aspects. The employee's job is to assist customers, but also to provide accurate information about products. The mother was seeking information, and the employee gave it. The M rating is a guideline, and the employee was explaining why it's not suitable for a 9-year-old. That seems responsible. The employee didn't force her to not buy it; they just provided info, and the mother made the decision. \n\nHowever, the co-worker's reaction might imply that there's an expectation to not discourage sales, but the employee isn't obligated to push a sale. The employee's action was in the best interest of the child's well-being, following the ESRB rating guidelines. The mother was informed, which is important for making an educated choice. \n\nOn the other hand, if the employee had known the mother was a stranger or if there was some other context, maybe it could be different. But in this case, the mother was a customer asking for info, and the employee provided it. The author's reasoning is that if they were in the same situation, they would want the same info for their own kids. That's a solid point. \n\nI don't see the employee overstepping here. They were honest about the game's content, which is part of their job to inform customers. The mother made the choice based on that info. The co-worker's criticism seems like they think the sale should have gone through regardless, but the employee's duty isn't to facilitate the sale at all costs. \n\nSo, based on this, the author isn't in the wrong. They were doing their job to inform the customer, which is the right approach. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
