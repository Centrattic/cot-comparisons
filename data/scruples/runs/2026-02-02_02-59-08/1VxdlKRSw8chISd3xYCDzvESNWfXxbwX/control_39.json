I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who detailed the graphic content in GTA V to a mother was in the wrong. So, first, I need to understand the situation thoroughly.\n\nThe person works at Target, in electronics. A mother came in to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old son. The employee explained the M rating and the graphic content like torture scenes, sexual themes, swearing, and online aspects. The mother decided not to buy it. The co-worker felt like the employee was \"cockblocking\" her son and made a big deal about it with other coworkers. The employee is now wondering if they were in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the employee provided accurate information about the game's content, which led the mother to make an informed decision. The co-worker and others had mixed reactions. The employee's motivation was to help the parent make a responsible choice for their child.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the employee acted in good faith. They were trying to protect a child from inappropriate content by informing the parent. The M rating is a warning, and the employee was just reinforcing that. The mother was appreciative and changed her mind, which suggests that the employee did the right thing. The co-worker's reaction seems more about wanting the kid to get the game rather than considering the parent's responsibility.\n\nHowever, there's a nuance here. The employee's job is to provide information, not to make decisions for the customers. So, while the employee didn't have the right to stop the sale, they did their duty by informing the parent. The parent then made the choice based on that information. So the employee isn't the asshole because they didn't overstep; they gave the facts. The co-worker might be in the wrong for pressuring the employee to not interfere.\n\nIn terms of company policy, employees are usually encouraged to explain product details accurately. The employee here followed that. The mother was grateful, so the action was helpful. The co-worker's complaint is misplaced here because the employee didn't do anything wrong. The answer would likely be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
