I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author worked at Target and helped a mother buy a game for her 9-year-old son. The mother chose GTA V, but the author explained the M rating, graphically described the content like torture scenes, sexual themes, swearing, and the online aspect. The mother then decided not to buy it and chose a different game. The co-worker was upset, calling it \"videogame cockblocking,\" but the author feels they were just doing the right thing by informing the parent.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author was wrong. Let me break it down. The author provided information about the game's content as requested by the mother. The mother used that info to make a decision. The author wasn't the one making the purchase; they were facilitating the sale but giving necessary details. The M rating is a guide, and the author's job might involve advising on content. However, the co-worker felt the author overstepped by being too graphic. But the author's reasoning is that they would want the same info if it were their kids.\n\nFactors to consider: The author didn't force the mother to not buy the game; they provided info. The mother made the decision based on that. The author's intent was to help the parent make an informed choice. The co-worker's reaction seems to be about the method\u2014maybe the details were too explicit\u2014but the law and ethical standards in retail usually support informing customers about content, especially for parental guidance. The key is whether the author crossed a line by being too graphic. If the mother asked for more info, the author had a duty to explain accurately. So, the answer would likely be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because they were providing necessary information to help a parent make a decision, which aligns with responsible sales practices.\n"
