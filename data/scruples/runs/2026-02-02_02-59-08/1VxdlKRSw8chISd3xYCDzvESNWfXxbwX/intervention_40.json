I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the scenario again carefully.\n\nThe author works at Target in electronics. A customer comes in wanting to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old son. The author explains the M rating, mentions graphic content like torture scenes, sexual themes, swearing, and online elements. The mother decides against the purchase. The co-worker \"cockblocked\" her and made a big deal about it. The author is now questioning if they were in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. GTA V is an M-rated game, which is intended for mature audiences. The rating is there for a reason, including the content the author mentioned. The mother was seeking information because she was concerned. The author provided the necessary details that the mother asked for. The mother then made an informed decision not to buy the game. \n\nThe author's co-worker criticized them, but the author's intent was to inform the parent about the content. The author mentions they were doing what they would want if they had kids. That's a responsible approach, ensuring parents are aware of potential inappropriate content for their children. \n\nIs there any wrongdoing here? Well, the mother asked for more information, and the author gave it. The author didn't force the mother not to buy it; she made her own decision. The co-worker's reaction is more about the method of delivery or the fact that the sale didn't go through, but the author's actions seem to align with helping the parent make an informed choice. \n\nI don't see the author doing anything unethical. The ESRB ratings exist for a reason, and the author is upholding their responsibility by informing the customer. The co-worker's criticism seems misplaced. The author isn't in the wrong here. They provided necessary information, and the mother chose not to proceed. That's a positive outcome from a responsible selling point of view. So the answer should be B.\n"
