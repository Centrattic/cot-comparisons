I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for explaining the graphic content of GTA V to a mother buying a game for her 9-year-old.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the situation. The author works at Target and was helping a customer buy a game for her son. The mother said the kid is 9, and GTA V has an M rating. The author explained the game's content, like torture scenes, sexual themes, swearing, and online aspects. The mother decided not to buy it. The co-worker was upset, saying it was \"cockblocking,\" but the author thinks they were just doing what they would want someone to do for their own kids.\n\nThe key points here are: the age of the child, the content of the game, and the author's intent. GTA V is rated M for mature audiences, which typically means content suitable for 17+ years. The mother was seeking advice because she didn't know much about the game. The author provided factual information about the game's content, which led the mother to make a different choice. \n\nNow, considering the author's actions. They were providing information about the game's content, which is necessary for a parent to make an informed decision. The parent might not have been aware of the specific details, even if the game has an M rating. The author's intent was to help the parent make a responsible choice for their child's well-being. \n\nOn the other hand, the co-worker's reaction is about thinking the author is being overbearing. But the co-worker's opinion doesn't necessarily mean the author was wrong. The mother appreciated the information and made a different decision. \n\nThe law and ethical standards usually support providing accurate information to help someone make an informed decision, especially regarding a child's media consumption. There's no indication the author was being malicious or overstepping, just giving necessary details about the game's content. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They were being responsible by informing the parent of the game's content so she could make a decision appropriate for her child's age.\n"
