I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AskReddit post is in the wrong for not letting a mother buy GTA V for her 9-year-old. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what GTA V's content rating is. It's rated M for Mature, which typically means 17+ according to the ESRB. The game does have violence, sexual content, and strong language. The author explained these details to the mother, which led her to choose a different game.\n\nThe co-worker was upset, calling it \"videogame cockblocking.\" But the author's intention was to inform the parent about the game's content, which is age-inappropriate for a 9-year-old. The author justified their actions by saying they would want the same info if they were buying for their own kids.\n\nLegally, there might not be a wrong here. The author isn't a parent, but they have a responsibility to provide accurate information. The mother made the decision after being informed. Ethically, protecting a child from inappropriate content is a common concern. The author wasn't forcing the mother to do anything; they just provided facts. The mother made the choice. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They acted in a way that supports informed decision-making. The co-worker's frustration is about someone else's parenting choice, which the author had a right to question based on the child's age. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
