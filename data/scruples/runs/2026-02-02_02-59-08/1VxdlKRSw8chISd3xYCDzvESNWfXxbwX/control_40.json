I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for detailing graphic scenes in GTA V to a mother buying the game for her 9-year-old. The situation is from an \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) context, so it's about social judgment.\n\nFirst, the author's action was to inform the mother about the game's content, leading her to choose a different game. The key points here are the age of the child (9 years old) and the content of GTA V (M-rated, with graphic violence, sexual themes, swearing). The mother was seeking advice, and the author provided information that made her decide against buying it. \n\nThe co-worker criticized the author as \"cockblocking,\" but others had mixed reactions. The author's reasoning is that they were acting how they would want for their own kids if they had any, emphasizing informed decision-making.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and responsibilities. Retail employees often provide information about products, especially when it comes to age-appropriate content. The ESRB ratings exist to help parents make informed decisions. The author is essentially upholding the ESRB's intent by explaining the M rating's implications. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author overstepped by being too graphic. But the mother asked for more information, so the author was just giving detailed info she requested. The child's age is a factor here; 9 is quite young for an M-rated game. The author's actions could be seen as protective, ensuring the parent makes a responsible choice.\n\nOn the flip side, if the author had gone beyond the requested information or was unnecessarily graphic, that could be an issue. But based on the description, the author provided the details the mother asked for, which led to a positive outcome (choosing a different game). \n\nThe co-worker's reaction might stem from a different perspective, perhaps thinking the mother should have the autonomy to decide, but the author's intent was to inform, not to impose. The mixed responses from other coworkers suggest that there's no clear consensus, but the author's action seems justified given the child's age and the game's content.\n\nIn conclusion, the author was just doing their job of providing accurate information to help the parent make a decision, especially regarding content unsuitable for a young child. So the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
