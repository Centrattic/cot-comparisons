I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is a Target employee who helped a mother decide against buying GTA V for her 9-year-old son. They gave detailed info about the game's content, which led the mom to choose a different game. The coworker and others in the break room had mixed reactions, with some criticizing the employee. The main question is whether the employee was in the wrong by doing this.\n\nFirst, consider the role of the employee. Their job is to assist customers, which includes providing accurate information about products. GTA V has an M rating, indicating it's for mature audiences. The employee explained the content, which is part of their responsibility to inform the customer. The mother asked for more details, so the employee answered truthfully. The employee didn't push the game; they provided necessary info to help the mother make an informed decision.\n\nNext, the concern is about the game's suitability for a child. GTA V includes graphic violence, sexual content, and strong language. The employee's action was to prevent a potentially inappropriate purchase, aligning with the parent's duty to protect their child. The employee's reasoning is that if they were a parent in that situation, they'd want similar information. This is a reasonable perspective.\n\nThe coworker's criticism is about \"cockblocking,\" suggesting the employee is interfering with the child's game choice. But the employee's role is to provide information, not to impose personal views. The mother ultimately made the decision based on the information given. The employee didn't force her to choose another game; they just informed her of the content, which is in line with their job to help customers make responsible choices.\n\nAlso, the mixed response from coworkers doesn't determine right or wrong. The key points here are the employee's duty to inform and the appropriateness of the product for the child's age. The action taken was within their professional responsibility and ethical duty to protect a minor from inappropriate content. Therefore, the employee isn't in the wrong.\n"
