I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that they're a Target employee who helped a mother not buy GTA V for her 9-year-old by detailing the graphic content. The co-worker was annoyed, and the author is unsure if they did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The mother wanted a game for her 9-year-old, and GTA V is rated M for Mature. The employee explained the content, which led the mother to choose a different game. The co-worker criticized the employee as being a \"cockblock,\" but others had mixed reactions.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that if they were a parent buying a game without knowing the content, they'd want that information. So they believe they were just doing what they would expect from others. \n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. GTA V is an M-rated game, which is intended for ages 17+. The game does have violent and mature content. The employee provided accurate information about the game's content, which is their job to do, especially when a customer is making a purchase decision for a child. The mother was the one who asked for more information, so the employee was fulfilling her request. \n\nThe co-worker's criticism seems to stem from the idea that the employee is overstepping, but actually, the employee was helping the customer make an informed choice. The mother made the choice after being informed, so the employee didn't force her to do anything. \n\nThe key here is whether the employee acted beyond their role. Since the mother asked for more details and the employee provided them, it's within their responsibility to inform. The author's intention was to help the mother make a decision that aligns with her child's age and the game's rating. \n\nThere's no indication that the employee was rude or gave false information. They were straightforward and honest. The mother's decision was her own, so the author isn't in the wrong. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
