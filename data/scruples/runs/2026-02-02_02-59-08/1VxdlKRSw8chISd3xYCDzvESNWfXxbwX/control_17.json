I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that someone working at Target helped a parent decide not to buy GTA V for their 9-year-old by detailing the game's graphic content. The employee's coworker was upset, but the mother decided against buying it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The employee provided information about the game's content, which includes the M rating, graphic scenes, and other inappropriate elements. The mother was informed and made an educated decision. The employee's action was based on the ESRB rating and the desire to protect the child from content unsuitable for their age. The coworker's complaint seems to be about overstepping, but the main concern was the parent's responsibility.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the employee is acting as a responsible employee by informing the customer adequately. The parents are the ones who should make the final decision based on the provided info. The employee isn't forcing the mother not to buy it but is giving her all the necessary details. The ESRB system is in place for a reason, and employees are expected to follow guidelines when selling age-restricted items. \n\nThe coworker's argument that it's a \"dick move\" might stem from a belief that the employee is interfering, but the employee's action is in line with protecting minors from inappropriate content. The employee's own reasoning is that they'd want the same for their own kids, which is a valid parental concern. \n\nSo, the employee isn't in the wrong. They provided the necessary information to help the parent make an informed choice, which is their duty. The parent then made the decision based on that. The coworker's disapproval doesn't change the fact that the employee acted responsibly. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
