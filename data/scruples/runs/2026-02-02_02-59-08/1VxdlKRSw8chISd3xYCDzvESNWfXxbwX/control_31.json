I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that they worked at Target and helped a mother buy a game for her 9-year-old son. The mother wanted Grand Theft Auto V, which has a Mature rating. The author explained the graphic content, like torture scenes, sexual themes, swearing, and the online aspect. The mother then decided not to buy it and chose a different game. The co-worker was upset, calling it \"videogame cockblocking,\" and others had mixed reactions. The author feels they were just doing what they would want for their own kids, giving the mother the necessary info to make a decision.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author provided accurate information about the game's content, which is age-inappropriate for a 9-year-old. The mother was the one making the decision, and the author's job is to inform customers about the products. The co-worker's complaint is about \"cockblocking,\" implying the author stopped a purchase, but the author's intention was to protect a child from inappropriate content. \n\nI need to determine if the author was wrong. In terms of ethics and job responsibilities, it's part of the job to inform customers about product content, especially when it comes to age-appropriate material. The author didn't force the sale; they provided information and let the mother decide. The mother used that info to make a choice, which is exactly what the author intended. The co-worker's reaction is more about the sale being denied, but the author's action was responsible. \n\nAlso, from a consumer protection standpoint, informing parents about the content of a game they're buying for their children is a good practice. The author isn't dictating the mother's choice but giving her the facts. So, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
