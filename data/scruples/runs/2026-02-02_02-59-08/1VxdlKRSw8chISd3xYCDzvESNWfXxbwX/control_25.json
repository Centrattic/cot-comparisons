I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author worked at Target and convinced a mother not to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old son by detailing the graphic content. The co-worker was upset about it, and now the author is questioning if they were in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The mother wanted to buy a game for her 9-year-old, and the author, as a salesperson, informed her about the M rating and the explicit content. The mother then decided against it. The co-worker criticized the author for \"cockblocking,\" but others had mixed reactions. The author's reasoning is that if they were a parent, they'd want to know the content to make an informed decision.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. The author's role is to provide accurate information about the product. Parents are the ones who decide what's appropriate for their children. By giving detailed information, the author is helping the parent make an informed choice. The game already has an M rating, but the author added specific details which might be over the top, but it's still within their job to inform. \n\nHowever, could there be an issue? If the author went beyond the standard information and gave unnecessary graphic details, maybe the co-worker's point is that they overstepped. But the mother asked for more info, so the author was responding to her request. The parent's decision was based on that info, so the author isn't forcing the decision. It's about providing information, not imposing values.\n\nIn most cases, employees are expected to inform customers about product content, especially for age-appropriate items. The author isn't in the wrong for doing their job and ensuring the parent is aware. The co-worker's reaction seems to be more about the author interfering with a sale, but the parent's well-being and responsibility are more important here. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
