      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who didn't tip their bartender is in the wrong.\n\nThe situation is that the person went to a club with friends, invited four friends to four drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without asking. The person was drunk but not too much to notice. They then tipped 0%, told the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender said he wouldn't serve them if they didn't tip. The person thought they were willing to tip an appropriate amount but resented the bartender adding the tip without permission.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms around tipping. In many places, tipping is customary and expected for services, especially in the hospitality industry. Bartenders rely on tips as a significant part of their income. However, adding a tip without the customer's consent can be seen as unethical. Some argue that it's a way to ensure they get a tip, but others see it as taking advantage, especially if the customer is impaired.\n\nThe person was drunk, which might affect their judgment, but they weren't too drunk to notice the bartender's action. They responded by refusing to tip, which led to the bartender refusing service. The person's reasoning was that the bartender shouldn't take advantage of drunk customers. But in reality, the bartender's role is to serve, and if a customer is intoxicated, it's their responsibility to manage their behavior, including tipping appropriately.\n\nHowever, there's a conflict here. The person might feel that the bartender overstepped by adding the tip without permission. But in most cases, the customer has control over the tip. If the bartender added it, perhaps the person should have corrected it at the time. Instead, they responded by not tipping, which is a direct retaliation. This could be seen as taking the bartender's actions as a personal slight.\n\nBut considering the standard expectation of tipping, even if the person felt wronged, not tipping in return might be seen as inconsiderate. The bartender was trying to ensure a tip, which is a common practice, albeit without transparency. The person's reaction of 0% tip might be too harsh, especially since they admitted they were willing to tip appropriately. The interaction could have been resolved by discussing it calmly rather than refusing to tip.\n\nAlso, the bartender's refusal to serve if they didn't tip is a bit extreme, but in some establishments, they might enforce a minimum tip. However, the person's response of not tipping at all could be seen as a deliberate choice to withhold payment, which is problematic.\n\nIn conclusion, while the bartender's action of adding the tip without asking was inappropriate, the person's response of not tipping at all, especially when they could have just corrected the tip amount, might place the responsibility more on the person. They could have communicated their disapproval without withholding all the tip, which is a significant part of the bartender's income. Therefore, the person might be in the wrong.\n"
