      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. Let me try to break this down.\n\nThe situation: The author went to a club with friends, bought 4 drinks for them. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing the customer. The author, who was a bit drunk but not too much, noticed this and decided to tip 0%. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them anymore if they didn't tip. The author felt that the bartender was taking advantage by adding the tip without asking.\n\nFirst, I need to consider standard tipping practices. In many places, especially in the service industry, a 15-20% tip is customary in the US. However, some businesses automatically add a service charge for groups or events. But the key point here is that the bartender added 20% without telling the customer. That's a problem because the customer might not be aware it's happening. The author noticed and decided not to tip, which led to a conflict.\n\nNow, the author was drunk, but not to the point of not being aware. The bartender's action of adding the tip without communication could be seen as deceptive. The author's response of not tipping at all is a reaction to that. However, the author might have handled it differently. Instead of zero, maybe they could have adjusted the tip amount or asked about it first. But the bartender's refusal to serve is also an issue. It's not ethical for a service provider to threaten not serving someone over a tip, especially if there's a misunderstanding.\n\nSo, the author's mistake might be not addressing the issue calmly. If they wanted to tip an appropriate amount, they could have explained to the bartender that they didn't want the automatic 20%. But their response was to tip 0%, which could be seen as harsh. However, the bartender's action of not informing them is also wrong. The responsibility isn't entirely on the customer if the service provider didn't communicate properly. But the customer could have handled it better. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't in the wrong because the bartender didn't inform them. However, the author's response of 0% might be too extreme. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about the best action. So the bartender's part is wrong for not informing, and the author's reaction is a response to that. Therefore, the author isn't entirely at fault.\n"
