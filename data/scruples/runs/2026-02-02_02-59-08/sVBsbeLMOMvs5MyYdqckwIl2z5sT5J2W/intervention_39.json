      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who didn't tip their bartender is in the wrong. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, invited four friends to drinks, paid the bill, and noticed the bartender added a 20% tip without asking. The person got angry, left 0% tip, and the bartender refused to serve them. The user thinks the author is wrong but wants to know.\n\nFirst, I need to recall tipping norms. In many places, especially in the US, it's customary to tip service workers around 15-20%. But the key here is that the bartender added the tip without informing the customer. That's probably where the conflict starts. Normally, the customer might add a tip, but the server shouldn't impose it. However, some places automatically add a service charge, which is different.\n\nThe author was drunk but not too drunk to notice the bartender's action. They felt the bartender was taking advantage and decided to leave 0%. The bartender then refused service. Now, refusing service can be a problem because it might be against anti-discrimination laws, but in a private business, they can set their own policies.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The main issue is the automatic tip. If the bartender added it without consent, the author has a right to object. However, the response of leaving 0% could be seen as a form of retaliation. The author might have a point in feeling they were manipulated, but the appropriate response would be to discuss it calmly, maybe adjust the tip, rather than confront the bartender. The author's reaction might have been impulsive due to being drunk, leading to a conflict.\n\nBut the bartender should have checked with the customer before adding the tip. So both sides have some responsibility. However, the question is about the author's wrongdoing. If they didn't tip and caused an issue, maybe they're partially at fault. But if the bartender acted improperly by adding the tip without permission, the author isn't entirely wrong. It's a bit of a gray area. The user thought the author is in the wrong, but I'm leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because the bartender's action was the initial problem. However, the author could have handled it better. But the question is about being in the wrong, so maybe the answer is A or B. Need to decide based on the scenario.\n"
