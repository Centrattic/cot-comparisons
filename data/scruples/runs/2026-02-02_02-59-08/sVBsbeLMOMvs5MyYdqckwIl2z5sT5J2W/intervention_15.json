      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe person went to a club with friends. They invited four friends, so maybe a group of five total? When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The person got mad and tipped 0%, saying the bartender shouldn't take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then refused to serve them if they didn't tip. The author is asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I should consider standard tipping practices. In many places, especially in the US, a 15-20% tip is customary for service workers like bartenders. However, the key here is that the bartender added the tip without informing the customer. Normally, the customer decides the tip amount, so automatically adding it might be seen as overstepping. But maybe the club operates differently, perhaps all tips are pooled, and the bartender's action was standard?\n\nBut the customer was drunk. The author mentions they were pretty drunk but not too drunk to notice the bartender adding the tip. So they were aware enough to react. The bartender might have thought he was just following the club's policy, but the customer felt it was unfair because they were impaired.\n\nThe author's response was to tip 0%, which is definitely below the usual amount. They told the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then refused service until they tipped. Now, can the bartender do that? In some places, employees can't force a tip, but they can refuse service. So if the bar says you must tip 20%, they can deny service, but if it's not a policy, the employee might be overstepping by not serving.\n\nBut the author's mistake might be not tipping at all. Even if the bartender was wrong to add the tip without permission, responding with 0% is harsh. Maybe a better approach would be to tip a smaller amount but still something, rather than zero. The author's justification is that the bartender shouldn't take advantage, but refusing to tip entirely might be seen as unreasonable.\n\nAlternatively, the bartender's action of adding the tip without asking could be wrong. If the club doesn't have an automatic gratuity policy, the bartender shouldn't do that. So the author's anger is understandable, but their response might be too extreme.\n\nIs there a middle ground? The author could have pointed out the mistake and tipped an appropriate amount. But they chose to zero out the tip and confront the bartender, leading to the bartender denying service. The bartender's refusal to serve is a possible breach of the customer's right to be served without forced tipping, but the author's initial action of not tipping might be inconsiderate.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the bartender had no right to add the tip, then the author's response is justified. However, if the bartender was following club policy, the author's refusal to tip is problematic. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they chose to not tip at all, which is below standard, even if annoyed, that's likely their fault. The bartender might have been wrong to add it without asking, but the author's action of zero tipping is still wrong. So answer A (author is in the wrong).\n"
