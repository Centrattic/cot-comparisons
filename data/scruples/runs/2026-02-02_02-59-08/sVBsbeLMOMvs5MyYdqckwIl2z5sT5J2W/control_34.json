      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person went to a club with friends, invited four friends to four drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without asking. The person was drunk but not too drunk to notice and responded by not tipping at all, telling the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them if they didn't tip. The person argues they were willing to tip but the bartender shouldn't have added it without permission.\n\nFirst, tipping norms: In many places, especially in the US, a 15-20% tip is standard for good service. However, it's typically expected that the customer decides the tip amount based on their discretion. If the bartender added the tip without the customer's knowledge, that's unusual. The customer might feel it's an overreach, especially if they wanted to leave a different amount or none. \n\nThe person was drunk but not incapacitated. They noticed the added tip and reacted. Arguing that the bartender shouldn't take advantage of their state makes sense. However, not tipping at all is problematic because it denies the bartender any gratuity, which is part of their income. The bartender's response to refuse service is also a point\u2014maybe he was protecting himself from being shortchanged.\n\nBut the key issue is whether the customer had the right to refuse the added tip. If the bartender added the tip without consent, maybe the customer is justified in objecting. However, in many establishments, the total on the bill includes a suggested tip, and the customer might have the option to adjust it. If the bartender didn't communicate that, the customer might not know they can change it. But in this case, the customer did notice and decided to leave zero, which could be seen as a poor choice, even if the initial action was wrong.\n\nSo, the author might be at fault for not leaving at least a token amount, even if they were upset. The bartender's action was inappropriate, but the customer's response was also extreme. The author's willingness to tip \"appropriately\" isn't clear if they left zero. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not tipping at all despite the situation.\n"
