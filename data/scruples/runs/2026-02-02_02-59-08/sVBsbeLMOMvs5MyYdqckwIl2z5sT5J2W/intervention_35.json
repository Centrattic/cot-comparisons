      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, invited four of them to four drinks, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing the person. The author was drunk but not too drunk to notice, and they decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then refused to serve them unless they tipped. The author is questioning if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider standard tipping practices. In many places, especially in the service industry, tipping is customary. Bartenders rely on tips as part of their income. However, the key point here is that the bartender added the tip without informing the customer. Normally, tips are left at the customer's discretion. If the bartender added it without asking, that's a bit of an issue because it's not the customer's choice. The author felt that this was taking advantage of their intoxicated state, which could be a valid concern because being drunk might impair judgment, but it's not a legal excuse. However, the bartender's action of adding a tip without consent could be problematic.\n\nThen there's the author's response. They decided to tip 0%, which is a direct reaction to the bartender's action. The bartender then refused service, which might be against the law in some places because refusing service based on payment method or amount can be illegal. But the question is about moral wrong, not legal. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the bartender added the tip without consent, the author has a valid reason to refuse. However, the author chose to tip 0% as a form of protest. But in many cultures, not tipping at all is seen as rude or disrespectful, regardless of the bartender's actions. The author might be justified in their reaction, but from a societal norm perspective, they might still be considered in the wrong because they didn't tip at all. Alternatively, if the bartender shouldn't have added the tip without consent, then the author's response is a form of standing up for themselves. \n\nBut the user thinks the author is in the wrong. Maybe because even if the bartender did something wrong, the customer still has a responsibility to tip appropriately. The author's action of not tipping could be seen as retaliation rather than just a response. However, the bartender also acted in a way that could be considered manipulative by adding the tip without consent. \n\nIn some places, it's against the law for a server to add a tip without the customer's knowledge, so the bartender might be at fault there. But the author's refusal to tip could still be seen as a breach of social norms. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer might depend on the cultural context. If the bartender shouldn't have added the tip, then the author's refusal is a reasonable response. But if the expectation is to tip regardless, then the author is in the wrong. However, since the bartender acted in a way that could be considered unethical, the author might not be entirely at fault. But the user's question is whether the author is in the wrong. Given that the author didn't tip and the bartender added it without consent, there's a case for both sides. However, in many societies, the expectation is to tip, so not tipping could be seen as the wrong action, even if the bartender was at fault. So the answer could be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they didn't tip, even though the bartender's actions were questionable.\n"
