      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who didn't tip their bartender is in the wrong. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, bought drinks for four people, and the bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The person was drunk but not too drunk to notice, so they decided to tip 0% and told the bartender not to take advantage of people. The bartender then refused to serve them if they didn't tip. The question is whether the author (the person who didn't tip) is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the usual tipping norms. In the US, tipping is customary, usually around 15-20%, especially in places like bars and restaurants where service staff rely on tips. If the bartender added a 20% tip automatically, that might be part of the standard practice there. However, the user felt it was unfair because it wasn't communicated to them first. They responded by not tipping, which led to a confrontation.\n\nNow, the key points here are: Did the bartender have the right to add the tip without informing the customer? In many places, businesses can include a service charge, but it's usually disclosed upfront. If the bartender added it without telling, that might be an issue. Also, the user was drunk but still able to notice the tip being added and choose to not tip. However, the bartender then threatened not to serve them if they didn't tip. That's a problem because the bartender can't legally refuse service just because of a tip amount. They can refuse service for other reasons, but not for not tipping. \n\nThe user's reasoning is that the bartender took advantage by adding the tip without permission. But the user's response was to not tip at all, which is against the social norm. However, the bartender's action of adding the tip without informing might be the initial issue. \n\nSo, who is at fault here? The user acted on their frustration, which is understandable if they felt disrespected. But in terms of customary practice, tipping is expected, and not tipping is generally frowned upon. However, the bartender's approach of adding the tip without consent might be the root problem. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the bartender added the tip without permission, maybe the user was within their rights to object. But by not tipping at all, they violated the norm. However, the bartender's response was also inappropriate. \n\nIt's a bit of a grey area. If the user had tipped the appropriate amount, they wouldn't be at fault. By not tipping, they are, but maybe the bartender's initial action contributed to the conflict. However, the user's responsibility is to tip, regardless of the bartender's actions. So maybe the user is partially at fault for not tipping, but the bartender is also wrong for adding the tip without consent and threatening service. But the question is only about the user's fault. \n\nIn most cases, not tipping is considered wrong, so even if the bartender acted improperly, the user's response of not tipping would make them at fault. So the answer would be A.\n"
