      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the person who didn't tip their bartender is at fault. The scenario is that they went out with friends, invited four friends to drinks, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without asking. The user, already pretty drunk but not too drunk to notice, decided to tip 0% and told the bartender not to take advantage of people who are drunk. The bartender then said he won't serve them anymore if they don't tip. The user claims they wanted to leave an appropriate tip but were upset about the bartender adding the tip without permission.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around tipping. In many places, especially in the service industry, tipping is expected as a way for servers to earn a living wage. Bartenders typically rely on tips as a significant portion of their income. However, the user's issue was that the bartender added the tip without their knowledge. This could be a point of contention. Legally, in some regions, a bartender can't add a tip without informing the customer, as it's not transparent. So maybe the bartender was in the wrong there.\n\nBut then the user decided to leave a 0% tip in response. Even if the bartender added the tip without permission, the user's act of not tipping at all might be seen as a direct retaliation. The user might have felt disrespected that the tip was added without consent, but responding with zero tip could be seen as inconsiderate. Bartenders depend on tips, so leaving nothing could be harsh, even if the initial action was wrong.\n\nThe user was drunk, but they claim they were still aware of what was happening. Being drunk doesn't absolve someone from responsibility in this context. The bartender's response of refusing to serve them might have been extreme, but it's a common policy in some places to require a minimum tip or to refuse service if a customer is disruptive. However, the bartender's statement about not serving them anymore could be seen as aggressive.\n\nSo, the question is whether the user's actions were justified. The user had the right to tip whatever they wanted, but choosing to leave 0% after being annoyed by the automatic tip might not be fair. The initial action by the bartender (adding the tip without permission) was perhaps unethical or against policy, but the user's response of not tipping at all might still be inconsiderate. The user might have a point in wanting to tip appropriately themselves, but the way they handled it could be seen as inconsiderate. Therefore, the user might be at fault for not tipping despite the bartender's mistake, but maybe the bartender also shares some responsibility for adding the tip without consent. However, since the user is asking if they're in the wrong, the main point is their decision to not tip. In social norms, even if the bartender did something wrong, the user's response was to tip nothing, which is harsh. So the answer is likely A (they are in the wrong), but there's nuance.\n"
