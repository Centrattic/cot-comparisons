      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're at fault for not tipping the bartender. So, the situation is they went to a club with friends, bought four drinks, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The person noticed and decided to tip 0%, saying the bartender shouldn't take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then threatened not to serve them if they didn't tip. The person is wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to think about tipping norms. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is expected for service jobs like bartenders. Even if the customer is drunk, the expectation is usually that a tip is left. However, the bartender added the tip without asking, which might have been a mistake. The person's response was to remove the tip entirely, which is a strong reaction. \n\nBut why did the person respond that way? They felt the bartender was taking advantage. If the bartender didn't inform them first, maybe that's a breach of protocol. Normally, the server would ask if you want to add a tip, or the customer would have the option to adjust it. If the bartender just added it without permission, that's probably not standard practice. So the person might have a point there. \n\nHowever, the person's reaction was to tip 0%, which could be seen as rude or ungrateful, especially since the bartender was providing service. Even if the tip was added incorrectly, the person could have pointed that out and adjusted it themselves instead of removing it completely. The threat from the bartender to not serve them if they don't tip might be a problem too, because that's not the customer's responsibility. The bartender can't force a tip, but the customer can choose to pay as they wish. \n\nBut in many places, tipping is part of the service, and not tipping could lead to poor service. However, the bartender's approach of adding the tip without consent is also an issue. The person might not be entirely at fault because the bartender's action was inappropriate. However, the person's response of not tipping at all might also be seen as extreme. \n\nSo considering both sides: the bartender's mistake was adding the tip without permission, which the person noticed and corrected. The person's correction was to remove the tip entirely, which could be seen as a valid response if they felt it was added without consent. But in the service industry, expecting a tip is standard, so not leaving any might be considered rude. \n\nI think the key here is whether the bartender should have asked first. If the person felt misled because the tip was added without their knowledge, then their response was a reaction to that. However, the appropriate action would be to inform the bartender and adjust the tip to an appropriate amount. Removing it altogether might be seen as wrong because it's not customary to not tip at all. \n\nSo maybe the person is in the wrong because they didn't adjust the tip to a reasonable amount and instead cut it out completely. The bartender's mistake doesn't justify the person not tipping, especially since the bartender might be relying on tips for income. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
