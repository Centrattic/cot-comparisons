      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they went to a club, invited four friends for drinks, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The author, who was drunk but not too drunk to notice, decided to tip 0% and told the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then refused to serve them if they didn't tip. The author is asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the usual tipping norms. In many places, especially in the US, a standard tip is around 15-20%, and it's typically left up to the customer to decide. The bartender adding the tip automatically might be a policy of the establishment, but sometimes places do that if they don't want to rely on customers to tip. However, not all places do this, and some customers might not expect it, especially if they're not familiar with the policy.\n\nThe author was in a group, and they were drunk. Being drunk doesn't excuse poor behavior, but it might affect their judgment. The key here is the bartender adding the tip without informing the customer. If the bartender didn't mention that the tip was being added, the customer might not be aware, which could be a problem. But wait, the author noticed the bartender putting in 20% and decided to tip 0%, which is contradictory because if they were going to tip 0%, why didn't they just pay the bill without the tip? Or maybe they wanted to override the bartender's addition.\n\nThe author's reasoning was that the bartender shouldn't take advantage of drunk people. However, the bartender was adding a standard tip, not taking any extra. Maybe the author felt that since they were drunk, they were being manipulated into paying more. But in reality, tipping is expected as part of service, and the bartender might have been following a policy to ensure they receive tips even if customers don't leave any. Alternatively, if the bartender added the tip without the customer's knowledge, that could be a breach of trust.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's response was to tip 0%, which could be seen as retaliatory. The bartender then refused service, which is within their rights if the customer is being disruptive. The author might have been in the wrong by not tipping, especially since the bartender was trying to add the standard tip. But if the bartender didn't inform the customer, maybe the customer was in the right for objecting. However, expecting the bartender to add a tip without the customer's knowledge might not be fair either. The author's action of not tipping could be seen as disrespectful, especially in a service industry where tips are part of the income. The bartender's refusal to serve if they didn't tip could be part of their policy to encourage tipping, but if the customer is a regular or if the situation escalates, it could lead to a conflict.\n\nIn summary, the author might be in the wrong for not tipping and being confrontational, even if the bartender added the tip without mentioning it. The bartender's action, while possibly not ideal, was standard, and the author's response was inappropriate. So I think the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
