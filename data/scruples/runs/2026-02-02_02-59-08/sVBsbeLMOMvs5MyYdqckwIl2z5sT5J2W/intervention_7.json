      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. The scenario is that the author went to a club with friends, invited four of them to drinks, and when paying, the bartender added 20% without asking. The author was drunk but not too drunk to notice, so he left a 0% tip, arguing that the bartender shouldn't take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then refused to serve them unless they tipped an appropriate amount.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms around tipping. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is a standard practice where a service fee is expected. If the bartender added a 20% tip without asking, that's unusual. Typically, the customer is supposed to decide the tip amount, not the server adding it automatically. However, some establishments do have a policy of adding a service charge, especially in places like clubs or bars. If the bartender had a policy of automatic tips, the author might not have known about it. But the key here is that the bartender didn't inform the customer before adding the tip.\n\nThe author's response was to leave a 0% tip, which is a direct contradiction to the automatic 20%. The author's reasoning was that the bartender was taking advantage of someone who was drunk. However, even if the author was drunk, he claims he wasn't too drunk to notice the bartender adding the tip. So the author made a conscious decision to not tip, which is a valid choice, but the bartender refused to serve them because of it. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, the standard expectation is to tip, but the bartender's action of adding a tip without consent could be seen as manipulative. The author responded by refusing to tip, which the bartender then used as a reason to cut off service. Legally, a bartender can refuse service for any reason, but ethically, if the bartender added the tip without asking, the author might have a point. However, in terms of social norms, the author's decision to not tip after the bartender added the tip might be seen as a breach of etiquette. \n\nThe author's justification is that the bartender shouldn't take advantage of drunk people. But the author was the one who was drunk and invited friends to drinks, which might imply they were the ones in a vulnerable position. However, the bartender's action of not serving them because of the lack of tip could be seen as taking advantage. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author's actions were a response to the bartender's unauthorized addition of a tip. The author had the right to decide their own tip amount. The bartender's refusal to serve them is within his rights but may not be the ethical thing to do. Therefore, the author might not be entirely in the wrong, but there's a case to be made either way. However, given that the bartender didn't inform the customer about the tip and the author was conscious enough to make a choice, the author might not be in the wrong.\n"
