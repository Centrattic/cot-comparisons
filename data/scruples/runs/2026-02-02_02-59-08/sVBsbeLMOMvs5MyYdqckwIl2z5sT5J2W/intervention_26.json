      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about not tipping a bartender after being invited to a club with friends.\n\nSo the author went to the club, invited four friends for four drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling the author. The author, who was drunk but not too drunk, decided to tip 0% and told the bartender not to take advantage of people who are drunk. The bartender then refused to serve the author. The author is wondering if they're at fault here.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The possible answers are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The author was hosting friends, which implies they were paying for the group. The bartender added a tip without permission, which the author noticed and reacted to by not tipping. The bartender then refused service if the author didn't tip. \n\nIn many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary and expected, often around 15-20%. However, the bartender shouldn't have added a tip without the customer's knowledge or consent. That's a problem because the customer has the right to decide how much to tip. The author's reaction might be justified if the bartender didn't ask first. However, the author then decided to tip 0%, which is unusual and could be seen as rude or disrespectful, especially if the bartender was following the standard practice in their establishment. \n\nThe author's argument is that the bartender was taking advantage by adding a tip unilaterally. But the author's response of refusing to tip at all might be extreme. Even if the bartender made a mistake, the appropriate response would be to adjust the tip amount or ask to remove the added tip, not to retaliate by not tipping. \n\nAlso, the bartender's refusal to serve could be a breach of their own policy, but they do have some discretion in refusing service if a customer is being difficult. However, the initial act of adding the tip without consent is on the bartender. The author's decision to not tip in response might have been a mistake because it goes against the social norm of tipping, especially since the author was hosting friends and might have been expected to be generous.\n\nSo, considering both sides: the bartender's error in adding a tip without permission is a misstep, but the author's response of not tipping at all is also problematic. The author could have asked the bartender to remove the tip and then decided on an appropriate amount themselves. Instead, they chose to not tip, which is likely to be seen as wrong in terms of social dining etiquette. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
