      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they went to a club with friends, bought drinks for four people, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without asking. The author, who was a bit drunk but not too drunk, decided to tip 0% and told the bartender not to take advantage of people who are drunk. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them if they didn't tip. The author is asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider standard tipping practices. In many places, especially in the service industry like bartending, tipping is customary and often expected. The usual tip is around 15-20%, which is why the bartender might have added 20% automatically. However, the key issue here is that the bartender added the tip without informing the customer. Normally, when you pay by card, sometimes the machine adds a tip, but if it's a manual process, the server should check with the customer first.\n\nThe author was drunk but not too drunk to notice the bartender adding the tip. They felt it was an attempt to take advantage, so they refused to tip. The bartender then threatened not to serve them if they didn't tip. The question is whether the author was in the wrong for not tipping.\n\nOn one hand, the bartender added a tip without asking, which might be a breach of etiquette or protocol. On the other hand, the author's response of 0% after the bartender's action could be seen as a stand against being overcharged, even if the tip was customary. The bartender's threat might be an overreaction, but the author's refusal could also be seen as disrespectful or causing a scene in a public place.\n\nAnother angle: tipping is usually voluntary. If the bartender added a tip without consent, that's on him. The author might not be obligated to tip, especially if they felt the service didn't warrant it. However, in many places, not tipping can lead to negative consequences, like the bartender refusing service as he did. But the threat to not serve them if they don't tip might be problematic because it could be considered coercing for a tip, which some places have laws against.\n\nSo, the bartender's initial action of adding 20% without asking is questionable. The author's response of 0% could be a justified reaction to that. However, in practice, the author might have been in the wrong if the customary expectation in that establishment is to tip, and their refusal caused a conflict. But if the bartender shouldn't have added the tip without permission, then the author's response is reasonable.\n\nIt's also possible that the author overreacted by not tipping at all, but the bartender's action of adding the tip without asking is the root issue here. If the author had simply adjusted the tip to a lower amount instead of 0%, maybe there wouldn't have been a confrontation. But the bartender's refusal to serve them is also problematic because it's their job to serve, regardless of the tip amount, unless the customer is being abusive.\n\nIn conclusion, the bartender's actions were inappropriate for adding a tip without consent, which could be the main issue. The author's response was a reaction to that, so they might not be in the wrong. However, the author could have handled it differently by perhaps adjusting the tip to 10% or 15% instead of 0%, avoiding the confrontation. But given the bartender's initial mistake, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. So the answer might be B (No).\n"
