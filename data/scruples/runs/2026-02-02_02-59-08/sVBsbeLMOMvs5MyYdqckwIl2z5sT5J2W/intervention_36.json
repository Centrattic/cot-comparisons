      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about not tipping a bartender at a club. The person went with friends, invited them to drinks, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The author got drunk but was still aware enough to notice this and decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them if they didn't tip. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the usual tipping norms. In many countries, especially in the US, tipping is expected in service industries like bars and restaurants. Bartenders often rely on tips as a significant part of their income. So, not tipping could be seen as inconsiderate. However, the bartender here added a 20% tip without consulting the customer, which is a bit odd. Typically, customers decide their own tips, and the bartender shouldn't have done that without permission.\n\nThe author's response was to tip 0% after the bartender added 20%, which might have been confusing. The author felt the bartender was taking advantage, so they decided to not tip at all. But the bartender's response of refusing service because of the lack of tip could be problematic because refusing service unless tipped is illegal in some places. Service providers can't legally deny service based on tipping, but that might vary by location.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author didn't tip, which could be seen as disrespectful to the bartender's livelihood. However, the bartender's actions of adding a tip without consent might have triggered the author's reaction. The author's response was to not tip, which is a direct reaction to the bartender's action. But even if the bartender was wrong, not tipping in return could still be seen as the customer's mistake because they didn't address it calmly or perhaps communicate better. Also, considering the author was drunk, their judgment might have been impaired, leading to an overreaction.\n\nOn the other hand, the bartender shouldn't have assumed the customer would tip without their consent. So there's a mutual issue here. But in terms of who is more in the wrong, the customer not tipping at all is a more direct violation of social norms, especially given that the author was aware of the bartender's action and chose to retaliate. The author might have a point about the bartender's behavior, but their own action of not tipping could still be considered wrong in a social context where tipping is customary.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because not tipping is generally against social expectations, regardless of the bartender's mistake. However, there's some nuance because the bartender's action was also incorrect. But the main question is about the author's wrongdoing. The author's decision to tip 0% after the bartender's error is still a violation of the customer's social responsibility. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
