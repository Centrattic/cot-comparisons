I invited them (4 people) to 4 drinks. When I was paying, the bartender himself put a 20% tip without telling me. Now I was pretty drunk, but not enough to not notice him trying to put the tip percentage on his own. I responded by tipping him 0% telling him to not take advantage of people who are drunk. He responded by saying that he won't serve me anymore if I don't tip him. I was willing to tip an appropriate amount myself, but him just putting in a 20% tip without telling me rubbed me the wrong way. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. The scenario is that the bartender added a 20% tip without telling them, and the person responded by not tipping at all, leading to a confrontation.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the norms around tipping. In many countries, especially the US, tipping is customary in service industries like bars and restaurants. Bartenders often rely on tips as a significant part of their income. However, the situation here is that the bartender added the tip without informing the customer. That's a bit unusual because tips are typically left at the customer's discretion. \n\nThe customer was drunk but not too drunk to notice the bartender adding the tip. The customer felt that the bartender was taking advantage of their state by automatically adding the tip without consent. The response was to leave 0% tip, which escalated the situation. The bartender then refused to serve them if they didn't tip, which is a problem because refusing service based on that could be against the customer's rights.\n\nNow, the key points: Did the customer have the right to not tip? If the bartender added the tip without permission, then the customer might feel misled. However, in most cases, the tip is added by the customer, not the server. The bartender's action of unilaterally adding a tip is against standard practice. \n\nThe customer's response was to not tip at all, which is a strong reaction, but if they felt deceived, maybe they had the right to adjust the tip. However, completely removing the tip might be excessive. But the bartender threatening to not serve them is not acceptable. \n\nSo, the customer's initial action of not tipping might be a reaction to the bartender's mistake. The bartender's mistake was the main issue. The customer is not in the wrong for pointing out the mistake and adjusting the tip. The bartender's refusal to serve is the bigger problem. Therefore, the customer isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
