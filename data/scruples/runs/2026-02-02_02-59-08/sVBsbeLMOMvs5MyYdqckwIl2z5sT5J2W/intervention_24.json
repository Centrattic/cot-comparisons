      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is at fault for not tipping the bartender. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, invited four people to drinks, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The author was drunk but not too much that they didn't notice. They responded by not tipping, arguing the bartender shouldn't take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them if they didn't tip.\n\nFirst, I need to consider standard tipping practices. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is expected for service staff, and 15-20% is common. However, some argue that if the tip is automatically added, it's a service charge and part of the total cost. But the key point here is that the bartender added the 20% without informing the customer. That could be an issue because the customer didn't have the chance to agree to it. \n\nThe author's response was to not tip at all, which is a zero tip. Normally, if someone adds a tip without consent, it's a form of overcharging, which is illegal in some places. However, in many cases, tips are supposed to be voluntary. If the bartender added the tip without asking, the customer might have a right to refuse. \n\nBut the author was drunk. While being drunk doesn't excuse rude behavior, it might have affected their judgment. The bartender's response of refusing service could be a policy issue. Restaurants and bars can set their own policies, but if a customer refuses to tip, the establishment might refuse service to protect their employees' earnings.\n\nThe author's argument is that the bartender shouldn't take advantage of a drunk person by adding a tip without consent. The bartender's argument is that he deserves a tip. The question is whether the author was wrong in their reaction.\n\nI think there's a gray area here. The bartender shouldn't add a tip unilaterally without informing the customer, which might be against the establishment's policy. However, the customer's response of not tipping at all was a form of protest, but it's possible they could have discussed it before refusing service. Refusing to tip entirely might not be the best approach, but the bartender's action of adding a tip without consent is questionable. \n\nConsidering all that, the author might not be entirely in the wrong, but their approach could have been better. However, since the question is whether they're in the wrong, and the bartender's action might be a policy violation, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong. But I'm a bit torn because refusing to tip can also be seen as disrespectful. However, given the bartender's initial mistake, the author's response might be justified. So I'm leaning towards answer B.\n"
