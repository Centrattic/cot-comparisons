      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the person who didn't tip their bartender is in the wrong. Here's what happened: they went to a club, invited four friends, and paid for four drinks. The bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The user, who was drunk but not too drunk to notice, decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them if they didn't tip. The user is asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around tipping. In many places, tipping is expected as part of service, especially in the US where bartenders often rely on tips for a significant portion of their income. However, the key point here is that the bartender added the 20% tip without the customer's knowledge or consent. Normally, tips are the customer's choice, so automatically adding one without asking might be problematic.\n\nThe user's response was to leave 0% and confront the bartender. They felt the bartender was taking advantage of their state (being drunk). The bartender's retaliation was to refuse service without a tip. This could be a breach of their right to serve, as the user is within their right to choose not to tip, though refusing service might be against the bartender's policies or even illegal in some areas.\n\nAnother angle: the user paid for drinks, so the transaction is complete. The tip is a separate matter. If the bartender added a tip without permission, that's essentially charging an extra fee, which the user rightfully objected to. However, the user's approach might have been confrontational. Maybe they should have first asked why the tip was added instead of immediately zeroing it out. But given the circumstances, the user's reaction could be seen as justified because they were being charged without consent.\n\nThe bartender's response of refusing service is more questionable. It's against the law in many places to refuse service in a public establishment unless there's a valid reason like intoxication, which isn't the case here. The user was drunk but not to the point of being a threat. So the bartender can't legally refuse service based on the tip amount.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the user was in a position where they didn't want to be charged a tip they didn't agree to. The bartender's automatic addition of the tip might be a policy, but if that's the case, it should be communicated to the customer. The user's zero tip might be seen as a reasonable response to an unauthorized fee. However, the user could have handled it more politely, but their right to choose the tip remains.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the user isn't in the wrong because they were objecting to an unauthorized charge. The bartender overstepped by adding the tip without consent and then refusing service. The user's actions, while perhaps blunt, were a reaction to the bartender's initial transgression.\n"
