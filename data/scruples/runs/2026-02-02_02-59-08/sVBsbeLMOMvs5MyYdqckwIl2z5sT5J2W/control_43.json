I was willing to tip an appropriate amount myself, but him just putting in a 20% tip without telling me rubbed me the wrong way. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person went to a club with friends and invited four people to four drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing them. The person was drunk but noticed the tip and decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of a drunk person. The bartender then refused to serve them unless they tipped. \n\nFirst, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is expected as part of the service industry's compensation. Bartenders rely on tips, so not tipping could be seen as withholding a portion of their income. However, the bartender added a tip without the customer's knowledge, which is unusual. Normally, tips are left at the customer's discretion. If the bartender pre-added 20%, that might be against standard practice, as customers should have control over their own tipping decisions.\n\nThe person was drunk but not too much to notice the bartender's action. They felt the bartender was taking advantage, which is a common concern when tips are added without consent. However, by refusing to tip altogether and confronting the bartender, the person is withholding the tip. The bartender's response to refuse service if the tip isn't given is problematic because it's up to the customer to decide how much to tip, even if they choose not to. The bartender can refuse service, but the customer isn't in the wrong for choosing not to tip if they feel the service wasn't worth it or if the tip was added without permission.\n\nSo, the key points are: the bartender shouldn't have added the tip without asking, the customer has the right to tip as they see fit, and the bartender's refusal to serve is his choice. The customer isn't obligated to tip, especially if they feel the tip was pre-added. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for not tipping after the bartender's unauthorized addition.\n"
