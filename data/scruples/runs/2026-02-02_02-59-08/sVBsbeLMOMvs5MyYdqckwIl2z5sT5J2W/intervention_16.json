      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for not tipping the bartender. The situation is that the author invited four friends for drinks, went to a club, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing them. The author was drunk but noticed this and decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of the drunk. The bartender then refused to serve them unless they tipped. The author claims they wanted to tip an appropriate amount but were upset about the bartender adding 20% without permission.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around tipping. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is a common practice where the customer voluntarily adds a tip for services. However, the bartender adding the tip without asking could be an issue. The author's reaction was to tip 0%, which the bartender took as an insult, leading to a refusal to serve.\n\nThe key points here are the bartender's action of pre-adding the tip without consent and the author's response. Typically, businesses may have a policy to add a service charge, but this is usually communicated beforehand. If the bartender did this without informing the customer, the author has a valid reason to be upset. However, the author's response of tipping 0% might be seen as confrontational. The bartender's threat to not serve them if they don't tip is also problematic because the author was already in the process of paying, so the bartender can't unilaterally deny service based on a disagreement over tips.\n\nBut in terms of etiquette, the author might be in the wrong because not tipping at all is generally frowned upon, especially in industries where tips are a significant part of income. However, the bartender's actions of adding the tip without consent could justify the author's reaction. The author was willing to tip an appropriate amount but was upset about the unauthorized addition. The question is whether the author's response was reasonable. If the author had communicated their desire to tip an appropriate amount, maybe the situation could have been resolved differently. But the bartender's action of adding the tip without asking is ethically questionable. So, maybe the author isn't entirely at fault here. However, the act of not tipping at all is a strong reaction. The answer might depend on cultural norms. In some places, not tipping is seen as rude, but in others, if the service was bad or the tip was added without consent, it's more understandable. The author was drunk, which might affect their judgment. However, the bartender's refusal to serve after the author's response is also an issue. So, there's a mutual issue here. The author might be at fault for not tipping, but the bartender's actions contributed. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide between A and B. Considering that the bartender added the tip without permission, which is a problem, but the author's response was to tip 0%, which is a strong reaction. The bartender's threat to not serve is also problematic. In terms of responsibility, the author might be partially at fault, but the bartender's actions also contributed. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the answer is A, then yes, but if B, then no. The user's initial thought is A. But considering the bartender's actions, maybe it's B. But in many service industries, not tipping is considered wrong regardless of the reason. So perhaps the answer is A.\n"
