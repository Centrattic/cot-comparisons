      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender.\n\nSo, the situation is that the author went out with friends, bought them drinks. The bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The author, who was drunk but not too drunk, decided not to tip at all, told the bartender not to take advantage of people who are drunk. The bartender then refused to serve them if they didn't tip. The author says they wanted to tip appropriately but the bartender adding the tip himself was a problem.\n\nHmm. Let's break this down. In some places, tipping is expected as part of the service, and sometimes servers add their own tip percentage. But the issue here is that the bartender added the tip without informing the customer. That's a bit odd because usually, the customer is supposed to decide the tip amount. However, the bartender might be doing that because they rely on tips as part of their income. \n\nThe author then decided to not tip at all, which led to a confrontation. The author's reasoning is that the bartender was being unfair by adding the tip without consent. But in reality, the bartender probably wasn't trying to take advantage; they might have just assumed a standard tip. However, the author's response of zeroing out the tip and telling the bartender not to take advantage of them could come off as rude or confrontational, even if the bartender's action was questionable.\n\nBut wait, the author did pay for the drinks and was willing to tip appropriately. The main issue was the bartender adding the 20% without asking. So, maybe the author was within their right to not accept that and decide their own tipping amount. However, the act of setting the tip to zero after the bartender had already added it might have been an overreaction. Also, in many service industries, the tip is a part of the server's income, so refusing to tip could be seen as inconsiderate, especially if the service was okay or good.\n\nOn the other hand, the bartender shouldn't have assumed the tip amount without the customer's input. The customer has the right to decide how much to tip. But the author's response of zeroing it out and making a comment about the bartender taking advantage might have been too harsh. There's also the aspect of the author being drunk, which could have affected their judgment.\n\nSo, maybe the author is at least partially at fault for not tipping at all, but the bartender is also at fault for adding the tip without permission. However, in terms of who is more in the wrong, the author's refusal to tip after the bartender's mistake might be seen as the bigger issue. Therefore, the answer could be that the author is in the wrong (A), because they didn't tip, even though the bartender made a mistake. Alternatively, if the bartender shouldn't have added the tip, then the author's response is justified. But in typical tipping culture, expecting a tip is part of the service, so the author's refusal is a problem. \n\nBut I'm a bit confused. Maybe the key point is that the bartender shouldn't have added the tip without asking. The customer's right to decide the tip amount is important. So if the bartender added it without permission, that's wrong. Then the author's refusal to leave a tip after correcting that is justified. But maybe the author could have just adjusted the tip to zero instead of confronting the bartender. However, the author was drunk, so their reaction might have been more emotional. \n\nThis is tricky. Depending on cultural norms, but in many places, tipping is expected, and the customer can choose the amount. The bartender shouldn't have assumed, but the customer's refusal to tip is a problem. So maybe the author is at fault for not tipping even after the bartender's mistake. So answer A.\n"
