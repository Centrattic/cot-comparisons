      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who didn't tip their bartender is in the wrong. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, invited four friends to drinks, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The author was drunk but noticed this and tipped 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then refused to serve them unless they tipped. The author is wondering if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider standard tipping practices. In many places, especially in the US, it's customary to tip service workers like bartenders around 15-20%. Bartenders often rely on tips as a significant part of their income since their base pay might be lower. So, if the bartender added 20% automatically, maybe they were following a common practice to make it easier for customers who might not tip otherwise. However, the key issue here is that the bartender didn't inform the customer before adding the tip. That could be a problem. If the customer didn't know the tip was being added, they might feel it's an overcharge or a lack of transparency.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was drunk but claims they weren't too drunk to notice the tip. They decided to tip 0% in response, which could be seen as retaliatory. The bartender then refused to serve them, which might be within their rights if the establishment has a policy requiring tips, but that's a different angle. The author's reasoning for not tipping was because the bartender \"took advantage\" of their state of being drunk. But by adding the tip without asking, maybe the bartender was trying to ensure they received payment, especially if they expected a certain service level.\n\nI need to weigh both sides. The bartender might have been following standard practice but didn't communicate the tip. The author, in response, withheld their own tip, which could be seen as unfair because the bartender provides a service regardless of the tip. However, the initial act of adding the tip without consent might have been the catalyst. If the establishment automatically adds a tip, that's part of their business model, but if the customer is unhappy, they might feel it's deceptive.\n\nBut in most cases, tipping is a voluntary gesture in many places, and if the customer chooses not to tip, even if the server added a default tip, it's their right. However, the author's response of 0% might be seen as a refusal to participate in the tipping culture, which could be seen as inconsiderate. The bartender's refusal to serve could be based on policy, but that's another aspect. The main question is whether the author is in the wrong for not tipping after the bartender added it. If the bartender added it without permission, then the author might have a point in being upset. But if the bartender was within their rights to add a tip (as some places do for service charges), then the author's response could be wrong.\n\nIn the US, tipping is customary and expected, so not tipping could be seen as rude. However, if the tip was added without the customer's knowledge, that's a breach of trust. The author's action might be justified if they felt misled. But from a societal norm perspective, refusing to tip is generally considered wrong unless there's poor service. Since the author didn't mention poor service, just the automatic tip, the expectation might lean towards the author being in the wrong for retaliating.\n"
