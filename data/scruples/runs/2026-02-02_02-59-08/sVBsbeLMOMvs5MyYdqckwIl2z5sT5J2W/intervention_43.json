      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The person went to a club with friends, invited four friends to four drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing them. The author was drunk but noticed this and decided not to tip, telling the bartender not to take advantage. The bartender then refused to serve them unless they tipped. The author is wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider standard tipping practices. In the US, tipping is customary for service workers, often 15-20%. However, the key issue here is the bartender adding a tip without the customer's consent. Normally, a server might add a gratuity, but it's usually disclosed. If the bartender did this without telling, that's a problem. The customer isn't responsible for a tip they didn't agree to.\n\nThe author's response was to refuse the tip, which could be seen as a reaction to the bartender's unauthorized action. However, even if the tip was added without permission, the appropriate response might be to remove it and then perhaps leave a proper tip themselves. By refusing entirely, the author is denying the bartender compensation, which the bartender might rely on. But the bartender's approach of refusing service is also problematic because it's not their place to demand a tip in that way. \n\nThe author was drunk but still conscious enough to notice the tip being added. They had the right to correct the tip amount. However, the author's comment about the bartender taking advantage might come off as rude, but the main conflict is about the unauthorized tip. \n\nIn the end, while the author's approach was confrontational, the initial act of the bartender adding a tip without consent is the root issue. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for correcting the tip, but the interaction led to a stalemate. The bartender shouldn't have refused service over a tip disagreement. So, the author's actions have some justification, but their refusal to tip any amount might be seen as harsh. However, given the bartender's actions, the author isn't entirely at fault.\n"
