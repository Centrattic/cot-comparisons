      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. Let me break down the details.\n\nSo, the situation is that the person went to a club with friends, invited four friends to four drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing them. The person was drunk but not too much to notice. They responded by tipping 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them anymore if they didn't tip. The author is asking if they're at fault here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around tipping. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is a common practice for services like bartending. It's often expected, though not mandatory. However, the key point here is that the bartender added the tip without asking. Normally, when you pay with a card, sometimes the system might automatically add a tip, but in a cash situation, the customer would physically hand over the tip. If the bartender added it without the customer's knowledge, that's a problem. The customer has the right to decide how much to tip, if anything, especially when they're aware of the service they received.\n\nThe author was drunk but not to the point of being unable to make the decision. They noticed the bartender adding the tip, which is a red flag. By responding with 0%, the author is essentially objecting to the bartender's unauthorized addition. The bartender then threatened not to serve them, which could be seen as an overreaction. Bartenders can't force someone to tip, and if the customer decides not to tip after being informed, that's their choice. However, threatening to not serve them might be a bit strong, but it's also within the bartender's right to refuse service if they feel disrespected.\n\nBut the main issue is whether the author was wrong. Tipping is a customer's choice, and the bartender shouldn't impose their own tip. The author's decision to not tip in response to the bartender's action could be justified as a reaction to being taken advantage of. However, the author's approach might come off as confrontational. Instead of directly tipping 0%, maybe they could have asked about the tip and then decided. But since they were in the moment and drunk, their reaction might be understandable.\n\nOn the other hand, the bartender's response of refusing service could be seen as a bit extreme. Still, the author initiated the conflict by not tipping. So, is the author in the wrong? They didn't tip, but the bartender added a tip without permission. The author's action was a response to the bartender's action. In terms of right and wrong, the bartender shouldn't have added the tip without consent, which is a problem. But the author's refusal to tip might be their prerogative. \n\nSo, the answer might hinge on whether the bartender's action was inappropriate. If the bartender added the tip without the customer's knowledge, that's the fault. The author's response, while perhaps rude, is a reaction to that. However, in some places, tipping is expected, and not tipping could be seen as rude regardless. But the unauthorized addition complicates things. \n\nI think the author isn't entirely in the wrong because the bartender shouldn't have added the tip. But the author could have handled it differently. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong, not about the best way to handle it. Since the bartender made the first wrong move by adding the tip without consent, the author's response, while perhaps not the most diplomatic, is a reaction to that. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
