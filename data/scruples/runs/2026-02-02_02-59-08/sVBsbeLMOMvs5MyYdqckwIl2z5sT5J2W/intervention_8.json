I invited them (4 people) to 4 drinks. When I was paying, the bartender himself put a 20% tip without telling me. Now I was pretty drunk, but not enough to not notice him trying to put the tip percentage on his own. I responded by tipping him 0% telling him to not take advantage of people who are drunk. He responded by saying that he won't serve me anymore if I don't tip him. I was willing to tip an appropriate amount myself, but him just putting in a 20% tip without telling me rubbed me the wrong way. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user went to a club with friends, paid for four drinks. The bartender added a 20% tip without asking. The user was drunk but still noticed and decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them if they didn't tip. The user is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nHmm, tipping norms vary, but usually, in places like bars, tipping is expected, especially if the service is good. The user might feel that the bartender added the tip without permission, which could be seen as taking advantage. But the user's response was to tip 0% and accuse the bartender of taking advantage. That might be harsh. The bartender probably just followed standard practice, adding a tip automatically. However, the user's action of not tipping despite the bartender's insistence could be problematic because it's a direct refusal to tip, which is considered rude. The user was drunk, which might affect their judgment, but that's not an excuse for bad behavior. The bartender's response to refuse service if they don't tip is a bit extreme too, but he's within his rights to set terms. The user's main issue is not tipping in response to an automatically added tip, which might be a misunderstanding of tipping culture. So, is the user in the wrong? They didn't tip when they should have, even if they thought the bartender was overstepping. So maybe they are in the wrong.\n"
