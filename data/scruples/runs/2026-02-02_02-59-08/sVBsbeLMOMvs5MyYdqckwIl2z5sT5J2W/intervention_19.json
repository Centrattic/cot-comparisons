      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, paid for four drinks, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The author was drunk but noticed it and decided to tip 0%, saying not to take advantage of people who are drunk. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them again if they didn't tip. The author is asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to think about standard tipping practices. In many places, especially in the US, it's customary to tip service workers like bartenders 15-20%. However, the twist here is that the bartender added a tip without consulting the customer. The author was upset about this, especially since they were already paying for four friends, which might mean the total was higher. Adding a tip on top could have made the author feel it was being taken advantage of, especially when they were drunk. \n\nBut then, when the author decided to tip 0%, the bartender refused to serve them. So, there's a conflict here. The author might feel that the bartender shouldn't have unilaterally added a tip, while the bartender might have been trying to follow standard practice and was upset when the customer refused. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, not tipping at all when in a restaurant or bar is generally seen as rude, even if there's a dispute. However, the bartender's action of adding a tip without permission might be the root of the problem. The author's response was to zero out the tip, which is a strong reaction. But if the bartender was adding it without consent, maybe the author had a right to correct that. However, refusing to tip any amount at all, even if the service was bad, is usually frowned upon. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of the bartender threatening not to serve them again. That's not uncommon in some places, as employees might enforce their own policies. However, the author might have been within their rights to not tip if they felt the tip was forced. \n\nIn many contexts, the customer is supposed to decide the tip amount. If the bartender added it without asking, that might be against some store's policies. But if the establishment automatically adds a tip, that's usually communicated beforehand. If the bartender did it on his own, that might be an issue. \n\nSo, the author's mistake might be not tipping at all, but the bartender's mistake was adding the tip without permission. However, the author's response was to tip 0%, which could be seen as wrong because they were the one making a choice in the end. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is at fault. If the bartender added the tip without consent, the author could argue that they have the right to adjust it. But if they then left zero, that's problematic. Maybe the appropriate action would have been to reduce the tip to a lower amount rather than zero. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because not tipping is usually considered rude, even if there's a reason. Unless the service was terrible, but in this case, the issue was the bartender adding the tip. However, the author could have adjusted the tip to a lower amount instead of zero. Therefore, the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
