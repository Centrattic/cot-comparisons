      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who didn't tip their bartender is at fault. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, invited four people for drinks, paid the bill, and noticed the bartender automatically added a 20% tip without informing them. The person was drunk but not too drunk to notice. They responded by tipping 0%, told the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people, and the bartender refused to serve them after that. The person is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around tipping. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary for service workers, and not tipping can be seen as rude or inconsiderate. However, the key point here is that the bartender added the tip without informing the customer. Normally, when a tip is added automatically by the system, it's called an \"auto-tip,\" but the customer is usually aware of it. If the bartender didn't communicate this, maybe the customer felt it was a form of deception or taking advantage.\n\nThe customer was drunk but not too drunk to notice. So they might have felt disoriented or mistrustful because of the alcohol, leading them to react strongly. The bartender's response of refusing service if they don't tip is also questionable. In some places, refusing service for not tipping could be illegal if the customer didn't agree to a tip beforehand. However, in others, it might be within the establishment's rights if tipping is part of their policy.\n\nThe person's argument is that the bartender shouldn't take advantage of drunk people. That's a valid concern. However, the customer's reaction was to tip 0%, which is a strong response. The question is whether the customer had the right to do that. If the bartender added the tip without consent, then the customer might be justified in not wanting to pay it. But tipping is generally a social expectation, so not tipping could be seen as inconsiderate regardless of the situation.\n\nAnother angle: the customer invited four friends for drinks, so maybe they were paying a large bill. The bartender adding a tip without asking could be an issue of transparency. However, if the customer didn't object to the service otherwise, just the tip, it's a bit of a gray area. The customer's reaction was to confront the bartender, which escalated the situation. The bartender then refused service, which might be against the law in some jurisdictions, but that's a separate issue.\n\nIn terms of morality, some might say the customer was within their rights to not pay an unrequested tip, especially if they felt it was unfair. However, others might argue that tipping is a social norm, and refusing to tip, even with a reason, is still inconsiderate. The fact that the customer was drunk might affect their judgment, but they still chose to act on it.\n\nSo, considering all these factors: the bartender's actions of adding a tip without communication could be a fault. The customer's reaction of not tipping and confronting the bartender might be justified if they felt misled, but not tipping at all is still against the norm. The bartender's refusal to serve could also be a problem. However, the main question is about the customer's fault. If the customer correctly identified an issue (unauthorized tip) and acted on it, they might not be in the wrong. But if tipping is expected and they refused without a valid reason, they might be. It's a bit of a toss-up, but leaning towards the customer being in the wrong because the norm is to tip, and even if the bartender was wrong, the appropriate action might be to discuss it later, not to refuse the tip and cause a conflict.\n"
