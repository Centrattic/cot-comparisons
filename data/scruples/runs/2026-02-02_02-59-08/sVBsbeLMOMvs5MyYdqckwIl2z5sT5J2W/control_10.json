      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender after the bartender added a 20% tip without permission. \n\nFirst, the setup: The author went to a club with friends, bought drinks for four people. The bartender added a 20% tip without informing the author. The author, who was drunk but not too drunk to notice, decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then refused to serve them if they didn't tip. The author was willing to tip an appropriate amount but was upset about the bartender's unauthorized tip.\n\nSo, the main issue here is the bartender adding a tip without the customer's consent. In many places, tipping is typically voluntary, and some establishments may automatically add a gratuity for large groups or certain services. However, the key point is whether the bartender informed the customer beforehand. If the bartender didn't mention it and just added it, that could be problematic. The author's response was to not tip, which the bartender took as an offense and then threatened to not serve them.\n\nLegally, in the US, for instance, it's legal to add a gratuity for groups of six or more, but the establishment should disclose this. Here, the group was four, so maybe the bartender didn't have the right to add a tip automatically. The author's action was to counteract what they saw as an unfair practice. However, refusing to tip at all might be seen as harsh, but the situation is more about the bartender's actions. \n\nThe author's mistake could be in not understanding that the bartender might have a policy to add tips regardless, and by not tipping, they caused a confrontation. But the bartender's action of adding the tip without consent is the root issue. The author might have a valid point in objecting to that, but their response of 0% tip could be seen as extreme. However, since the bartender didn't ask, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The bartender's response of refusing service is also problematic because in many places, you can't refuse service for not tipping unless it's a private club or similar. \n\nSo weighing both sides: the bartender's unauthorized addition led to the conflict. The author's refusal to tip could be justified as a response to the unauthorized action. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong here. The answer is B.\n"
