      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The situation is about tipping a bartender at a club. The user went with friends, invited four people to four drinks, which I assume means they paid for the first four drinks for each friend. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing the user. The user was drunk but could still notice this and decided to not tip, telling the bartender not to take advantage of people who are drunk. The bartender then refused to serve them if they didn't tip. The user is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for not tipping.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around tipping. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is expected in service industries like bars and restaurants, typically around 15-20%. However, the user is upset because the bartender added the tip without asking. Normally, when you pay with a card, the tip is sometimes pre-selected, but the customer can adjust it. The user might feel that the bartender was taking initiative without their consent, which could be seen as overstepping. \n\nBut the bartender's job often relies on tips, so not tipping could be seen as unfair, especially if the user was served. The fact that the user was drunk might factor in, but being drunk doesn't usually excuse not tipping. The user's response of 0% could be a reaction to the bartender's action, but refusing to tip in that case could lead to the bartender refusing service, which is within their rights in some places. \n\nAnother angle: if the user was paying for multiple friends, maybe the total was higher, and the tip would be a significant amount. The user might feel that the bartender was taking advantage of their impaired state. But again, the expectation of tipping is a cultural norm. The user's argument is that the bartender shouldn't assume the tip amount without permission. However, in many places, even if a tip is automatic, you can adjust it. The user might have been able to change it if they didn't want to pay 20%. \n\nThe bartender's response of refusing service if they don't tip is a bit strong. In some places, employees can't legally refuse service for not tipping, but it might be a matter of policy. The user's actions could be seen as a stand against automatic tips, but if they were willing to tip an appropriate amount themselves, maybe they didn't do it because of the way the bartender added the tip. \n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? It depends on the context. If the user was served, the expectation of a tip is there. Even if the bartender added it without asking, the user could still adjust it. The user's decision to not tip at all and to confront the bartender might be seen as rude, especially since the bartender's job depends on tips. However, the bartender's action of adding the tip without permission could be the initial wrong. \n\nBut the user is the one who didn't leave a tip, which is what the situation is about. Even if they were upset, not tipping is against the norm, so the user is likely in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
