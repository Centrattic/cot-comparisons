      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not tipping their bartender. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, bought them four drinks, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing them. The author was drunk but not too drunk to notice, so they decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then refused to serve them unless they tipped. The author thinks they might be in the wrong (AITA), but the question is whether they actually are.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key elements here. Tipping practices can vary by country and establishment. In the US, for example, tipping is customary for service staff, often around 15-20%, and sometimes employers take that into account for wages. However, the bartender in this case added the tip without the customer's knowledge. The customer then decided to remove the tip, which led to a confrontation.\n\nThe author's reasoning was that the bartender shouldn't take advantage of a drunk person. But was the bartender's action of adding the tip without asking appropriate? Or is it standard for some places to automatically add a tip to tab? I need to consider that. If the establishment has a policy where a service charge is added, that's different from an individual employee adding it without the customer's consent. If the latter, that could be problematic.\n\nThe author's response was to zero out the tip, which is a direct refusal. The bartender then threatened not to serve them. Now, the ethical question here is who has the right stance. The author's action was a reaction to what they perceived as manipulation. However, in many places, tipping is expected, and not tipping can be seen as disrespectful to the service staff. But if the bartender added the tip without informing the customer, that's an issue of transparency.\n\nAnother angle is the customer's state of being drunk. If someone is intoxicated, their ability to make rational decisions might be impaired, but the bartender is in a position of responsibility. Adding a tip without consent could be seen as exploiting that vulnerability. However, the customer's decision to not tip could be seen as inconsiderate to the bartender's earnings.\n\nI should also think about the social norms. In some cultures, automatic gratuities are added to large groups or for certain services, and that's communicated upfront. If this was a regular practice here without informing customers, that's a problem. The author's action was a protest against that, which might be justified if the practice is deceitful. But if it's a standard practice, then the author's refusal could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nAdditionally, the bartender's response of refusing service if they don't tip is a bit strong. The bartender could remove the tip and then serve, but instead chose to escalate the situation. That might indicate that the employee was overstepping their authority. The customer has the right to choose their tipping amount, even if it's zero, especially if the tip was added without consent.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's action could be seen as a justified reaction to an employee's unauthorized action. The bartender shouldn't have added the tip without informing the customer, and the customer's refusal to accept that could be in their rights. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong. However, the expectation of tipping in the service industry is a cultural norm, so there's a counter-argument that the author should have tipped regardless. But since the tip was added by the bartender without consent, the author's response is a matter of standing up for their right to control their own payments. So the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
