      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for not tipping their bartender.\n\nSo the scenario is: They went to a club with friends, bought 4 drinks for them. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling the person. The person was drunk but still noticed and decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage. The bartender then refused to serve them unless they tipped. The person is questioning if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider standard tipping etiquette. In many places, especially in service industries like bars and restaurants, tipping is customary and expected. It's part of the server's income. So if the bartender added a 20% tip, maybe that's a standard gratuity, which some establishments do automatically for large groups or certain payments. However, the key point here is that the bartender did it without informing the customer. That's probably where the conflict started. The customer felt it was unfair because they weren't consulted, especially when they were part-drunk but still coherent.\n\nThe person's response was to tip 0%, which could be seen as a protest against the bartender's action. But when the bartender refused to serve unless they tipped, the customer was in a bind. The question is whether the customer was in the wrong for not tipping.\n\nNow, from a typical etiquette standpoint, even if the tip was added without consent, not tipping at all is usually frowned upon. Servers rely on tips, and refusing to tip entirely could be seen as inconsiderate. However, the bartender's action of adding a tip without informing the customer is also questionable. Some places do add gratuity for groups, but it's standard practice to inform customers first. The customer's reaction might be justified if the bartender violated the establishment's usual policies.\n\nBut then, the customer's choice to tip 0% as a form of protest might be too harsh. Even if the bartender made a mistake, the customer could have addressed it differently, like asking to adjust the tip after the fact. Refusing to tip entirely and then getting refused service could place the blame on the customer for not following the service norms, even if the bartender was wrong in their initial action.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the customer might be in the wrong because they didn't handle the situation appropriately, even though the bartender's action was also a mistake. The customer's response was extreme and led to a conflict where service was denied. Tipping is expected, and not tipping at all, regardless of the reason, is usually considered wrong. Therefore, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
