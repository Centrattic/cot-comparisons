      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. The situation involves the author and friends going to a club, inviting four friends to four drinks each. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without asking. The author, who was drunk but not too drunk to notice, decided to leave a 0% tip, telling the bartender not to take advantage of people who are drunk. The bartender then refused to serve them if they didn't tip. The author is now asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the standard tipping culture, especially in the US where tipping is common and expected in service industries like bars and restaurants. Typically, a 15-20% tip is the norm. If the bartender added a 20% tip without asking, that's called an automatic gratuity, which some places do, especially if the party is large. However, the key issue here is that the bartender didn't inform the customer beforehand. The author might feel that the bartender was taking advantage of their possibly impaired state to add the tip without consent.\n\nBut from the bartender's perspective, if the establishment has a policy of adding a gratuity for large parties, it's standard practice. If the bartender didn't mention it, maybe he made a mistake, but the author's reaction could be seen as confrontational. The author's response of 0% tip after the bartender had already added 20% might be aggressive. Also, the author was drunk, which might have influenced their judgment, but they claim they weren't too drunk to notice the tip being added.\n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong depends on whether they should have tipped despite the bartender's mistake. If the bartender added the tip on his own without the establishment's policy, then the author might have a point in refusing to pay twice. But if the bartender was following standard practice (like adding a tip for large groups), then the author's refusal could be seen as rude or inconsiderate.\n\nAlso, the bartender threatening not to serve them is a bit aggressive, but it's not uncommon for service staff to enforce tipping policies. However, refusing service might be within the establishment's rights, but the approach taken by the bartender could be unprofessional.\n\nSo, the author's actions might be considered inconsiderate, especially if the tip was standard. But the bartender's approach of adding the tip without informing the customer is also questionable. The author's right to refuse the tip if they felt it was unauthorized is a point in their favor. However, the confrontation and refusal to tip could be seen as disrespecting the service staff's work, which is part of the tipping culture.\n\nIn conclusion, it's a bit of a gray area. The author might not be entirely wrong if the bartender didn't follow proper procedure, but their response could be seen as inconsiderate. The answer might depend on local customs and whether the bartender had the authority to add the tip without informing the customer. If the establishment doesn't have a policy of automatic tips, the author has a valid point. If it's standard, then the author's refusal is the issue.\n"
