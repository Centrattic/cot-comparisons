      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who didn't tip the bartender is in the wrong. The situation is that the person went to a club with friends, invited four friends to drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing them. The person was drunk but still noticed and decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then refused to serve unless they tipped. The question is if the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider tipping norms. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary for service workers. Bartenders usually rely on tips for a significant portion of their income. So, normally, leaving a tip is expected. However, the key point here is that the bartender added the tip himself without telling the customer. That's unusual. Normally, the customer decides the tip amount, either manually or through a preset option. The bartender's action of adding 20% without permission might be problematic. The customer felt this was taking advantage, especially since they were drunk. The customer then decided not to tip, leading to the bartender refusing service.\n\nNow, was the customer wrong? Well, if the bartender added a tip without permission, that's not standard practice. The customer's response to not tip in return could be a reaction to this. However, the customer could have addressed it by removing the tip or clarifying the amount. Instead, they left zero, which might be seen as retaliatory. But the bartender's action was the initial issue. The customer's decision to not tip after being forced into a 20% might be justified as a response. However, refusing to tip entirely could be seen as harsh, but if the bartender was wrong in adding it without consent, maybe the customer isn't wrong. \n\nBut in some places, pre-authorizing tips is illegal unless agreed upon. So the bartender might have broken rules by adding it. Therefore, the customer's reaction could be a valid response to the bartender's mistake. But the customer's refusal to tip might have been the wrong action regardless. The question is whether the customer is in the wrong for not tipping in response to the bartender's unauthorized tip. \n\nConsidering all angles, the bartender's action was the initial problem. The customer's response, while perhaps impulsive, was a reaction to being taken advantage of. So the answer might be B, the customer is not in the wrong. But some might argue that not tipping at all is wrong regardless. However, given the bartender's unauthorized action, the customer might have a valid point. So I think the answer is B.\n"
