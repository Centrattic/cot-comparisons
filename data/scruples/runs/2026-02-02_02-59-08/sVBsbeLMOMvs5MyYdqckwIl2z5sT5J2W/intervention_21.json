      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. The author went to a club with friends, invited them to four drinks each. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling the author. The author was drunk but not too drunk to notice. They then tipped 0% and told the bartender not to take advantage of people who are drunk. The bartender responded by refusing to serve them, and the author considered tipping themselves but felt the bartender's action was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the typical tipping norms. In the US, for example, a common tip is 15-20%, especially in service industries like bartending. If the bartender added a 20% tip automatically, maybe that's part of the club's policy. However, the key issue here is that the bartender didn't inform the author before adding the tip. The author's reaction was to deduct the 20% and tip 0%, which led to a conflict.\n\nSo, the author is arguing that the bartender shouldn't assume they would tip, especially when the customer is drunk. The bartender's response of refusing service if not tipped seems harsh, but maybe he's in a situation where tips are a significant part of his income. However, the author's mistake could be not tipping at all. Even if the automatic tip was a problem, a better approach might have been to correct the tip amount to something appropriate (like 15%) rather than zero. \n\nBut there's another angle. If the bartender added the tip without telling the author, that's a problem. The author might not have agreed to that, and the bartender shouldn't unilaterally add a tip. So the author's objection is valid. However, responding by not tipping at all might be seen as retaliatory and against the service expectations. Even if the tip was added without consent, the author still had the choice to leave an appropriate tip themselves. By not tipping, they're making the bartender lose all his tip, which could be considered wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, the bartender shouldn't pressure the customer into tipping. Service industry employees should be paid by their employer, and tips are a supplement, not a requirement. If the bartender is refusing service because of a tip, that's a separate issue. The author might not be in the wrong for not tipping if they felt the automatic addition was unfair, but the act of not tipping at all could be seen as inconsiderate, especially in a setting where tipping is expected.\n\nSo, the author could be in the wrong for not tipping, even if the bartender's action was questionable. Alternatively, the author might have a valid point about the tip being added without consent. The answer depends on cultural norms and the specific situation. But since the user thinks the author is in the wrong, maybe the answer is A. But I need to check if the bartender's action is acceptable. If the club automatically adds a tip and the bartender did that, maybe the author should have known. But if the bartender did it on his own without informing, then it's his fault. The author's response of not tipping at all might be the wrong move, regardless of the bartender's initial mistake. Therefore, the author is at least partially in the wrong. So answer A.\n"
