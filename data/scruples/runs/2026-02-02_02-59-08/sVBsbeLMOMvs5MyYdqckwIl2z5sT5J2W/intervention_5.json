      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. So, the scenario is that the author went to a club with friends, bought them four drinks. The bartender added a 20% tip without informing the author. The author, who was a bit drunk but not too drunk, responded by not tipping at all and told the bartender not to take advantage. The bartender then refused to serve them if they didn't tip. The author argues they were willing to tip appropriately but didn't like the bartender adding it without asking.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms regarding tipping. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary for service staff. However, the key point here is that the bartender added the tip without the customer's consent. Normally, a tip is left at the customer's discretion. If the bartender had the authority to add a tip unilaterally, that could be an issue. Some places have automatic gratuities for large parties or certain services, but maybe the customer wasn't informed, which is problematic.\n\nThe author was drunk but still conscious of the bartender's action. Their response was to leave 0%, which might be seen as a direct reaction to the bartender's unauthorized addition. However, refusing to tip entirely could be seen as harsh. The author might have felt disrespected by the bartender's action, but the way they handled it could be problematic. \n\nThe bartender's response of refusing service might be within his rights if the establishment has a tipping policy, but if he's acting beyond that, like threatening the customer, that's another issue. However, the question is about the author's actions. \n\nOn one hand, the bartender shouldn't impose a tip without consent. On the other, the author's retaliation by not tipping at all could be seen as excessive. The author might have a point in objecting to the unauthorized tip, but the response of leaving nothing might be too harsh, especially if the bartender is relying on tips for income. \n\nThe author's argument is that they wanted to tip appropriately but didn't like the imposition. However, the appropriate action would be to clarify the policy beforehand or dispute the tip amount, not to retaliate by not tipping. The author's behavior might be seen as inconsiderate because they're withholding payment that the bartender expects. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because they chose to not tip at all after the bartender made a mistake. The right approach would be to address the issue politely, perhaps by removing the unauthorized tip but still leaving an appropriate amount. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
