      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're at fault for not tipping the bartender. So the situation is they went to a club with friends, invited four friends for drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without asking. The person was drunk but noticed this and decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of someone who's drunk. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them if they didn't tip. The person feels they wanted to tip an appropriate amount themselves but were upset the bartender just added the tip without consent.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider the usual tipping practices. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is expected for services like bartending. But typically, the customer is supposed to decide the tip amount. Here, the bartender added the tip without informing the customer. That might be an issue because the customer has the right to decide how much to tip. However, sometimes places do add a service charge, but they usually disclose that upfront. If the bartender did this without telling, maybe the customer is within their rights to object.\n\nThe customer was drunk but not too drunk to notice the action. They responded by not tipping and confronting the bartender. The bartender then refused service. But can the bartender refuse service just because someone didn't tip? I think in many places, businesses can't just refuse service over a tip, especially if the customer doesn't want to pay more than the service charge. But maybe there's some policy here. Also, if the customer left the money, maybe the bartender was just trying to ensure they got their usual tip. But the key point is that the customer was forced to tip without being asked, which might be a breach of their autonomy.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the bartender added the tip without consent, which the customer rightly noticed. The customer's response was to not tip and tell the bartender not to take advantage. That seems justified. The bartender then refused service, which might be an overreaction. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they were objecting to an unauthorized tip. However, maybe the expectation is that if you're in a place where tipping is standard, you should tip regardless. But if the bartender didn't ask and just added it, the customer had a right to refuse. \n\nAnother angle: if the bartender is an independent contractor, maybe they rely on tips. But the customer's argument is about autonomy. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. They had the right to decide their own tip amount. So the answer would be B for No.\n"
