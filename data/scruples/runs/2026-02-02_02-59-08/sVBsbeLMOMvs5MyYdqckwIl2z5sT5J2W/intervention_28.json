      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who didn't tip their bartender is in the wrong. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, invited four friends to four drinks each. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The person was drunk but noticed it and then decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then refused to serve them unless they tipped. The user is asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the usual tipping norms. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is expected for service staff like bartenders. The standard is usually 15-20%. If the bartender added a 20% tip automatically, that might be part of the establishment's policy. But the issue here is that the bartender didn't inform the customer before adding the tip. That could be a problem because customers generally expect to be informed if a tip is being added, especially if they want to adjust it. So the bartender's action of adding it without asking might be the first issue.\n\nThen, the customer's reaction. They were drunk but not too drunk to notice, and they decided to tip 0%. They told the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then refused service unless they tipped. The customer's argument is that they wanted to tip an appropriate amount themselves, but the bartender's action of adding the tip without consent was wrong.\n\nNow, thinking about this, the customer might have overreacted. Even if the tip was added without their knowledge, the appropriate response would be to adjust the tip to their desired amount. By setting it to 0%, they're essentially not tipping at all, which could be seen as inconsiderate. Bartenders rely on tips as part of their income, so refusing to tip entirely might be seen as wrong. However, the bartender's action of adding the tip without permission is also questionable. If the policy is to add a tip, it should be communicated to the customer.\n\nSo, who is at fault here? The customer's action of leaving 0% could be seen as wrong because they didn't tip at all, which goes against the norm. But the bartender's action of adding the tip without informing them is also a problem. However, the customer had the chance to correct the tip amount once they noticed. Instead, they chose 0%, which is not a typical response. The customer might argue that they were being taken advantage of, but in a typical scenario, the right move would be to adjust the tip to a lower amount rather than zero. Therefore, the customer is in the wrong because they didn't tip at all after the initial mistake, even if the bartender was also at fault for not informing them.\n"
