      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not tipping the bartender after he added a 20% tip without telling them. They were drunk but still noticed the added tip and refused to pay it, leading to the bartender threatening not to serve them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the standard tipping norms. In many places, especially in the US, a 15-20% tip is common for services like bartending. However, the key issue here is whether the bartender had the right to add the tip unilaterally. Typically, the customer has control over the tip amount. If the bartender added it without the customer's knowledge or consent, that could be problematic. Some places might allow automatic gratuities for large groups or in certain situations, but the customer should be informed.\n\nThe user was drunk but not incapacitated, so they could still make decisions. They felt the bartender was taking advantage by adding the tip without permission. The bartender's response of refusing service if the tip wasn't paid seems extreme. Refusing service because a tip isn't given might be against the law in some places, as the tip is a customer's choice and not a mandatory fee. However, if the bartender refused service for another reason, that's a different matter. But in this case, the refusal was due to the tip, which complicates things.\n\nThe user's reasoning is that they wanted to tip appropriately on their own. If the bartender had just asked or informed them that their shift requires a tip, maybe the user would have adjusted. But since the tip was added without consent, the user felt it was a manipulation tactic. \n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? Well, the bartender shouldn't have added the tip without consent, which might have been the initial issue. The user's refusal to pay a forced tip could be justified. However, the user's response of tipping 0% might be seen as going too far, even if the bartender was wrong to add the tip. But in many places, tips are discretionary, so the user has the right to choose. The bartender's refusal to serve them might be the bigger issue here, as they can't force a customer to pay a tip. \n\nTherefore, the user might not be in the wrong for refusing to pay the added tip. The bartender's actions were inappropriate, so the user has a valid reason for their response.\n"
