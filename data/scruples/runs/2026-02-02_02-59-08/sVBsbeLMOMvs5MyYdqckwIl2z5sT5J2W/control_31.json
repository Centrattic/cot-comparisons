      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who didn't tip their bartender is in the wrong. The situation is that the group went to a club, the person invited four friends for drinks, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing them. The person was drunk but not too much to notice, so they decided to leave 0% and told the bartender not to take advantage of people who are drunk. The bartender then refused to serve them unless they tipped. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider standard tipping practices. In many places, especially in the US, it's customary to tip service workers like bartenders around 15-20%. However, the key point here is that the bartender added the tip without the customer's knowledge or consent. Normally, when you pay with a card, the tip is added at the customer's discretion. If the bartender unilaterally added 20%, that might be against the norm. However, some establishments do automatically add a tip, especially in places where service charges are common, like restaurants with large parties or certain bars. \n\nThe customer was drunk but not too impaired to notice. They responded by leaving 0%, which could be seen as a protest against the bartender's action. The bartender then refused service, which might be a bit harsh. Refusing to serve someone because they didn't tip could be problematic, as tipping is a customer's choice, though expected in many contexts. However, the bartender might have a policy to enforce a minimum tip, which could be part of the establishment's rules.\n\nNow, the user's actions: they didn't tip, possibly out of protest. The bartender tried to enforce a tip. The user might argue that the bartender shouldn't have added the tip without consent, so their response was justified. The bartender's response of refusing to serve them could be seen as inappropriate because it's against the customer's right to choose their tip, even if it's 0%, unless the establishment has a strict policy. \n\nBut wait, if the bartender is an employee, he can't legally refuse service on behalf of the establishment unless there's a clear policy in place. So if the bar doesn't allow tipping decisions to be made by the bartender, then the bartender overstepped. Alternatively, if the bar has a policy that requires a minimum tip, then the customer might be wrong for not complying. However, the user didn't know about a policy, so it's unclear. \n\nThe user's reasoning is that the bartender shouldn't take advantage of someone who's drunk. The user might feel disrespected by the bartender's action of adding a tip without consent. On the other hand, the bartender might have thought that the user wouldn't notice because they were drunk and wanted to ensure they left a tip. \n\nIn terms of social norms, tipping is a personal choice, and while it's expected, not tipping is a choice that might make others upset, but it's not necessarily wrong unless there's a specific policy. The user's action could be seen as a stand against the bartender's assumption, which might be reasonable. However, the response of the bartender to refuse service could be more problematic because it's up to the customer to decide the tip, not the server. \n\nSo, considering all that, the user might not be in the wrong because they were reacting to the bartender adding the tip without consent. The bartender's refusal to serve them could be the bigger issue here. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
