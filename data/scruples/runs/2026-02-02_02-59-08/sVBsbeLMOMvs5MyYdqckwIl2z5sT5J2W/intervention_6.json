      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, invited four of them, and had four drinks each. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing the person. The person was drunk but not too drunk to notice this. They responded by not tipping at all, told the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people, and the bartender then refused to serve them. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but is seeking confirmation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the standard tipping practices. In many places, especially in the service industry, a 15-20% tip is customary. If the bartender added the tip without asking, maybe that's an assumption based on common practice. However, the issue here is that the author wasn't informed that a tip was being added. Typically, when a server adds a tip automatically, they might do it at the register without consulting the customer, which could be seen as their prerogative. But the author felt it was an advantage taken, especially since they were drunk. \n\nThe author's response was to not tip at all, which could be seen as a direct retaliation. The bartender's response was to refuse service, which is a bit extreme. However, the author's action of removing the tip entirely might be considered rude or ungrateful, especially if the bartender was just following standard practice. \n\nOn the other hand, the bartender didn't ask if the author wanted to add a tip, which might be part of the problem. If the author had the ability to adjust the tip, they might have preferred to set their own amount. The fact that the bartender tried to add a tip without communication could be the root of the conflict. \n\nBut in most cases, when you pay with a card, the register might have a default tip percentage, and the customer can adjust it. If the author didn't adjust it, the tip would go through. If the author manually set it to 0%, that's their choice. However, the author's response to the bartender's action was confrontational, which might have been unnecessary. \n\nThe key points are: the bartender added a tip without asking, the author removed it entirely, leading to a conflict. The author was drunk but not too drunk to notice, which complicates the situation. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might be in the wrong for not tipping at all, as tipping is expected for good service. However, the bartender's action of adding a tip without communication could be part of the issue. The author's response might be seen as inconsiderate, but the bartender's refusal to serve could be excessive. \n\nConsidering standard practices, the author is expected to tip. If they felt the automatic tip was unwarranted, they could have adjusted it to a lower percentage. Choosing 0% might be seen as inconsiderate, so the author is in the wrong.\n"
