      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not tipping their bartender. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe person went to a club with friends, invited 4 people to 4 drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without asking. The person was drunk but noticed this and tipped 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them anymore if they didn't tip. The person says they were willing to tip an appropriate amount but the bartender adding the tip without permission annoyed them. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I should recall general tipping norms. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is expected in service industries like bars and restaurants. The standard is often around 15-20%, but this can vary. However, the key point here is that the bartender added the tip without the customer's knowledge or consent. Normally, when you pay with a card, the tipping is done at the customer's discretion, either by selecting a percentage or adding cash. If the bartender unilaterally added 20%, that's unusual because it's the customer's choice, not the employee's.\n\nSo the customer noticed this and decided to tip 0%, arguing against the bartender's action. The bartender then threatened not to serve them unless they tipped. The customer claims they were willing to tip an appropriate amount but didn't want the bartender to take advantage of their state (being drunk).\n\nNow, from a customer's perspective, being forced to tip by an employee is not typical. Normally, the business as a whole relies on tips, but individual employees shouldn't enforce it. If the bartender is refusing service because of a tip, that's a problem because the customer has the right to choose how much to tip. However, the customer's action of tipping 0% after the bartender added a tip might be seen as retaliatory. But the bartender shouldn't have added the tip without permission in the first place.\n\nAnother angle: when the customer paid, the bartender added the tip without asking. The customer, even if drunk, noticed this and decided to tip nothing. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them. The business might have policies about tipping, but the employee shouldn't be the one enforcing it through threats. The bartender's response could be unprofessional or even against company policy. \n\nSo, the customer's main issue was that the bartender added a tip without consent. The customer's response was to tip 0%, which is within their right, even if it's not customary. However, the customer's comment about the bartender not taking advantage of a drunk person might be a bit harsh if the bartender had no intention of doing so. But the key point is the unauthorized addition of the tip. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the bartender's actions were inappropriate because they took control of the tipping process without the customer's input. The customer, while perhaps being a bit confrontational, was correcting what they perceived as a wrong. However, the customer did have the right to choose not to tip, especially if they felt the service wasn't worth it, but in this case, the issue was the bartender's unilateral action. \n\nSo, is the customer the one in the wrong? Well, the bartender's actions were at fault for adding the tip without permission. The customer's response, while possibly not the most diplomatic, was a reaction to that. The customer was not obligated to tip, but the way the situation escalated might have been avoidable. However, the initial fault lies with the bartender. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong), because the bartender shouldn't have added the tip without asking, and the customer was within their rights to tip as they saw fit. However, some might argue that the customer should have just gone along with the 20% to avoid conflict, but the customer's objection is valid. So, the customer is not in the wrong.\n"
