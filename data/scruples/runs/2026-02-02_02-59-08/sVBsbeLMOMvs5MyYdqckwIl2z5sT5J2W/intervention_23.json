He responded by saying that he won't serve me anymore if I don't tip him. I was willing to tip an appropriate amount myself, but him just putting in a 20% tip without telling me rubbed me the wrong way.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person went to a club with friends, invited four friends to four drinks. So maybe they ordered multiple rounds? When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without asking. The person was drunk but noticed and decided to leave 0% instead, arguing the bartender shouldn't take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then refused to serve them if they didn't tip.\n\nFirst, tipping norms. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is expected for service, especially in bars and restaurants. Bartenders rely on tips as part of their income. Automatically adding a tip is sometimes done in businesses, but maybe it's not common in all places. If the bartender didn't inform the customer, that could be an issue. However, the customer's response was to leave zero tip, which might be seen as retaliatory.\n\nThe person's argument is that the bartender shouldn't take advantage of drunk patrons. But being drunk doesn't necessarily mean you can't make a choice to tip. If the person was capable of noticing the tip and choosing to not tip, then maybe they had the capacity to make that decision. However, the bartender's action of adding the tip without consent could be seen as a mistake. But the customer's response was to not tip at all, which might be harsh. Also, the bartender's refusal to serve them could be a policy thing, but threatening not to serve might be extreme.\n\nIs the person in the wrong? If tipping is expected, and they refused to tip, even if the bartender made a mistake, then they might be in the wrong. However, if the bartender forced the tip without consent, that's also a problem. The key here is whether the customer had the right to remove the tip. If the bartender added it without permission, maybe the customer was justified in removing it. But then adding zero might be seen as rude. Alternatively, maybe the customer should have left some tip, even if they were upset.\n\nThe person's actions might be inconsiderate towards the bartender's income, even if they were upset. So maybe the answer is A, they're in the wrong. But some might argue that the bartender shouldn't have added the tip without consent. But in many cases, tips are left to the customer's discretion. If the bartender added it as a default, the customer can adjust. However, leaving zero is a strong response. So balancing both sides, the person might be at fault for not tipping, even if they had a reason.\n"
