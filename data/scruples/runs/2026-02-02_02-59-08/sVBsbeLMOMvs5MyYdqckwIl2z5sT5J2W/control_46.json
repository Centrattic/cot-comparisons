      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who didn't tip the bartender is in the wrong. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, ordered drinks, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without asking. The person got drunk but wasn't too drunk to notice, so they tipped 0% and told the bartender not to take advantage. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them if they didn't tip. The user is asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to recall standard tipping norms. In many places, especially in the US, a 15-20% tip is customary for service workers like bartenders. However, the key point here is that the bartender added the tip without informing the customer. That's a bit iffy because typically, the customer should have control over the tip amount. If the bartender just added it without asking, maybe that's where the issue is.\n\nThe customer was drunk but not too drunk to notice. So they were aware enough to respond. They decided to tip 0%, which is against the usual practice, but maybe their reasoning was that the bartender shouldn't have added the tip without permission. The bartender then refused to serve them, which is a problem because businesses can't just refuse service for not tipping, right? That could be illegal in some places, like a refusal of service based on non-tipping could be against the law, as tips are supposed to be voluntary.\n\nBut the question is about whether the customer is in the wrong. The customer didn't tip, but the bartender added the tip without asking. The customer's action was a reaction to that. So maybe the bartender overstepped by adding the tip without consent. The customer's response, while perhaps not in line with tipping norms, was a reaction to the bartender's action. However, the customer could have just removed the tip instead of setting it to 0. But the customer's argument was that the bartender was taking advantage of someone who was drunk. However, the customer was present and able to make that decision, so maybe they still had the agency here.\n\nAnother angle: in some places, automatic gratuities are added for large groups or events, but this was a group of four, which might not qualify. The bartender might have added it on their own. If the customer didn't want to tip, that's their choice, but refusing to tip could lead to a conflict. The bartender's response of refusing service might be the wrong part here, as tips are voluntary, and a business can't force a customer to tip, even if they're upset.\n\nSo, the customer's action was to not tip after the bartender added a tip without consent. The customer's argument is valid because the bartender shouldn't have added a tip without permission. The customer's response, while perhaps not the most polite, might be justified. The bartender's refusal to serve them is also problematic because they can't force a tip. So, in this case, the customer might not be in the wrong because the bartender acted improperly by adding the tip without consent. Therefore, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
