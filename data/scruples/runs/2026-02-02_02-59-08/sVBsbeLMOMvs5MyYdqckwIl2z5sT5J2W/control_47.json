      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're at fault for not tipping the bartender. Here's the situation: They went to a club with friends, invited four people for drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The person got drunk but noticed and decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then refused to serve them unless they tipped. The person says they were willing to tip an appropriate amount but were upset that the bartender added the tip without permission.\n\nSo, first thought: Tipping is a common practice in many service industries, especially in the US where servers and bartenders often rely on tips. If the bartender added a 20% tip without asking, maybe that's not standard. Wait, some places do have automatic gratuities for large groups or special occasions, but the user didn't know about it. However, the user's response was to tip 0%, which is unusual. The bartender threatened to not serve them if they didn't tip. \n\nIs the bartender's action of adding a tip without permission acceptable? Maybe not. Typically, if an establishment adds a gratuity, they should inform the customer. So the user might have a point in being upset. But the user's response was to give 0%, which could be seen as rude or disrespectful. However, the user was drunk, but not too drunk to notice. \n\nThe user's intent was to tip appropriately but was annoyed by the bartender's action. The bartender's response of refusing service might be against the law, depending on the location, as refusing service based on tipping could be a problem. But the user's refusal to tip after the bartender's mistake could be seen as a tit-for-tat. \n\nIn terms of who's at fault: The bartender shouldn't have added the tip without permission. The user's reaction might be too harsh, but maybe they're justified because they were tricked into paying a tip they didn't agree to. So maybe the user isn't entirely at fault. However, not tipping in a service industry is generally frowned upon unless there's a valid reason. Here, the user had a valid reason (unauthorized tip added), so maybe they're not in the wrong. \n\nSo the answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because the bartender's action was inappropriate, and the user had a reason to refuse the forced tip. But some might argue that the user should still tip regardless. But the situation is unique because the tip wasn't agreed upon. So probably B.\n"
