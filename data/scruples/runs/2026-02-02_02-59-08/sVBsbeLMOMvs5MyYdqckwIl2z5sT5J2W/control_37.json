      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the person went to a club with friends, bought 4 drinks for them, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without asking. The author got mad, left 0%, told the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people, and the bartender refused to serve them. The author is asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the etiquette around tipping. In the US, tipping is customary in service industries like bars and restaurants, usually around 15-20%. But the key here is that the bartender added the 20% without consulting the customer. Normally, when you pay, the server might expect you to add a tip, but if the bartender unilaterally added it and then the customer refused, that's a conflict.\n\nThe author was drunk, which might affect their judgment, but they still managed to notice the tip being added and decided to leave none. However, even if they were drunk, the standard practice is to tip, and not tipping could be seen as rude or unfair to the bartender. The author's reasoning is that the bartender shouldn't take advantage, but maybe the bartender was following standard practice, expecting a tip, and the customer's refusal is what's problematic.\n\nBut the author did offer to tip an appropriate amount themselves. So maybe the issue is the bartender adding the tip without permission. In some places, automatic gratuities are added for large groups or events, but for a regular customer, that might not be standard. The bartender's action of adding 20% without asking could be seen as overstepping, especially if the customer isn't expecting it. \n\nHowever, the author's response of leaving 0% is extreme. Even if the bartender added the tip by default, the appropriate response might be to adjust the tip amount rather than leave nothing. The author's argument is that the bartender shouldn't have done that, but the reaction of not tipping at all is what led to the conflict. \n\nThe bartender then refused service, which is within their rights in some places, but maybe the author is in the wrong because they didn't tip at all. But the initial action of the bartender might have been the root issue. \n\nSo, if the bartender shouldn't have added the tip without asking, then the author isn't entirely at fault. However, the author's refusal to tip at all is a strong response. In many cultures, especially in the US, not tipping is considered very rude regardless of the circumstances. So maybe the author is in the wrong because they didn't tip, even if the bartender's action was questionable. \n\nBut there's a nuance here. If the bartender added the tip without permission, the author could have adjusted it to a lower amount instead of leaving 0%. However, the author's argument is that the bartender was taking advantage, which might not be the case if the tip is expected as part of service. \n\nSo, the answer might depend on the local norms. In the US, tipping is a significant part of service workers' income, so not tipping is generally wrong. However, the bartender's action of adding the tip without asking might have been the initial mistake. The author's response was also wrong, but maybe they're both at fault. \n\nBut the question is if the author is in the wrong. If the author didn't tip and the bartender added a tip without permission, the author might not be entirely at fault. However, in most cases, even if the tip is added, the customer can adjust it. The author's choice to leave 0% is problematic. So maybe the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because they didn't tip, even if the bartender made a mistake first.\n"
