      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person went to a club, invited four friends for drinks, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without asking. The author, who was drunk but not too drunk to notice, decided to tip 0% and told the bartender not to take advantage of people who are drunk. The bartender then refused to serve them. The author is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, standard tipping etiquette typically involves tipping around 15-20% for service. However, the key here is that the bartender added the tip without informing the customer. Usually, the customer should have the choice to tip or not, and if the establishment automatically adds a tip, it's often done with a clear notice. If the bartender did this without the customer's knowledge, that could be an issue. The customer might feel it's deceptive, especially if they were drunk and not fully aware.\n\nBut then, the customer's response was to tip 0% and confront the bartender. That's where things get tricky. Even if the bartender made a mistake, the customer's reaction might be seen as inconsiderate. Bartenders rely heavily on tips, and refusing to tip could be seen as unfair, regardless of the situation. However, the bartender shouldn't have added the tip without permission. \n\nThe author's justification is that the bartender took advantage of their inebriated state. But if the customer was able to notice the tip being added and then decided to tip 0%, they might have been aware enough to make a choice. On the other hand, the bartender's threat to not serve them is also problematic because it's against their policy to refuse service just because a customer isn't tipping. \n\nSo, who is at fault? The author's actions might be seen as inappropriate because they refused to tip despite the service provided. However, the bartender's unauthorized tip addition is also an issue. But in terms of who is \"in the wrong\" more, the author's refusal to tip and confrontation could be considered more in the wrong because they didn't account for the bartender's need for tips and the social norm of tipping. Alternatively, if the bartender acted unethically by adding the tip without consent, the author might not be at fault. \n\nBut in most cases, expecting a tip is part of the service industry, and even if the bartender made a mistake, the customer's response was to not tip at all, which is a strong reaction. The author might be seen as in the wrong because they didn't handle it politely, maybe by discussing the error and then choosing to tip appropriately. So, leaning towards A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
