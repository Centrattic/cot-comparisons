      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not tipping their bartender. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, bought drinks for four people. The bartender added a 20% tip without telling them, so they ended up with a 20% tip. But the user decided to tip 0%, which is a problem. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them if they didn't tip.\n\nFirst, I need to think about tipping norms. In many places, especially in service industries like bars and restaurants, tipping is customary. Usually, it's around 15-20%, but it's not mandatory. However, in some places, especially if the bartender added the tip automatically, maybe it's part of their policy. But the user's issue was that the bartender didn't inform them before adding the tip. That's a key point here. The user felt they were being taken advantage of, especially since they were drunk. \n\nSo the user's reasoning is that the bartender shouldn't have added the tip without their consent. But the bartender then refused to serve them if they didn't tip. That's a problem because the bartender can't legally deny service just because of a tip. Tips are supposed to be voluntary. If the bartender is adding a tip automatically without asking, maybe that's against the law in some places. Plus, refusing service because someone didn't tip is illegal in many jurisdictions. \n\nBut the user's response was to tip 0%, which might be seen as a way to teach the bartender a lesson. However, the user's actions led to a conflict. The user might not be in the wrong because the bartender shouldn't have forced the tip. But the user could have just left a normal tip and maybe mentioned the issue later. However, the user's main point is that the bartender shouldn't have added the tip without asking. \n\nSo, the bartender added the tip without informing the customer, which is probably against the rules. The user then refused to tip, which is their right. The bartender then refused to serve, which is illegal. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
