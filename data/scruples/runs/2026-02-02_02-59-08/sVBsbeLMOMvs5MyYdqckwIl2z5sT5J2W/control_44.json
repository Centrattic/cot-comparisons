      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender when the bartender added a 20% tip without informing them. The situation is that the author was at a club with friends, invited four people to drink, and when paying, the bartender added the tip. The author, who was drunk but not too drunk to notice, refused to tip and told the bartender not to take advantage. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them if they didn't tip.\n\nFirst, I need to consider standard tipping practices. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary for service staff, and 20% is considered generous. However, the key issue here is that the bartender added the tip without the customer's knowledge or consent. Typically, if a business adds a gratuity automatically, they should inform the customer. The customer then has the right to accept or adjust it as they see fit. \n\nThe author's reaction was to tip 0%, which the bartender found unacceptable. The author's reasoning was that the bartender shouldn't take advantage of someone who's drunk, implying that the bartender's action was deceptive. But the author's own response was to deny a tip, leading to a confrontation. \n\nIs the author at fault? Well, tipping is a social norm based on the service received. If the bartender provided good service, the expectation is that the customer would tip. However, the bartender's action of adding the tip without asking might have been the initial problem. The author's refusal could be seen as a reaction to that, but in many contexts, even if the tip is added automatically, the customer is still expected to leave a tip unless there's poor service. \n\nBut the author was drunk, which might affect judgment. However, they were still able to notice the tip being added, so the argument about being taken advantage of might not hold as strongly. The bartender's refusal to serve further could be within his rights if the establishment has a policy requiring a tip. However, the author's stance is that the bartender shouldn't have added the tip without consent.\n\nI think the main point is whether the author's refusal to tip was justified. If the service was good, the author is in the wrong for not tipping, regardless of the bartender's action. However, if the bartender added the tip without informing, the author might have a point in adjusting it. But in standard practice, even if the tip is added automatically, the customer is still expected to tip. So the author's decision to not tip in this case might be considered wrong, especially if the service was good. However, the bartender's action of adding the tip without consent could be a breach of standard practice, which might shift some blame to the bartender. \n\nBut the question is about the author's fault. If the service was good, the author is at fault for not tipping. However, if the bartender's action was inappropriate, the author's reaction could be justified. But the author didn't mention the service being bad, just that the bartender added the tip. So maybe the author is in the wrong because they didn't tip despite good service, regardless of the automatic addition. However, the bartender's action might have been the initial issue. \n\nIn many places, automatic gratuities are added for large parties or events, but the customer is informed. If the bartender added it without informing, that's an issue. However, the customer's responsibility is to tip for good service. So if the service was good, the author is in the wrong for not tipping, even if the bartender added it automatically. Therefore, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong). But if the bartender's action was wrong, maybe the author isn't. But the question is whether the author is at fault. Since the author chose not to tip despite the service, they are at fault. Therefore, answer A.\n"
