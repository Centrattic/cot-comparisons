      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who didn't tip their bartender is in the wrong. The situation is that the author went to a club with friends, invited four friends to four drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling the author. The author, who was drunk but not too drunk to notice, decided to tip 0% and told the bartender not to take advantage of people. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve the author anymore if they didn't tip. The author wanted to tip an appropriate amount themselves but was upset about the bartender adding the tip without their consent.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the standard practices regarding tipping. In many places, especially in the service industry like bars and restaurants, tipping is customary. The standard is usually around 15-20%, sometimes more. However, the key point here is that the bartender added the tip without informing the customer. Typically, when a customer is paying, the service charge is added at the customer's discretion. If the bartender unilaterally added a tip without asking, that might be against the norm. \n\nThe author was upset and decided to leave 0% in response. They were drunk but functional enough to notice and react. The bartender then refused service, which is a common policy in some places when customers don't tip. However, the author's reasoning is that they wanted to tip appropriately but were annoyed by the bartender's action. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, if the standard is that you should tip, then not tipping could be seen as wrong. However, the bartender's action of adding a tip without permission is also a factor. In some cases, restaurants add a service charge for large groups or certain events, but in a bar setting, it's less common. If the bartender didn't inform the customer, that's a breach of protocol. The author's response of not tipping could be a reaction to that. \n\nAdditionally, the bartender's refusal to serve might be within their rights, but the situation is complicated by the initial mistake. The author's intent was to tip an appropriate amount but was upset by the bartender's unauthorized action. So, the author might not be in the wrong because they were reacting to something they found unacceptable. However, not tipping at all is generally frowned upon, regardless of the reason. \n\nSo, balancing these factors, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the bartender's action was inappropriate, and the author had a valid reason to react, even if not tipping is not ideal. Alternatively, it could be A if the standard is that tipping is expected regardless. But considering the bartender's error, the author's response is more understandable. Hence, I think the answer is B.\n"
