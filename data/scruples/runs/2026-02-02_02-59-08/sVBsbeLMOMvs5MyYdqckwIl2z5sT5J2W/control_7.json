      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about not tipping the bartender because the bartender added a 20% tip without asking. The person went to a club with friends, invited them to four drinks each, and when paying, the bartender automatically added a tip. The author got upset and tipped 0%, leading to a confrontation where the bartender said he won't serve them anymore if they don't tip. The author argues that the bartender took advantage of their drunk state, hence the zero tip.\n\nFirst, I need to think about tipping norms. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary for service workers like bartenders. The standard is usually around 15-20%. However, the issue here is that the bartender added the tip without informing the customer. Normally, when you pay with a credit card, sometimes the machine allows the server to add a tip, but the customer usually has to confirm or decline. If the bartender did this without any communication, that could be problematic. The author was drunk but not too drunk to notice, so their judgment might have been impaired, but they were still coherent enough to act.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the bartender shouldn't take advantage of someone's impaired state to add a tip. That's a valid argument because if someone is under the influence, their ability to make informed decisions is compromised. However, the author chose to respond with a 0% tip, which might be seen as retaliatory. Instead of just refusing to tip, maybe they could have asked the bartender to remove the 20% tip and then left an appropriate amount themselves. By leaving 0%, they might be punishing the bartender for the initial action, which could be unfair.\n\nBut then again, the bartender's action of adding the tip without consent is also an issue. If the establishment's policy allows servers to add tips without customer knowledge, that's a problem. The author's reaction could be a response to that policy. However, the way the author handled it\u2014retaliating with a 0% tip\u2014might not be the best approach. The bartender's refusal to serve them further complicates things. It's a power imbalance where the bartender can refuse service, but the customer has the right to refuse to pay a tip they didn't agree to.\n\nIn terms of legal rights, in some places, tips are supposed to be voluntary, and the server shouldn't add them without the customer's consent. So the bartender might be in the wrong for adding the tip without asking. However, in practice, tipping is often expected, and not tipping could be considered rude or unethical. The author's decision to not tip at all, even after being told to tip by the bartender, could be seen as inconsiderate, especially since they were already a customer who invited friends and had drinks.\n\nSo, breaking it down: the bartender's initial action was possibly against tipping etiquette if they added the tip without asking. The author's response, while understandable in wanting to correct an unfair action, might have been excessive by leaving 0%. The author could have communicated their discomfort and adjusted the tip themselves. Therefore, the author might share some responsibility for the conflict, but the bartender also had a part in initiating the issue.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? If the standard is that tipping is expected, and the author didn't tip at all, that's a problem. However, the specific reason for not tipping was the bartender's unauthorized addition, which complicates things. The author's action might be justified if they felt forced to tip without consent. However, the method of responding by not tipping at all might not be the best approach. So depending on cultural norms and expectations, the answer could vary. In some places, the author might be in the wrong for not tipping, but in others, the bartender's action is the issue. Given that the author was drunk, maybe their judgment was impaired, but they were still coherent enough to act. So perhaps the author is partially at fault for not handling it differently, but the bartender also shouldn't have added the tip without permission. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer might lean towards A (yes) because refusing to tip entirely could be seen as inconsiderate, even if the initial action was wrong. Alternatively, if the bartender's action was the main issue, the answer could be B. Hmm. Need to decide based on common standards. In many places, the expectation is that you tip, so even if the bartender added it without asking, the customer might still be expected to tip. Therefore, the author's refusal to tip is problematic, making them AITA. So answer A.\n"
