      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation (AITA) is in the wrong. The scenario is about not tipping the bartender because the bartender added a 20% tip without informing them.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The person went to a club with friends, bought drinks for four people, paid, and noticed the bartender added a tip without asking. They got upset, set the tip to 0%, and the bartender refused to serve them. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nIn many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary for services like bartending. However, the standard is usually for the customer to leave the tip voluntarily. If the bartender added a tip without the customer's knowledge, that could be an issue. The customer might feel they have control over how much to tip, especially if they're not inebriated to the point of being unable to make a decision. \n\nBut wait, the person was \"pretty drunk.\" If they were under the influence, could their judgment have been impaired? However, they mention they weren't too drunk to not notice the tip being added. So they were aware of the action. \n\nThe bartender's action of adding 20% without permission might be seen as overstepping. Normally, the customer decides the tip amount. If the bartender assumed a tip without asking, maybe that's not the customer's fault. However, the customer's response was to leave 0%, which could be seen as retaliatory. The bartender then refused service if they didn't tip. \n\nIs there a rule about tipping? In some places, it's expected, and not tipping could be considered rude. However, the bartender shouldn't have forced the customer to tip. The customer had the right to decide, but the bartender's refusal to serve might be a problem. \n\nBut the core question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the bartender didn't inform the customer, then the customer's refusal to tip could be justified. However, the standard expectation is to tip, so maybe the customer is in the wrong for not tipping at all. On the other hand, the bartender shouldn't have imposed the tip without permission. \n\nThis is a bit of a dilemma. The key points are: the customer didn't tip because the bartender added a tip without asking. The bartender then refused service. Legally, in some places, the bartender can't force the customer to tip, but the customer's act of not tipping might be socially frowned upon. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether the bartender had the right to add the tip. If the customer didn't agree to it, then the customer's response might be justified. However, the customer didn't tip at all, which is extreme. Maybe a middle ground would be better, but the situation is polarized. \n\nIn the end, the bartender shouldn't have added the tip without consent, and the customer had the right to not tip. However, the customer's response of 0% might be seen as wrong because typically you tip even if you're upset. But the bartender's actions were also inappropriate. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the bartender acted improperly first, and the customer had the right to refuse.\n"
