      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person went out with friends, invited four of them to drinks. So maybe they were splitting the bill? Then when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing the customer. The customer was drunk but still noticed this and decided not to tip, telling the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then refused to serve them unless they tipped. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, tipping customs vary by country, but in many places, especially in the US, a tip is expected as part of the service. Bartenders often rely on tips as part of their income. If the bartender added a tip without asking, maybe that's part of the establishment's policy. Some places automatically add a gratuity for groups or for certain services. However, the key here is that the bartender didn't inform the customer. Automatically adding a tip without consent could be an issue, especially if the customer isn't aware. \n\nThe customer was drunk but not too drunk to notice the bartender adding the tip. That suggests they had the capacity to object. If the bar's policy is to add a tip, they should communicate that clearly. The customer's response was to leave 0%, which could be seen as retaliatory. But the bartender threatened not to serve them if they didn't tip. That's a problem because the bartender shouldn't have the authority to refuse service over a tip. \n\nSo, the bartender might be at fault for adding the tip without informing, but the customer also didn't handle it well. Instead of confronting the bartender, maybe they should have addressed the issue after the fact. However, the customer's right to choose not to tip is debatable. If the service was poor, they might not tip, but in this case, the customer was upset about the automatic addition. The bartender's refusal to serve is overstepping, but the customer's zero tip might be a reaction to an unfair policy. \n\nThe core issue is whether the bartender's action was acceptable and whether the customer was justified in not tipping. If the bar's policy is to add a tip, it's their responsibility to inform customers. The customer's response was perhaps impulsive due to being drunk, but they did notice the unauthorized addition. The bartender shouldn't have made a threat. So maybe both parties have some responsibility. But the question is if the author is in the wrong. Since the bartender added the tip without permission and then made a threat, the customer's action might be a reaction to that. However, refusing to tip in response could be seen as a mistake because the customer could have addressed it another way. But the bartender's behavior was inappropriate. \n\nIn the end, the customer might not be entirely in the wrong because the bartender's actions were problematic. But the customer could have handled it better. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. Since the bartender added the tip without consent, the customer's refusal to tip might be justified as a form of protest against the bartender's action. But in typical tipping culture, not tipping is usually considered wrong regardless. So there's a conflict here. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (Not in the wrong) because the bartender's actions were questionable, and the customer had a right to be upset. However, the customer's response might not be the best approach. But since the question is about being in the wrong, and the bartender's unauthorized tip addition is a factor, the customer isn't entirely at fault.\n"
