      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who didn't tip their bartender is in the wrong. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, invited four friends for four drinks, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing them. The person was drunk but not too drunk to notice, and they responded by not tipping at all, telling the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then refused to serve them unless they tipped. The user is unsure if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the standard tipping norms. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is expected for services, and bartenders often rely on tips as a significant part of their income. The standard is usually around 15-20%. The person's friends were included in the invitation, so maybe they expected to cover all the costs, including tips. But the bartender added the tip without asking, which could be seen as an assumption. However, the customer has the right to adjust the tip if they feel it's incorrect. \n\nThen there's the issue of the customer being drunk. The person mentions they were pretty drunk but not too much to notice the tip. Being drunk can affect judgment, but it's not an excuse for poor behavior. The customer's response was to tip 0%, which is unusual and possibly confrontational. The bartender's response was to refuse service, which is a strong reaction but might be justified if the customer is being disruptive.\n\nThe key here is the interaction between the customer and the bartender. The customer felt the bartender was taking advantage by adding the tip without asking, which is a valid point because the customer should have control over how much they tip. However, reacting by not tipping at all and being confrontational could be seen as the customer's fault. The bartender's refusal to serve might be within their rights if they feel threatened or disrespected.\n\nBut in terms of responsibility, the customer might be at fault for not tipping, especially if the expectation was that tipping is part of the transaction. However, the bartender's action of adding the tip without permission could also be problematic. The customer's response, while perhaps harsh, might be a reaction to an inappropriate action by the bartender. \n\nConsidering all this, the customer might be at fault for not tipping, but there's a nuance here. The bartender's initial action could have contributed to the conflict. However, the customer's decision to tip 0% and the confrontation could be seen as the primary issue. So, the answer might lean towards the customer being in the wrong (A), but there's a counterargument. However, standard tipping etiquette usually expects a tip, so the customer's refusal could be the main issue.\n"
