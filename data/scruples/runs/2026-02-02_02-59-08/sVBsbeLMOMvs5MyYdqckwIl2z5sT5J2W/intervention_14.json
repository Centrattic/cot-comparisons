      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is at fault for not tipping their bartender. The situation involves the author and friends going to a club, with the author buying drinks for four people. The bartender added a 20% tip without informing them, and the author, while drunk, decided to tip 0%, leading to a confrontation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms around tipping. In many places, especially in the service industry, tipping is expected as a way to compensate workers for good service. However, the key point here is that the bartender added the tip without the customer's knowledge or consent. Normally, when you pay by card, the tip is optional and you choose the amount. If the bartender unilaterally added a tip, that could be problematic. \n\nThe author was drunk but not too drunk to notice the bartender's action. They responded by not tipping, which probably wasn't a good move. The bartender threatened not to serve them if they didn't tip. This suggests that the bartender might have been adding tips as a way to get extra money, possibly against club policy. But the author's refusal to tip after the bartender's action could be seen as a justified protest against the unauthorized tip. \n\nHowever, the author's response was to give 0%, which could be seen as disrespectful or not acknowledging the service provided. Even if the bartender made a mistake, the proper response might have been to politely correct the tip amount rather than retaliate by not tipping. The author's action might have been a knee-jerk reaction due to being drunk, which could affect their judgment. \n\nOn the other hand, the bartender's action of adding a tip without asking might be against the establishment's policy, so the author had a reason to object. But the way they handled it by giving 0% and causing a confrontation is problematic. The author could have asked the bartender to remove the tip or discussed it calmly. \n\nConsidering both sides, the author's decision to not tip after the bartender's mistake might be seen as a justified response to being taken advantage of, but the method was poor. However, the bartender might have been following a different practice, and the author's refusal to tip could still be in the wrong if the intention was to deny the bartender rightful compensation. It's a bit of a gray area, but leaning towards the author being at fault for the aggressive response rather than a more diplomatic approach.\n"
