      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) post is in the wrong for not tipping their bartender. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person went to a club with friends, bought them four drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without asking. The person got angry, tipped 0%, told the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people, and the bartender refused to serve them. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know my take.\n\nHmm. Let's start by considering standard tipping practices. In many places, especially in service industries like bars and restaurants, tipping is customary. It's often expected as part of the service worker's income. The author was paying for multiple friends' drinks, so the total might have been significant. The bartender added a 20% tip automatically. The author, feeling that the bartender was taking advantage because they were drunk, decided not to tip at all. But then the bartender refused service if they didn't tip.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, maybe they felt the bartender was being manipulative by adding the tip without permission, especially when they were intoxicated. They might have thought that the bartender was taking advantage of their state. However, the bartender's role is to provide service and receive tips as part of their compensation. If the customer is drunk, the bartender is expected to handle it responsibly, perhaps by not serving if they think the customer is too intoxicated, but that's a different scenario. Here, the bartender added the tip, which is a common practice, but didn't inform the customer. The author then punished the bartender by not tipping, leading to a confrontation.\n\nOn the other hand, the bartender might have thought that adding a tip was standard, but if they didn't communicate it, that's a problem. However, in many places, especially in the US, it's standard to leave a tip, and sometimes businesses add it automatically. The author's response of zero tipping and the comment about taking advantage might be seen as rude and not holding up their part of the social contract. The bartender's refusal to serve if they don't tip is also a bit questionable because, while they rely on tips, they can't force a customer to tip. However, in practice, some places do require a minimum tip, though that's controversial.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) The bartender added a tip without informing the customer. 2) The customer was drunk but not too drunk to act. 3) The customer refused to tip, leading to a conflict. 4) The bartender refused to serve.\n\nSo, the author's actions: Not tipping after being asked to pay, and making a confrontational comment. The bartender's actions: Adding a tip without asking, then refusing service. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the standard expectation is that customers should tip unless they have a valid reason. The author might have a point about the bartender not informing them, but the response of zero tipping and the accusation of taking advantage is harsh. The bartender, by adding the tip without asking, might have overstepped, but the customer's response was also problematic. \n\nIn many cases, if someone is drunk, the bartender's responsibility is to not serve if they think the person is too impaired, but here the customer wasn't refused service for being drunk, just for not tipping. The author's argument that the bartender was taking advantage because they were drunk might not hold because the customer was capable of paying. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author is likely in the wrong because they failed to tip despite the standard expectations, and their response was confrontational. The bartender's automatic tip might have been a mistake in communication, but the author's refusal to tip is the bigger issue. Therefore, the answer would be A (author is in the wrong).\n"
