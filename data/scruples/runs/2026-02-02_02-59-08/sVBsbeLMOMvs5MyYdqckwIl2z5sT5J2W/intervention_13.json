      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who didn't tip their bartender is at fault. The situation is that the person went to a club with friends, paid for drinks, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without asking. The person got drunk but not too drunk to notice, so they responded by tipping 0% and told the bartender not to take advantage of people who are drunk. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them if they didn't tip. The user is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider standard tipping practices. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary for service workers like bartenders. Typically, a 15-20% tip is expected. So if the bartender added 20% automatically, that's within the norm. However, the issue here is that the bartender didn't ask before adding the tip. Some places do automatic gratuities for large parties or for services like valet parking, but in this case, the person had a group of friends, but it's unclear if the bartender had a policy. The key point is that the bartender didn't inform the customer, which could be a problem. \n\nOn the other hand, the customer didn't tip anything, which is below the standard. Even if the bartender added a tip without asking, the customer's response was to give 0%, which might be seen as unreasonable. The bartender's response of not serving them if they don't tip could also be an issue because refusing service is a strong reaction, but in some cases, establishments can set their own policies regarding tipping.\n\nSo, is the customer at fault? They didn't tip, which is against the usual custom, but they were responding to the bartender adding a tip without consent. The bartender's action might have been against the policy of being transparent, but the customer's refusal to tip could be seen as not being cooperative. However, the customer's argument is that the bartender shouldn't take advantage of someone who's drunk. The customer was drunk but not too drunk to notice the tip being added, so maybe they were still aware enough to make a decision. \n\nIn terms of who is in the wrong, the customer might be at fault for not tipping at all, even if the bartender added a tip without asking. The appropriate response might have been to discuss the tip amount first or to adjust it rather than removing it entirely. On the other hand, if the bartender didn't have a policy of adding tips automatically, that could be a breach of etiquette. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the customer's action of not tipping is against the norm, but the bartender's action of adding a tip without permission might also be problematic. However, since the customer didn't tip anything, which is more severe, they might be in the wrong. But maybe the bartender shouldn't have done that. Hmm. The user said they think the author is in the wrong. The answer is A for yes.\n"
