I was willing to tip an appropriate amount myself, but him just putting in a 20% tip without telling me rubbed me the wrong way. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. The situation is that they invited four friends to drinks and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The author, who was drunk but not too drunk to notice, decided to tip 0% and told the bartender not to take advantage of people who are drunk. The bartender then refused to serve them if they didn't tip.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around tipping. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is expected in service industries like bars and restaurants. Bartenders often rely on tips for a significant portion of their income. But the key here is that the bartender added the tip himself without informing the customer. Normally, when you pay with a card, the server might ask if you want to add a tip, but the customer usually decides the amount.\n\nThe author was drunk but not incapacitated. They noticed the bartender adding the tip and chose not to tip, which could be seen as a justified reaction because they felt the bartender was taking advantage. The bartender's response was to refuse service, which is a bit of an overreaction. Legally, a bartender can't force someone to tip, but refusing service can be done for various reasons, though it might be problematic if it's based on discrimination or unfair practices.\n\nEthically, the author might feel wronged because they didn't agree to the tip. However, the standard expectation is that tips are a customer's choice. If the bartender added it without asking, that's against the usual practice. The author's response was to tip nothing, which is within their rights. The bartender's response to refuse service could be seen as unprofessional or even illegal, depending on local laws.\n\nSo, the author's action was a reaction to the bartender's possibly unethical behavior. The bartender shouldn't have added a tip without consent. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
