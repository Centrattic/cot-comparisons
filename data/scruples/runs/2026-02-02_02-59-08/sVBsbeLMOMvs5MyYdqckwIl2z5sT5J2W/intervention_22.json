      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. The situation is that the author was at a club, invited four friends to four drinks. The bartender added a 20% tip without informing them, and the author, who was drunk but not too drunk, decided to tip 0% in response. The bartender then refused to serve them if they didn't tip. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider standard tipping practices. In the US, tipping is customary for service workers, and not tipping can be seen as rude. However, the key point here is that the bartender added the tip without asking. Typically, when a bill is presented, the tip is either added by the customer or the server may add it if the establishment doesn't do it automatically. But the bartender here took the initiative to add 20% without the customer's knowledge. That could be problematic because the customer might not agree with the amount or the action of adding it without consent.\n\nThe author's response was to tip 0%, which is a direct counteraction. The author felt the bartender was taking advantage of their possible inebriation. The bartender's response of refusing service if they didn't tip again is also an issue. In many places, refusing service due to not tipping is against the law because tipping is voluntary. However, in some states, especially in places where tipped employees are paid a lower minimum wage, there might be a different expectation.\n\nSo, the author's actions were a reaction to the bartender's unilateral decision to add a tip. The author's mistake could be in not discussing the issue with the bartender first, perhaps asking to remove the tip and then deciding on an appropriate amount. Instead, the author took a confrontational stance by tipping 0%, which is seen as disrespectful. However, the bartender's initial action of adding the tip without consent is also wrong. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key factors are the bartender's unauthorized tip addition and the author's response. If the author had the right to decide how much to tip, then the bartender overstepped. However, by tipping 0%, the author might be violating social norms of tipping, regardless of the situation. The bartender's refusal to serve might be a separate legal issue, but the author's choice to tip 0% in response to the unauthorized tip could be seen as justified. However, the appropriate action would be to either remove the tip and add an appropriate amount or discuss it with the bartender first. The author's choice to tip 0% without communication could be seen as inconsiderate, even if the bartender's action was wrong. Therefore, the author might be partly at fault for not handling it more diplomatically.\n"
