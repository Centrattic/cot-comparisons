      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. The story is that the author and friends went to a club, the author invited four friends to drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without asking. The author, who was drunk but not too drunk to notice, refused to tip and said the bartender shouldn't take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then threatened to not serve him anymore if he didn't tip. The author claims he wanted to tip an appropriate amount himself but the bartender adding the tip without permission was a problem.\n\nHmm, so first, tipping practices can vary a lot depending on the country or region. In some places, like the US, tipping is customary and expected, especially in service industries. Bartenders often rely on tips as a significant part of their income. The author is inviting friends, so maybe he's responsible for the bill, including tips. \n\nThe bartender added a 20% tip without informing the customer. That's a bit unusual. Normally, tips are either added by the customer or the server might add them with a note, but expecting a customer to pay a tip they didn't agree to could be an issue. However, in some contexts, servers might add a gratuity for large groups, but this was four people, which isn't a huge group. \n\nThe author was drunk but not overly so. He noticed the bartender adding the tip and decided to tip 0%. That's a strong reaction. The bartender then threatened not to serve him. The author's reasoning was that the bartender was taking advantage of someone who was drunk. But is it the bartender's responsibility to enforce tipping when the customer is intoxicated? Or is the customer responsible for ensuring they tip appropriately, regardless of the server's actions?\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, refusing to tip at all could be seen as rude or unfair to the bartender who depends on tips. On the other hand, the bartender added the tip without consent, which might be considered deceptive or unethical. The author's response of 0% seems excessive, but maybe the real issue is the bartender's action of adding the tip without permission. \n\nBut in many places, even if a server adds a tip, the customer is expected to pay it. If the author didn't want to tip, he should have been clear at the time of payment, maybe by adjusting the tip after the server added it. However, the author's response of 0% might have been a way to protest the server's action. \n\nThe bartender's threat to not serve him anymore is a bit strong too. If the author had wanted to tip a different amount, maybe a better approach would have been to explain that and negotiate, rather than zero. But the author might feel wronged by the automatic tip. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author's actions are problematic because he refused to tip entirely, which could be seen as withholding a customary gratuity. However, the bartender's action of adding the tip without consent is also questionable. But in terms of who is in the wrong, the author might be in the wrong because tipping is expected, and even if the bartender added it without permission, the author could have adjusted the tip amount instead of cutting it to zero. The author's response was more severe than necessary, especially since he was willing to tip an appropriate amount, but his action of 0% is what led to the conflict. Therefore, the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
