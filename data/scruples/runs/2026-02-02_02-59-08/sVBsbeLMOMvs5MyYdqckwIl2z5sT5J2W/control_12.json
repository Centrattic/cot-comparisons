      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, invited four friends for drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing the person. The person was drunk but not too much to notice, and they ended up tipping 0%, saying the bartender shouldn't take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then refused to serve them unless they tipped. The person is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around tipping in bars. Typically, tipping bartenders is customary in many places, especially in the US, where they often rely on tips as part of their income. However, the key here is that the bartender added the tip without the customer's knowledge. That could be a point of contention. If the bartender didn't inform the customer that they were adding a tip, that's a problem because it's not the customer's choice. Normally, people tip voluntarily, so if the bartender is unilaterally adding it, that's against standard practices.\n\nThe customer's response was to tip 0%, which might be seen as a protest. The reason given is that the bartender shouldn't take advantage of someone who's drunk. The person was drunk but not too drunk to notice the tip being added. The bartender then threatened not to serve them if they didn't tip. This could be a power imbalance, as the bartender is enforcing a tip on the spot, which isn't typical. In some places, it's illegal to force a tip, but in others, it might be allowed if it's automatically added. However, even if it's allowed, not informing the customer could be an issue.\n\nAnother angle: the person invited four friends for drinks. Maybe the total bill was split, and the person was responsible for their own portion. The bartender adding a tip without consent could have affected the person's portion. The person's reaction was to refuse to tip, which led to the bartender refusing service. That's a possible conflict of interest\u2014using refusal of service to enforce tipping when the tip was added without permission.\n\nSo, considering the bartender's actions first: adding a tip without informing the customer is against the principle of voluntary tipping. The customer's right to choose how much to tip is being bypassed. Therefore, the customer's response of tipping 0% as a reaction to the bartender's unauthorized addition could be justified. However, refusing to tip at all, even if the tip was forced, might still be problematic because in many places, the service charge is part of the payment for the staff. If the customer is in a place where mandatory tipping is required by law, then not tipping could be against the rules. But if the bartender added it without permission, then it's the bartender who's in the wrong.\n\nAlso, the bartender's threat to not serve the customer if they don't tip is aggressive. It's possible that the bartender is trying to enforce a policy that's not in line with local laws. In some jurisdictions, businesses can charge a service fee, but that's different from a tip. Tips are supposed to be given by customers voluntarily. If the bartender is adding a tip without the customer's consent, that could be a violation. The customer is then in a difficult position where they have to choose between paying an unwanted tip or facing a refusal of service.\n\nIn conclusion, the person's action of not tipping is a response to the bartender's unauthorized addition. The bartender's actions are questionable, and the customer's refusal could be seen as self-defense. The person might not be in the wrong because the bartender initiated the issue by adding the tip without permission. However, the customer could have handled it differently, like discussing the issue calmly or paying the tip they intended. But given the bartender's actions, the customer's response is understandable. So the answer is B, not in the wrong.\n"
