      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who didn't tip the bartender is in the wrong. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, bought them drinks, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing them. The person got drunk but still noticed and decided to leave 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage. The bartender then refused to serve them unless they tipped. The user wants to know if they're at fault here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around tipping. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary for services like bartending. However, usually, the customer decides the tip amount based on their satisfaction. The bartender added a 20% tip without asking, which the customer found deceptive. That's a key point. The customer was drunk but still aware of the added tip, so their decision to not tip might be a reaction to the bartender's action.\n\nBut there's a conflict here: the bartender added a tip without consent. In most cases, servers aren't supposed to add tips without the customer's knowledge unless the establishment is doing it automatically, which is a policy decision. However, if the bartender did this individually, that might be against the restaurant's policy and unethical. The customer's response was to leave 0%, which could be seen as a protest against the unauthorized tip. However, refusing to tip at all might be considered rude or inconsiderate, especially if they were a regular or expected to tip.\n\nAlso, the bartender threatening not to serve them if they didn't tip is problematic. Employees shouldn't have the authority to deny service based on tip amounts; that's the management's role. So the bartender overstepped by refusing service. \n\nThe customer's reasoning is that the bartender shouldn't take advantage of someone who's drunk. While the customer was drunk, they were still conscious enough to make a decision. However, drunk people are often less able to make informed choices, so the bartender's action might have been taking advantage of that. \n\nOn the other hand, the customer did choose to not tip, which could be seen as not honoring the standard practice, even if there was a misunderstanding. But the main issue here is the bartender's unauthorized tip. If the establishment does have an automatic tip policy, the customer should have been informed beforehand. If not, the bartender acted unethically.\n\nSo, the customer's refusal to tip in response to the bartender's action might be justified as a reaction to the bartender's dishonesty. The bartender shouldn't have added a tip without consent. Therefore, the customer isn't necessarily in the wrong. The bartender's behavior is more questionable here. The key is whether the bartender had the right to add the tip without informing the customer. If the establishment's policy allows automatic tips, then the customer might be expected to tip, but if the bartender did it on his own, that's a different matter.\n\nIn conclusion, the customer's action was a response to the bartender's unauthorized tip. The bartender overstepped by adding the tip and then denying service. The customer isn't entirely at fault here because the initial action by the bartender was inappropriate. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
