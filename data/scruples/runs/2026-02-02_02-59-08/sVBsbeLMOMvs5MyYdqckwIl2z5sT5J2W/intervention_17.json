      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, invited four friends to drinks, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The author was drunk but noticed this and decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them anymore if they didn't tip. The user thinks the author is at fault but wants confirmation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of tipping culture. In many places, especially in service industries like bars, tipping is customary and often expected. Bartenders rely on tips as a significant part of their income. However, the key point here is that the bartender added the tip without informing the customer. Normally, the customer is in control of the tip amount, though some places may have default tips. If the bartender unilaterally added 20%, that might be against the club's policy or the standard practice. \n\nThe author was drunk but not too drunk to notice. So, they made a conscious decision to remove the tip. The bartender then threatened not to serve them. The question is whether the author's action of zeroing out the tip was wrong. \n\nFrom one angle, the author is right to object to the bartender adding a tip without permission. Tipping should be the customer's choice, and the bartender's action could be seen as taking advantage, as the author claims. On the other hand, refusing to tip at all after the bartender's response might be seen as a tit-for-tat reaction, and the bartender's refusal to serve could be a justified response to the customer's refusal to tip, especially if it's a policy. \n\nBut in the U.S., for example, tipping is largely a customer's choice, though there's social pressure to tip. If the bartender added the tip without consent, maybe the author is justified in removing it. However, the author's response of zeroing it out instead of negotiating or leaving a smaller tip might be seen as harsh. The bartender's response of refusing service could be a policy decision to enforce tipping. \n\nSo, the author's mistake might be in not tipping at all, given that the bartender was trying to add it, but the bartender's action of adding without consent is also problematic. The key here is whether the author's zero tip was a reasonable response. If the author felt the bartender was acting inappropriately by adding the tip, maybe they should have left a smaller amount or discussed it. Instead, removing the tip entirely might be seen as cutting off the bartender's income without a valid reason. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might be at fault for not tipping after the bartender was trying to add it, unless the bartender's action was against policy. If the bartender had a policy of adding tips, the author might have a point, but if not, then the author's zero tip could be wrong. Since the scenario doesn't mention club policy, it's a bit ambiguous, but generally, refusing to tip at all is considered inconsiderate, especially after a direct confrontation.\n"
