      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. The situation is that the author went to a club with friends, bought drinks for four people, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without asking. The author was drunk but noticed this and decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then threatened to not serve them anymore. The author is wondering if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to think about tipping norms. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary for service workers like bartenders. The usual range is 15-20%, so the bartender adding 20% might be in line with that. However, the key issue here is that the bartender added the tip without informing the customer. The author felt that was taking advantage of their drunken state, so they refused to tip. \n\nNow, is the author wrong? Well, the bartender's action of adding a tip without consent might be the problem here. Normally, the customer should have control over the tip amount, especially since it's part of their payment. If the bartender unilaterally added a tip, that could be seen as overstepping. The author's response of refusing to tip might be a reaction to this unauthorized addition. \n\nBut then, the author didn't give any tip. Even if the bartender added 20%, the author could have still tipped a small amount to be polite. However, they were upset because the bartender didn't ask. The bartender then threatened to not serve them again if they didn't tip. That's a bit of a power play. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the author might have a point in that the bartender shouldn't assume the tip. But by not tipping at all, the author is withholding compensation that's typically expected. However, the bartender's action of adding the tip without permission might have been the initial wrong. \n\nSo, considering both sides, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but they could have handled it better. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nThe bartender's actions might have triggered the author's response. But in terms of standard tipping practices, even if the bartender added 20%, the author could still tip a little. But the author was drunk and didn't want to be taken advantage of. The bartender's threat to not serve them again is also problematic. \n\nI think the key here is that the bartender added the tip without consent, which is an issue. The author's refusal to tip in response could be seen as a justified reaction to that. However, not tipping at all in a culture where tipping is expected is still problematic. But the initial action by the bartender might shift some responsibility. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the bartender acted first inappropriately by adding the tip without permission. The author's response, while maybe extreme, was a reaction to that. However, the author could have still tipped a small amount. But given the bartender's actions, the author's stance might be understandable. \n\nAlternatively, some might argue that the author should have just tipped the 20% since it's customary, but the unauthorized addition complicates things. I think the answer is B because the bartender's actions were inappropriate, and the author's response, while not perfect, was a reaction to that. But maybe not. Another angle: in some places, it's common for the tip to be added automatically, so the author's refusal could be seen as unreasonable. \n\nThis is tricky. If automatic tipping is standard where they are, the author's refusal is problematic. If it's not standard, then the bartender's action is the issue. The scenario doesn't specify location, but in the US, tipping is expected and sometimes added automatically in some places. So maybe the author is in the wrong because they refused to tip, even if the bartender added it. However, the bartender didn't ask, so the author might feel forced. \n\nI'm leaning towards B (No), because the bartender's action of adding the tip without permission was the initial problem, and the author's response was a reaction to that. But the author could have still tipped a little. However, considering the bartender's threat, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. It's a bit of a gray area, but the answer might be B.\n"
