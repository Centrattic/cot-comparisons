      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they went to a club with friends and bought everyone drinks. The bartender added a 20% tip without telling them, and the author was drunk but noticed. They then decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them if they didn't tip.\n\nFirst, I need to think about tipping norms. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is part of the service industry compensation. Bartenders often rely on tips as a significant portion of their income. So adding a 20% tip might be standard practice, but the key here is that the bartender did it without informing the customer. That could be an issue because the customer didn't get a chance to agree to it. However, sometimes places automatically add a gratuity for large groups or events, which is common in restaurants and bars.\n\nThe author was drunk but not too drunk to notice the tip being added. They felt the bartender was taking advantage, so they refused to tip. But the problem is that the bartender might have been following a policy of adding a tip for groups, which is standard. By not tipping, the author is essentially removing the tip that the bartender expected. The bartender's response of refusing service could be a policy to enforce tipping, but that might not be legal. In some places, customers can't be forced to tip, and refusing service for not tipping could be against the law.\n\nBut from the author's perspective, they felt the tip was added without their consent, so they wanted to correct that. However, the usual expectation is that if you receive service, you tip. The author's action of not tipping might be seen as wrong because they're denying the bartender a tip that was added in line with the establishment's policy. Even if the policy is to add a tip, the customer might still have the right to remove it, but the bartender's refusal to serve could be problematic.\n\nAnother angle: The author invited friends and covered their drinks, which is generous. But the act of not tipping after the fact, even if the tip was added without consent, could be seen as rude or disrespectful. Bartenders rely on tips, so refusing to tip might be considered inconsiderate, especially if the customer is aware of the norm. The author's reasoning might be valid in terms of the tip being added without asking, but the reaction of not tipping could be seen as not supporting the service provided.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The bartender's action of adding a tip without asking is questionable, but the author's response of not tipping and the subsequent conflict might make them at fault. Since tipping is expected, the author might be considered in the wrong for not tipping, especially since they had the option to adjust the tip after seeing it was added. But if the bartender added it without informing, maybe the author is justified. However, typically, customers can adjust or remove tips, but the bartender's refusal to serve is another issue. The answer might depend on local laws and norms. But in general, the author's action of not tipping after the fact might be seen as wrong, so answer A.\n"
