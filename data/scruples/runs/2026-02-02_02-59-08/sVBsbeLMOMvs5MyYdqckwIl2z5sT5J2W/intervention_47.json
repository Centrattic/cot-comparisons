      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. The situation involves a group of friends at a club where the author invited four friends to four drinks each. The bartender added a 20% tip without informing the author, who then tipped 0% and was told by the bartender that he wouldn't serve them anymore if they didn't tip.\n\nFirst, the author is in the club, which is a place where tipping is typically expected, though maybe not as standard as a restaurant. Bartenders often rely on tips as a significant part of their income, so not tipping could be seen as unfair. The author's reasoning is that the bartender tried to add the tip without permission, so they retaliated by not tipping at all. \n\nBut here's the thing: when you pay with a credit card, many places allow the server to add a gratuity, especially if the party is large. However, in this case, the author was paying for their own group, so the bartender adding 20% without asking might have been an overreach. However, the author's response of zero tip and refusal to tip could be seen as cutting off the bartender's income entirely. \n\nThe bartender's reaction was to refuse service, which is a bit extreme, but maybe he's standing up for his earnings. The author might not know the standard tipping practices in clubs. In some places, tipping bartenders is customary, even if the service is self-serve. If the author didn't want the 20%, maybe they should have adjusted it to 15% or 18% instead of zero. \n\nSo, the author's mistake was not knowing the local customs and responding in a way that completely denied the bartender any tip. The bartender adding the tip without permission was wrong, but the author's response was also wrong because they didn't offer any alternative. The right approach might have been to politely correct the tip amount rather than erase it entirely. Therefore, the author is at least partially in the wrong.\n"
