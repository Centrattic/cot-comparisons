      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who didn't tip the bartender is in the wrong. The situation is they went to a club with friends, invited four friends to four drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The person, who was drunk but not too drunk to notice, decided to tip 0% and told the bartender not to take advantage. The bartender then refused to serve them if they didn't tip. The person didn't want to tip automatically because it felt like the bartender was taking advantage of their state.\n\nFirst, I need to consider usual tipping practices. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary for service workers like bartenders. The standard is usually 15-20%, but it's supposed to be a voluntary tip based on the service received. However, some places might have a policy where a tip is automatically added unless the customer specifies otherwise. But the key here is that the bartender didn't tell the customer about the 20% being added. Automatically adding a tip without informing the customer could be an issue, especially if the customer is under the influence.\n\nThe person in the story was drunk but still coherent enough to notice the automatic tip. They felt the bartender was taking advantage. By refusing to tip, they stood their ground, but the bartender then refused to serve them. The question is whether the person is at fault for not tipping.\n\nOn one hand, the bartender might have violated the customer's right by adding a tip without consent. Tipping should be a choice. If the establishment has a policy of automatically adding a tip, they should inform customers. If they didn't, the customer might have a valid reason to be upset. Also, in some regions, automatic gratuities are allowed (like for large parties or bad service), but the key is transparency. If the bartender didn't mention it, maybe that's a problem.\n\nOn the other hand, the person could be at fault for not tipping when they were aware of the standard practice. Bartenders rely on tips as part of their income. Refusing to tip, even if the customer feels pressured, might be seen as rude or unfair, especially if the service was standard. However, the bartender's actions could be seen as coercive, which complicates it.\n\nAnother angle: if the bartender added the tip without permission, the customer has the right to adjust it. But if the customer chose not to tip at all, that might be harsh. Maybe the right approach would have been to correct the tip to a lower amount instead of zero. But the customer's reaction was to tell the bartender not to take advantage, which is their right. The bartender's response of refusing to serve is also problematic because it's his job to serve customers, and he can't just deny service unless there's a valid reason like disturbance.\n\nIn some places, establishments can't automatically add a tip unless it's for a bad service, and even then, they need to inform. If the bartender added it without explanation, that's against the norm. So the customer might have a point. However, the customer's response of not tipping at all might be extreme, but they were drunk and maybe not in the best state to handle the situation.\n\nSo, considering all this, the person might not be in the wrong because the bartender added the tip without consent. The customer had the right to remove it, even if they ended up not tipping. The bartender's refusal to serve is also an issue. Therefore, the answer might be B (No).\n"
