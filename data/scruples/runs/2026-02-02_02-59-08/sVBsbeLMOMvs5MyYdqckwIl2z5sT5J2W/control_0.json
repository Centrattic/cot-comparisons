      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, paid for 4 drinks for their friends, and the bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The author was drunk but not so much that they didn't notice. They told the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people by adding the tip, and the bartender threatened not to serve them unless they tipped. The author is now asking if they're the asshole.\n\nSo, first, I need to figure out the etiquette around tipping. Normally, in places like bars, especially in the US, tipping is expected. Bartenders rely on tips as part of their income. If the author went to a club, which is a high-end place, maybe tipping is even more expected. The author paid for 4 drinks for friends, so maybe they were spending a significant amount. The total bill might have been higher, but the key point is that the bartender added a 20% tip without asking. The author, being drunk but coherent, refused to tip because they felt the bartender was taking advantage. The bartender then refused service if they didn't tip.\n\nNow, is the author at fault? Well, tipping is customary in many service industries. Even if the bartender added the tip without permission, the author could have just paid the total and walked out. Instead, they refused to tip, which might be seen as a breach of etiquette. However, the bartender's action of adding the tip without asking could be considered dishonest or manipulative, especially if the author was drunk and might not have been able to notice. The author's response was to take away the tip as a form of protest, which could be seen as taking away the bartender's rightful earnings. The bartender then refused service, which might be a problem because they can't deny service based on that. But the author's refusal to tip might also be a problem because they didn't pay the expected tip.\n\nAnother angle: the author might have been within their rights to not tip if they felt the service was poor or if they were being overcharged. However, the situation here is that the bartender added the tip without consent. The author might have been trying to correct an error in the total charge. But in many places, if the total includes a tip, the customer is expected to pay it unless there's a mistake. So, maybe the author is in the wrong because even if the tip was added without asking, they should have just paid and left, rather than refusing to tip. Alternatively, if the bartender didn't inform the customer that the tip was being added, that's on the bartender. But the customer still has the responsibility to pay the agreed-upon amount, including tips, unless there's an issue with the service.\n\nAlso, the author was drunk. That might affect their judgment, but they still had the capacity to notice the tip being added. If they were in a club where tipping is standard, refusing to tip could be seen as rude. However, the bartender's action of adding the tip without asking could be considered unethical. So the author's response was to take away the tip as a protest, which is a bit of a conflict between the customer's right to be informed about the total and the service worker's reliance on tips.\n\nIn some places, adding a tip without the customer's knowledge is illegal. So if the bartender did that, the author might have a point. But the author's solution was to not tip at all, which could be seen as taking away the bartender's income. The bartender's threat to not serve them if they didn't tip is also a problem, but the author's initial refusal might be the root of the conflict.\n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole) forums, usually, if someone refuses to tip in a place where it's expected and without a valid reason, they might be considered the asshole. However, if the service worker is adding a tip without permission, that's on the worker. But the customer's responsibility is to pay the correct amount. If the tip was already added, the customer is supposed to pay it unless there's a mistake. So the author might be in the wrong for not paying the tip they were supposed to give, even if the bartender's action was questionable. Alternatively, if the tip was an automatic gratuity added without the customer's consent, that's a problem, but the author's refusal to pay it might not be the right approach.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because they refused to tip, which is against the norm, even if the bartender made a mistake. However, the bartender's action was also wrong. But in the AITA context, the person who starts the conflict by not following etiquette might be the one in the wrong. Therefore, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong).\n"
