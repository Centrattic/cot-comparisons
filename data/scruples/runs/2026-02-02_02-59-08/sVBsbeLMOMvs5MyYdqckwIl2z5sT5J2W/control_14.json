      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who didn't tip their bartender is in the wrong. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, invited four friends to four drinks, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The person was drunk but not too drunk to notice. They then tipped 0% and told the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender refused to serve them if they didn't tip. The person wants to know if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the standard etiquette around tipping. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary in service industries, and the standard is often 15-20%. However, the key issue here is that the bartender added the tip without asking or informing the customer. Normally, the customer is expected to decide how much to tip, unless the establishment has a policy to add a service charge automatically, which is usually communicated upfront.\n\nSo, the bartender's action of adding 20% without notification might be problematic. If the customer is supposed to tip, then the bartender shouldn't have taken it upon himself to add it. The customer's reaction of refusing to tip because the bartender tried to take advantage might be justified, especially since the bartender's action could be seen as deceptive.\n\nHowever, the customer was drunk. Even though they were drunk, they were still conscious enough to notice the tip being added and made a deliberate choice not to tip. The bartender's response of refusing to serve unless tipped might be within his rights if the venue has a no-tipping policy, but usually, the venue would handle that, not the bartender directly. So the bartender might have overstepped by refusing service personally.\n\nOn the other hand, the customer could have communicated their intent to tip appropriately but not have the bartender add it automatically. Alternatively, they could have corrected the tip amount after realizing. But the customer chose to tip 0%, which is against the usual etiquette, leading to the conflict.\n\nThe question is whether the customer is in the wrong. If the bartender added the tip without consent, that's an issue. But the customer's refusal to tip at all, even after the mistake was made, might be seen as unreasonable. However, the bartender's initial action was the root problem. So maybe the customer isn't entirely at fault. But they could have handled it differently, like asking to adjust the tip instead of refusing altogether. \n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole) standards, sometimes both sides can have some fault. But in this case, the bartender acted first by adding the tip without permission, which is a breach of customer autonomy. The customer's reaction, while possibly confrontational, was a response to that breach. So the bartender might be more at fault here. Therefore, the answer might be B, the customer is not in the wrong.\n"
