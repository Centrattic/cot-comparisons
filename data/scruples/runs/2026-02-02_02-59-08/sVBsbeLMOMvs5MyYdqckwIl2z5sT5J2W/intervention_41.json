      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about not tipping a bartender. The person went to a club with friends, invited four friends to four drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The author, when drunk but not too drunk, refused to tip, told the bartender not to take advantage, and the bartender threatened not to serve them anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around tipping. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is expected as part of the service industry's income. Bartenders rely on tips for a significant portion of their earnings. The author's friends were invited to drinks, so maybe the author is responsible for the bill, including the tip. But here, the bartender added a 20% tip without asking, which the author took issue with. The author then decided to leave 0%, arguing that the bartender shouldn't take advantage of someone who's drunk. \n\nThe key points are: Did the bartender have the right to add the tip without permission? Is it acceptable to not tip in response? The author might argue that the bartender shouldn't assume the tip amount, but the bartender might argue that it's standard practice and necessary for their income. The author's decision to not tip after the bartender's action could be seen as a breach of etiquette. However, the bartender's action of adding the tip without asking could be problematic. \n\nAnother angle: The author was drunk. In some cases, being under the influence can affect judgment, but the author claims they weren't too drunk to notice the added tip. The bartender's response to not serve them if they don't tip might be seen as aggressive, but they might be standing up for their own earnings. \n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole), the question is whether the author overreacted. If the author believed the bartender was being unethical by adding the tip without informing, but then not tipping in return, that could be seen as the author's mistake. Typically, even if a tip is added automatically, customers are expected to follow the norm unless they have a specific reason not to. The threat from the bartender might be harsh, but the author's refusal to tip could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nConsidering all this, the author might be in the wrong because they refused to tip after the bartender added it, even if the bartender's method was questionable. The appropriate action might have been to discuss the tip amount politely, not to retaliate by leaving nothing. So the answer leans towards AITA being the author's fault.\n"
