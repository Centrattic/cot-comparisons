      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who didn't tip their bartender is in the wrong. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, invited four friends to four drinks each. The bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The person was drunk but noticed this and decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then refused to serve them unless they tipped. The user wants to know if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider standard tipping practices. In many places, especially in the US, it's customary to tip service workers like bartenders around 15-20%. However, the key point here is that the bartender added the tip without the customer's knowledge. Normally, when you pay with a card, the server might add a tip, but it's usually optional and should be communicated. If the bartender did this without informing the customer, that could be an issue. The customer might feel that their autonomy is violated if someone else decides their tip amount for them.\n\nThe customer was drunk but not too drunk to notice the added tip. They responded by not tipping at all, which led to a confrontation. The bartender's response of refusing service if they don't tip appropriately is problematic. In many places, businesses can't force customers to tip, though some have policies that include a mandatory service charge. However, this seems like the bartender was adding it on his own, not following a restaurant policy. \n\nThe customer's argument is that they were willing to tip an appropriate amount but were upset the bartender assumed control. The bartender's action might have been an overstep, especially if there's no policy in place. The customer's decision to not tip in response could be seen as a protest against the bartender's unauthorized addition. However, not tipping at all might be considered inconsiderate regardless, even if the method was wrong.\n\nSo, the question is whether the customer is in the wrong. If the bartender had the right to add a tip without asking, then the customer is wrong for not tipping. But if the bartender shouldn't have added it unilaterally, then the customer's reaction is understandable. Also, the bartender threatening not to serve is possibly against the law if the business allows tipping to be optional. \n\nIn conclusion, there are two sides here. The customer's action of not tipping 0% is unkind, but the bartender's action of adding the tip without informing might be the root of the problem. Depending on local laws and standards, the customer might not be entirely in the wrong. However, the act of not tipping could still be seen as rude. But given the bartender's overstepping, maybe the customer isn't at fault. Hmm, maybe the answer is B.\n"
