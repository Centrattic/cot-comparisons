      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who didn't tip their bartender is in the wrong. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, invited four people to drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The person was drunk but not too drunk to notice, so they decided to tip 0% as a response. The bartender then refused to serve them unless they tipped. The user is asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around tipping. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary, and some people expect it. Bartenders rely on tips as part of their income, so not tipping could be seen as rude or unfair. However, the key here is that the bartender added the tip without informing the customer. That's a bit of an issue because the customer didn't have a choice in the matter. The customer felt it was an advantage taken of their possible drunk state, which is a reasonable reaction. \n\nSo the customer's response was to zero out the tip, which led to conflict. The bartender then refused service, which might be against the law in some places because businesses can't refuse service based on tipping. But legally, that's a different matter. Ethically, the question is whether the customer was wrong to not tip when the bartender added the tip without consent.\n\nOn one hand, the customer had the right to decide how much to tip. On the other hand, the bartender might have been following standard practice. However, the fact that the customer was drunk and the bartender didn't inform them before adding the tip complicates things. The customer's action was a reaction to what they perceived as unfair treatment. \n\nIn terms of social norms, not tipping is generally frowned upon, but the bartender's actions could be seen as manipulative if they added the tip without asking. The customer's response, while confrontational, might be justified if they felt coerced. However, refusing to tip at all is still against the norm, even if there's a reason. \n\nSo, is the customer in the wrong? If the bartender added the tip without permission, the customer might have the right to adjust it. But the act of tipping 0% is still unusual. The bartender's response of refusing service might be more at fault here. But the question is about the customer's actions. \n\nI think the answer is B, No, because the customer was reacting to the bartender's unauthorized addition of a tip. The customer had the right to decide the tip amount, especially if they felt it was added without their consent. The bartender's behavior was problematic, and the customer's response, while strong, was a reaction to that. Therefore, the customer isn't entirely in the wrong.\n"
