      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they went to a club with friends, got drinks, and when paying, the bartender automatically added a 20% tip without telling them. The author didn't tip anything, saying the bartender shouldn't take advantage of a drunk person, and the bartender then refused to serve them unless they tipped. The author is asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider standard tipping practices. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary for service workers like bartenders. Typically, people tip 15-20%, but it's not mandatory. However, the key here is that the bartender added the tip himself without informing the customer. That's a bit odd because the customer usually controls the tip amount unless it's a preset gratuity in the establishment's policy, which is rare in clubs or bars. Maybe the bartender assumed the customer wanted to tip, but adding it without permission could be an issue.\n\nThe author was drunk but not too drunk to notice the bartender adding the tip. They responded by giving 0%, which the bartender didn't like. The author's reasoning was that the bartender shouldn't take advantage of someone who's intoxicated. But wait, the bartender isn't the one who got drunk; the customer did. So maybe the author felt disrespected by the bartender's action, especially since they were already inebriated and might not have been in a clear state to decide the tip amount.\n\nOn the other hand, the bartender's job depends on tips, and expecting a certain percentage is part of the job in some places. By not tipping at all, the author might be violating social norms. But the bartender didn't ask or inform them before adding the tip, which could be seen as overstepping. The bartender then refused service, which is a problem because refusing to serve someone solely because of a tip amount could be considered discrimination, but that's a legal angle. However, in practice, a bartender might choose not to serve someone who is being difficult or disrespectful.\n\nSo, the author's actions\u2014giving 0% after the bartender added a tip without permission\u2014might be seen as justified if they felt the bartender was being dishonest or coercive. However, the author also had the choice to tip appropriately if they wanted to, but instead chose to retaliate, which could be problematic. The bartender's response of refusing to serve them might be extreme, but the author's initial refusal to tip after the bartender's action complicates things.\n\nIn terms of who's at fault, it's a bit of a gray area. The bartender shouldn't have added the tip without consent, but the author's response of giving nothing in return after that could be seen as a breach of social etiquette. The author's justification is that the bartender shouldn't take advantage of a drunk person, but the author was the one who chose to drink and then make a decision under the influence. It's possible that both sides have some responsibility here, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nIf the standard is that tipping is expected, then the author didn't tip and caused a conflict, which could make them \"the one in the wrong.\" However, if the bartender acted improperly by adding the tip without permission, the author might have a valid point. But since the author chose to not tip at all, which is against the norm, even if the bartender made a mistake, the author's action could still be seen as wrong. So maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
