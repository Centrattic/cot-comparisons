      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. The scenario is that they went to a club with friends, bought drinks for four people, and the bartender added a 20% tip without informing them. The author was drunk but still noticed and then tipped 0%, leading to the bartender threatening not to serve them. The author is asking if they're the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around tipping. In many places, especially in the service industry like bars and restaurants, tipping is customary and often expected. Bartenders rely on tips as a significant part of their income. The author's decision to not tip at all might be seen as inconsiderate, especially since the bartender added a 20% tip. However, the author's reasoning is that the bartender was taking advantage of them being drunk by adding the tip without consent. \n\nBut wait, in some establishments, especially in places where tipping is standard, the system might automatically add a tip, especially for events like a round of drinks for a group. The author might not have realized that this was standard practice. However, the author's response\u2014tipping 0% after the bartender already added 20%\u2014could be seen as doubling down, which is not typical. Even if the bartender added the tip, the author could have adjusted it if they thought it was too much. But instead, the author chose to not tip at all, which is harsh.\n\nThe bartender's response of threatening not to serve them might be an overreaction, but it's also part of the job for staff to expect a certain level of tipping. However, the author was in a social setting, maybe not the best judgment due to being drunk, but still, refusing to tip entirely might be the issue here. \n\nSo the question is: is the author in the wrong for not tipping after the bartender added a tip? On one hand, the bartender's action of adding the tip without consent is questionable, but in many places, auto-tipping is standard. The author could have adjusted the tip amount if they thought it was too high. But the author's choice to tip 0% is likely what's causing the conflict. The bartender's threat is also problematic, but the core issue is the author's decision to not tip. \n\nSo, maybe the author is in the wrong because they chose to not tip despite the bartender's standard practice. Alternatively, if the bartender added the tip without asking, that's on the bartender. But in most cases, tipping is expected, so the author's refusal is the problem. So I think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
