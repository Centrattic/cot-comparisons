      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who didn't tip the bartender is in the wrong. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, invited four friends to drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing them. The person got drunk but wasn't too drunk to notice the bartender putting the tip. They then decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender responded by refusing to serve them unless they tipped. The person is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around tipping. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary for service workers like bartenders. The expectation is usually around 15-20%, but it's not mandatory. However, some establishments auto-add a tip, but they should inform the customer. If the bartender added a tip without mentioning it, that might be an issue. \n\nThe person here is upset because the bartender added a tip without consent. They were drunk but not intoxicated to the point of not noticing. They responded by not tipping, which led to the bartender threatening to refuse service. \n\nSo, the key points: Was the bartender allowed to add a tip without permission? If the bartender added a tip without the customer's knowledge, that's possibly against some policies or norms. Many places require that automatic gratuities be disclosed. If the bartender didn't inform them, that's on the bartender. However, the customer then decided to not tip at all, which could be seen as a reaction to the bartender's unauthorized tip. \n\nBut here's the catch: the customer was already paying for their own and friends' drinks. If the total included an unauthorized tip, the customer might feel that the bartender is taking advantage. However, in the US, the customer has the discretion to adjust the tip as they see fit. So if the customer decides to remove the tip or pay less, they have the right to do so, even if it's a reaction to the bartender's action. \n\nBut the bartender then refused to serve them. That's a problem because the bartender can't legally force a customer to tip. In many jurisdictions, refusing service because a customer doesn't tip is illegal. The service is provided, and the customer has paid for the drinks, so the bartender shouldn't deny service over a tip dispute. \n\nSo, the author's actions: they were within their rights to not tip, especially if the bartender added it without consent. The bartender overstepped by refusing service. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
