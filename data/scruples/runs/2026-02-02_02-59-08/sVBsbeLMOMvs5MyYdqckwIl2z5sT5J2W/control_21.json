      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who didn't tip the bartender is in the wrong. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person went to a club with friends, invited four of them to four drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without asking. The person was drunk but still noticed and decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them if they didn't tip. The person is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are about tipping practices and the interaction between the customer and bartender. In many places, especially in the US, it's customary to tip service workers like bartenders. However, the twist here is that the bartender added the 20% tip without the customer's knowledge. Typically, tips are supposed to be voluntary, so the bartender might have overstepped by adding it without asking. \n\nThe customer, maybe because they noticed the bartender doing this, decided to tip 0% as a reaction. The bartender then refused service. Now, the question is whether the customer is in the wrong. \n\nOn one hand, the bartender added a tip without the customer's consent, which might be against standard practices. Some places automatically add a service charge, but usually, that's for large groups or events, not individual customers. If the bartender didn't inform the customer and added it without consent, that could be problematic. The customer's response was to not tip at all, which is a way of objecting. \n\nHowever, in many service industries, the expectation is that customers do tip. Even if the bartender did something wrong, refusing to pay the added tip might still leave the customer in a tricky spot. But the customer might have a valid point in protesting the unauthorized tip. \n\nAnother angle: the bartender threatening to not serve them if they didn't tip. That could be a violation of their rights. In some places, workers can't refuse service for not tipping, but it's more of a gray area. The customer's right to dispute the automatic tip might be on their side. \n\nSo, the bartender's actions were possibly inappropriate, and the customer's response, while harsh, might be a reaction to that. However, if the customer was drunk, maybe they acted impulsively. But the main issue is the bartender's unauthorized tip. \n\nI think the answer leans towards the customer not being in the wrong because the bartender added the tip without permission. The customer's right to not tip, especially if they felt pressured or the tip was unauthorized, might make them not at fault. So, the answer is B.\n"
