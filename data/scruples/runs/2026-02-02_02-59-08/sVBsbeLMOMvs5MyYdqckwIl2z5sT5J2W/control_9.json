      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. The scenario is that they went to a club, invited four friends for drinks, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing them. The author didn't tip, told the bartender not to take advantage of someone who's drunk, and the bartender refused to serve them. The options are A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around tipping. In many places, especially in the service industry, tipping is expected as part of the service. However, the bartender added the tip without telling the customer. Normally, the customer is responsible for adding a tip, even if the bartender suggests it. But in some places, the bill might automatically include a gratuity, especially in certain establishments. However, the key point here is that the customer wasn't informed, which is a problem. The author was drunk but not too drunk to notice the bartender adding the tip. \n\nSo the author's action was to not tip and confront the bartender for adding the tip without permission. The bartender then refused to serve them. Now, is the author in the wrong? Well, if the bartender was supposed to communicate the tip, and didn't, the customer might not be obligated to pay it. But typically, even if a tip is suggested, customers can choose not to add more. However, refusing to tip at all could be seen as rude. But in this case, the author didn't add a tip because the bartender added it without asking. The author's justification is that they didn't want to be taken advantage of while drunk. \n\nBut wait, the author was the one who invited friends to four drinks. Maybe the cost was higher, and the tip was expected. However, the bartender shouldn't have unilaterally added a tip without consent. The customer has the right to adjust the tip. The problem here is the communication. The bartender's approach was wrong because they didn't inform the customer. The author's response might be seen as reacting to the bartender's mistake. \n\nBut the author didn't tip at all, even though the bartender added 20%, so maybe the total tip was 20%? Wait, the author said they responded by tipping 0%, so the total tip would be 20% from the bartender's input. But the author was supposed to add their own tip. If the bartender added 20%, maybe the customer intended to tip but decided not to because of the bartender's action. \n\nIn this situation, the author might not be in the wrong because the bartender shouldn't have added the tip without permission. However, the author's choice to not tip anything could be seen as inconsiderate. But given the circumstances, the bartender's error might justify the author's response. So the answer might be B (not wrong).\n"
