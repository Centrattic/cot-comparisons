      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. The scenario is that they went to a club, invited four friends to drinks, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing them. The writer noticed, got upset, and tipped 0%, leading to the bartender refusing to serve them again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around tipping. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary for service workers like bartenders. It's often expected to tip a percentage, usually 15-20%, as part of the total bill. However, the key issue here is that the bartender added a 20% tip without the customer's knowledge. That's a bit unusual because typically, the customer is supposed to decide the tip amount, not the server adding it automatically.\n\nThe writer was drunk but not too drunk to notice the bartender's action. They felt the bartender was taking advantage of their state. They responded by not tipping, which led to a confrontation. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them again if they didn't tip. \n\nNow, the question is whether the writer is at fault. On one hand, the bartender's action of adding a tip without permission might be the problem. Tipping is a customer's choice, and the server shouldn't impose their own judgment. However, in some establishments, automatic gratuities are added for large parties or during peak times, but that's usually communicated beforehand. If this wasn't a standard policy, the bartender overstepped. \n\nThe writer's response was to leave zero tip, which could be seen as a protest. But by not tipping at all, they're violating the usual expectation, which might be seen as rude. However, the bartender's action was also inappropriate. The writer might have felt disrespected. \n\nThe bartender's response of refusing service if they don't tip is problematic too. Service staff shouldn't threaten to not serve customers over a tip, especially if the customer is disputing the practice. \n\nSo, considering these points, the writer might be in the wrong for not tipping, but the bartender also acted inappropriately by adding the tip without consent. However, the question is specifically about the writer's fault. The writer's decision not to tip could be justified if they felt the bartender was taking advantage of their state. But in general, even if the bartender was wrong, the writer's response (0% tip) is against the norm. So, maybe the writer is partially at fault. \n\nBut in the AITA context, people often expect the customer to follow the norm. Even if the bartender did something wrong, the writer's refusal to tip might still be seen as inconsiderate. Hence, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong). But I need to make sure. Let me check again. The bartender added the tip without permission, which is a problem. The writer's response was to not tip, which is a personal choice but might be seen as inconsiderate. However, the bartender's action was also wrong. But since the question is only about the writer's fault, maybe the answer is A. Or maybe B because the bartender was wrong first. Hmm. This is tricky. In AITA scenarios, often people are judged based on their actions regardless of others' mistakes. So if the writer didn't tip when expected, they might be considered at fault, even if the bartender's action was wrong. So the answer might be A.\n"
