      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who didn't tip their bartender is in the wrong. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, invited four friends to drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without asking, and the user, who was a bit drunk but not too drunk, responded by not tipping and told the bartender not to take advantage. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them if they didn't tip. The user is now asking if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider tipping norms. In many places, especially in the service industry like bars, tipping is customary and expected. Bartenders rely on tips as part of their income, so not tipping can be seen as rude or disrespectful. However, the user's reasoning is that the bartender added the tip without permission, which made them uncomfortable. \n\nThe user was drunk but not enough to not notice the bartender's action. So they might have felt that the bartender was taking advantage of their possibly impaired state. But is that a valid reason to not tip? \n\nThe bartender's response was to refuse service if they didn't tip. That's a bit aggressive, but bartenders do sometimes enforce tipping policies. However, the user's initial action of not tipping could be seen as a stand against the bartender's action, but maybe they didn't consider that the tip is part of the service cost.\n\nOn one hand, the user is standing up for themselves against what they perceived as unfair tipping. On the other, they didn't tip at all, which might be considered inconsiderate to the bartender who relies on tips. \n\nTipping is often a social norm, not a legal requirement. So if the user chooses not to tip, they might not be \"wrong\" in a legal sense, but socially, it's frowned upon. The bartender adding the tip without asking might be against some places' policies, but maybe it's standard there. \n\nThe user's response of 0% tip could be seen as a direct reaction to the bartender's action, but it's disrespectful regardless. The bartender's refusal to serve is also a bit extreme, but it's their choice as a service provider. \n\nSo, the user might be in the wrong because they didn't tip, which is expected, even if the bartender added it without permission. Alternatively, the bartender's action was wrong, making the user's response a justified stand. \n\nBut in most cases, the expectation is that you tip for good service, and refusing to do so, even if there's a misunderstanding, could be seen as the user being in the wrong. The bartender might have been in the wrong for adding the tip without consent, but the user's response was also inappropriate. \n\nHowever, the user was drunk, which might have affected their judgment. Still, the responsibility is on the bartender to follow proper protocols. If the bartender added the tip without the user's consent, that's a breach of service norms. But the user's zero tip is a harsh response. \n\nIn the end, the user is likely in the wrong because they didn't tip at all, but the situation is a bit ambiguous. The bartender also made a mistake by adding the tip without asking. The user's action might be seen as a valid response to the bartender's mistake, but it's still not following the usual tipping etiquette. \n\nSo, the answer might lean towards the user being in the wrong (A), but there's nuance. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, considering standard social expectations, the answer is likely A.\n"
