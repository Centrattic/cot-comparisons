      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who didn't tip the bartender is in the wrong. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, bought drinks for four people, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing them. The author got drunk but not too drunk to notice, and then decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of people who are drunk. The bartender then said he won't serve them if they don't tip. The user's opinion is that the author is in the wrong, but they want to know what I think.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around tipping. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary and often expected. Bartenders rely on tips as a significant part of their income. However, the key point here is that the bartender added the tip without informing the customer. Normally, when you pay by card, the tip is added only after the customer approves. If the bartender added it without consent, that could be an issue. The customer might feel deceived or taken advantage of, especially if they were under the influence.\n\nThe author's response was to tip 0%, which could be seen as a protest against the unauthorized tip. But the act of not tipping at all, even if the service was good, is generally frowned upon. However, the bartender's actions might have been a mistake or an attempt to get more money by not informing the customer. The author's reasoning is that the bartender shouldn't take advantage of someone who's drunk, which is understandable. But is the author wrong for not tipping in this case?\n\nOn one hand, the bartender's action of adding the tip without permission was inappropriate. On the other, the author's response of not tipping could harm the bartender, who might rely on that income. It's a bit of a conflict between the customer's right to control their tipping and the employee's reliance on tips. \n\nIn many places, the law requires that tips be added with the customer's consent. If the bartender added the tip without asking, that's a breach of standard practice. The author's reaction, while harsh, could be seen as a response to an initial wrongdoing. However, not tipping at all, even if the service was good, is generally considered rude. The author could have refused the unauthorized tip and then tipped an appropriate amount themselves. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the bartender made a mistake by adding the tip without consent, the author's response might be justified as a protest. But if the author had the opportunity to correct the tip amount after the fact and chose not to tip at all, that could be seen as going too far. However, the bartender's refusal to serve them might have been an overreaction as well. \n\nI think the key here is whether the unauthorized tip was a mistake or an intentional act. If it was a mistake, the author's response might be understandable. But if it was intentional, the author's protest is valid. However, the act of not tipping in response could still be seen as inconsiderate. So, the answer might be that the author is somewhat in the wrong, but not entirely. However, given the options (A or B), the user is asking for a binary choice. \n\nIn many cases, the expectation is to tip, regardless of the situation. If the author felt wronged, they could have addressed it by removing the unauthorized tip and then adding their own. Not tipping at all is a stronger action that might be seen as inconsiderate, unless there was a direct issue with the service. Since the service wasn't mentioned as bad, the author's action was based on the unauthorized tip. However, the bartender's job is to serve, and refusing to serve is also a problem. \n\nIn conclusion, both parties made mistakes, but the author's primary error was not tipping without a clear reason related to service quality. So, the answer might lean towards A, but I'm a bit conflicted. However, given the options, I think the author is in the wrong because they didn't tip despite the bartender's mistake, which could be handled more gracefully.\n"
