      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, bought four drinks for their group. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing them. The person got mad, set the tip to 0%, and told the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then refused to serve them if they didn't tip. The person claims they wanted to tip but were upset about the bartender adding the tip without permission.\n\nFirst, standard tipping etiquette in many places, especially in the US, is around 15-20%. So the bartender adding 20% seems within normal range. However, the key issue here is that the bartender added it without the customer's knowledge. That's a problem because customers should have control over their own tips. If the bartender is supposed to be handling the payment, they shouldn't be making unilateral decisions about the tip amount. That could be a breach of trust or policy.\n\nThe customer was drunk but not incapacitated. They noticed the bartender changing the tip, which suggests they were still coherent enough to make decisions. The customer's response was to zero out the tip, which is a direct reaction to the bartender's unauthorized action. The bartender then refused service, which might be against company policy. I've heard that some places don't allow employees to refuse service based on tipping, as that could create a conflict of interest. \n\nSo, the bartender's actions (adding the tip without permission) might have been the initial wrongdoing. The customer, while perhaps upset, was asserting their right to decide their own tip. The bartender's refusal to serve them after that could be seen as retaliatory, which isn't acceptable. Therefore, the customer isn't necessarily in the wrong here. The main issue is the bartender's lack of transparency, not the customer's refusal to tip after being misled. \n\nBut there's also the context of the customer being drunk. If they were under the influence, maybe their judgment was impaired. However, they still acted on a grievance they had. The bartender's threat to not serve them if they didn't tip might be an overreaction, especially if the customer intended to tip but was upset about the unauthorized addition. So, the customer's action, while perhaps confrontational, was a response to the bartender's inappropriate behavior. Therefore, the customer isn't entirely at fault here. The answer would likely be B (not in the wrong).\n"
