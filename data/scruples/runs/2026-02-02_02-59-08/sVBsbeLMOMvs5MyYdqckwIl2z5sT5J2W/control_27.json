      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves not tipping the bartender because the bartender added a 20% tip without asking. The writer was drunk but still noticed and decided to tip 0%, leading to a confrontation where the bartender refused to serve them anymore. \n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms around tipping. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is expected as part of service jobs. Bartenders, servers, etc., often rely on tips as a significant portion of their income. So, expecting a tip is part of their job.\n\nThe writer invited four friends to four drinks, so the total bill might be a few hundred dollars. The bartender added 20% without asking. The writer, while drunk, noticed this and decided to tip 0%, accusing the bartender of taking advantage. The bartender then refused to serve them.\n\nNow, the question is whether the writer is in the wrong. The key points here are: 1) Was the bartender allowed to add a tip? 2) Was the writer's response appropriate?\n\nIn terms of the first point, some places allow automatic gratuities for groups or large parties, but usually, it's the establishment's policy, not the individual bartender's decision. If the bartender unilaterally added a tip without the customer's consent, that could be problematic. However, in many cases, tips are left to the customer's discretion. The writer felt disrespected that the bartender assumed control over the tip amount.\n\nRegarding the second point, the writer's decision to not tip at all is a response to what they perceived as the bartender overstepping. However, refusing to tip entirely, especially in a culture where tipping is standard, is seen as disrespectful and harmful to the server's income. The writer might have a point if the bartender shouldn't have added the tip without consent, but their retaliation by not tipping at all could be seen as harsh.\n\nAnother angle is the writer's state of being drunk. While they were intoxicated, they were still aware enough to notice the tip being added. Drunkenness doesn't absolve someone from responsibility, but it might affect judgment. However, the bartender's refusal to serve could be a policy of the establishment, which might have rules about serving customers who refuse to tip.\n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole), the community often considers the intent and the impact. The writer's intent was to not let the bartender decide the tip, but the impact was not tipping, which affects the bartender's income. The bartender's intent was to receive a tip, but the method of adding it without asking might have been wrong. However, the refusal to serve is a standard response in some places for customers who refuse to tip.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the bartender had the right to add the tip. If it's against the establishment's policy for the bartender to do that, then the writer might have a valid reason. But if the bartender was within their rights, then the writer's response could be seen as the issue. However, in many cases, the customer should have the final say on the tip amount. Therefore, the writer might not be entirely at fault, but their choice to tip 0% could be seen as harsh. Alternatively, the bartender's actions were wrong, so the writer isn't in the wrong for reacting, but their reaction was extreme.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer might lean towards B (No), because the bartender's action of adding a tip without consent could be the issue, and the writer's response, while extreme, was a reaction to that. However, some might argue that the writer should have just paid the tip and addressed it with management instead of refusing to tip. But given the situation, the writer's perspective is that they were being taken advantage of, which might make their action understandable.\n"
