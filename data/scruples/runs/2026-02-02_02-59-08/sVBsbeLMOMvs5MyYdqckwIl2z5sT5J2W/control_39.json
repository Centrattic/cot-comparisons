      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who didn't tip their bartender is in the wrong. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, invited four people to four drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing them. The person got drunk but wasn't too drunk to notice. They responded by tipping 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them if they didn't tip. The person was willing to tip an appropriate amount but was upset about the automatic 20% being added without their knowledge.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around tipping. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary for services like bartending, usually around 15-20%. However, if the establishment automatically adds a tip, that's a business decision. The user might feel that the bartender was taking advantage by not informing them, but in reality, the bartender might be following the club's policy. The key point here is whether the automatic tip was part of the establishment's policy or the bartender's own action. If it was the club's policy, the bartender isn't personally adding the tip. If it was the bartender's own initiative, then maybe he's overstepping. However, the user's response of not tipping at all could be seen as inconsiderate, especially if the bartender relies on tips for income. The user's argument is that the bartender shouldn't assume how much to tip, but in many places, the tip is meant to be a voluntary gesture. The user's decision to tip 0% might be considered rude or inconsiderate regardless of the bartender's actions. The bartender's response to refuse service might be within his rights if the establishment's policy requires tips. So, the user's actions could be seen as inconsiderate, making them at fault. But if the bartender added the tip without the user's knowledge, maybe the user has a point in feeling disrespected. However, not tipping at all is a strong response. I think the user is in the wrong because even if they felt the tip was added improperly, they could have addressed it by paying a different amount or asking about the policy, but not tipping at all is unkind. The bartender might have been following policy, and the user's reaction was excessive.\n"
