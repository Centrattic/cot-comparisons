      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who didn't tip their bartender is in the wrong. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, bought them drinks, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without asking. The person was drunk but not too drunk to notice. They then left a 0% tip, told the bartender not to take advantage, and the bartender refused to serve them. The user thinks the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider standard tipping practices. In many places, especially in the US, it's customary to tip service staff like bartenders 15-20%. However, the key point here is that the bartender added the tip without informing the customer. Normally, the customer decides the tip amount, so if the bartender added it without permission, that might be an issue. However, some establishments automatically add a gratuity for large groups or events, but the customer should be informed.\n\nThe person was drunk but not to the point of not noticing. They responded by zeroing out the tip, which could be seen as a reaction to the bartender's action. The bartender then threatened not to serve them if they didn't tip. That's a bit aggressive because refusing service over a tip might be their right, but it's a strong response.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? If the bartender added the tip without permission, the customer might have a valid reason to adjust it. However, the standard expectation is that you tip service staff. By leaving 0%, the author is going against the norm, which could be seen as wrong. But the bartender's action of adding the tip without notice complicates things. The author might have felt disrespected or taken advantage of, leading to their reaction.\n\nBut in terms of right and wrong, the author's choice to not tip could be considered wrong because tipping is expected, even if the bartender made a mistake. The author could have corrected the tip amount appropriately, like 15-20%, instead of zeroing it. Alternatively, if the bartender added it without notice, maybe the author should have asked to adjust it. The author's response was confrontational, which isn't the best approach, but the root issue is whether not tipping is acceptable.\n\nSo, the answer might hinge on whether the bartender's action of adding the tip without notice was a mistake, and the author's reaction was an overcorrection. The author is in the wrong because not tipping is against the norm, even though the situation was confusing. The bartender also acted improperly by not informing the customer but perhaps had the right to refuse service if the customer wasn't tipping. However, the main question is about the author's actions. Since they didn't tip despite the bartender's error, they're likely in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
