      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author went to a club with friends, bought four drinks for them. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without asking. The author was drunk but could still notice this. They decided to tip 0%, saying the bartender shouldn't take advantage of people who are drunk. The bartender then refused to serve them if they didn't tip. The author claims they wanted to tip an appropriate amount but were upset about the automatic 20% being added without consent.\n\nFirst, I need to consider standard tipping practices. In many places, especially in the service industry like bars or restaurants, it's customary to tip between 15-20%. However, the key here is that the bartender added the tip without informing the customer. That's unusual because usually, the customer is aware of the tip amount they're leaving, either by adding it manually or through an honor system. Automatically adding a tip without the customer's knowledge might be seen as deceptive or against the customer's autonomy.\n\nThe author's response was to leave 0%, which they justified because they didn't want the bartender to take advantage. However, by doing so, they ended up not tipping at all, which is below the standard. The bartender then refused service, which could be within his rights if the policy is to require tipping, though in some places, employees can't refuse service for not tipping.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's reasoning is that the bartender shouldn't have added the tip without permission. But maybe the author could have adjusted the tip after noticing. Alternatively, they could have asked the bartender to remove the automatic tip. Instead, they left nothing, which might be seen as an overreaction. However, the bartender's action of adding the tip without consent is problematic. The author might feel they were being coerced into a higher tip, which isn't fair.\n\nOn the other hand, the standard expectation is to tip, so even if the bartender made a mistake, the customer's responsibility is to correct it politely. The author's approach was confrontational, leading to the bartender refusing service. That might have escalated the situation unnecessarily. So, the author's mistake could be in reacting with zero tipping instead of addressing it more diplomatically, like asking to adjust the tip amount after realizing the error.\n\nBut the initial action by the bartender was the root issue. The customer had a right to be informed. If the bartender's practice is to add a tip without consent, that's unethical. The author's reaction is a response to that unethical action. However, the author's own action of not tipping at all is not in line with standard practices, regardless of the bartender's mistake.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the author is partially at fault for not responding in a way that still adheres to tipping norms, even if the bartender made an error. The correct approach would have been to point out the mistake and then decide on an appropriate tip amount. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not tipping 0% despite the bartender's error.\n"
