      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So the situation is that they went to a club with friends, invited four friends for drinks, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The author was drunk but still noticed this and tipped 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them if they didn't tip. The author is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to think about tipping norms. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is expected in service industries like bars and restaurants. The standard is often around 15-20%, right? So if the bartender added 20% automatically, maybe that's part of their policy. But the author didn't know about this and thought the bartender was trying to take advantage. However, the author had previously invited their friends for drinks, which might mean they were already paying for the drinks. So maybe they didn't expect an additional tip? Wait, but when you pay the bill at a bar, even if you're buying drinks for friends, you still tip the bartender. Tipping is separate from the cost of the drinks. So if the bartender added 20%, maybe the author should have known that's normal, even if they were drunk. \n\nBut the key point here is that the bartender added the tip without informing them. The author is upset about that and decided to tip 0% in response. The bartender then refused service if they didn't tip. Now, is the author at fault here? \n\nWell, the author's reasoning is that they didn't want to be taken advantage of, especially when drunk. But if the bartender's policy is to add a standard tip, then maybe they should have mentioned it. However, in some places, it's common for the bill to include a gratuity automatically, especially in clubs or high-end places. The author might not have been aware of that. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's response was to leave 0% after the bartender had already added 20%. If the total was higher than expected because of the tip, the author could have pointed out the tip and maybe asked to remove it, but instead they left nothing, which is below the standard. So maybe the author's action of not tipping at all is worse than just removing the added tip. \n\nAlso, the bartender's response of refusing service if they didn't tip seems a bit extreme, but maybe he's within his rights to refuse service if a customer is being disrespectful or not following the tipping policy. \n\nSo considering all this, the author might be at fault because they didn't tip appropriately, even if they thought the bartender was adding the tip without permission. Tipping is customary, and even if the bartender added it automatically, the author could have adjusted the tip instead of leaving 0%. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
