      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that they went to a club, invited four friends for drinks, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without asking. The author was drunk but noticed, then tipped 0% and told the bartender not to take advantage of people. The bartender refused to serve them unless they tipped. The author is asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around tipping. In many places, especially in the service industry like bars and restaurants, tipping is customary. Bartenders rely on tips as part of their income, so expecting a certain amount is common. However, the key point here is that the bartender added the tip without informing the customer. Normally, when you pay by card, the tip is optional, and you can choose or adjust it. If the bartender preemptively added 20%, that might be unusual. \n\nNow, the author was drunk but not too drunk to notice. They responded by zeroing out the tip and confronting the bartender. The bartender then refused to serve them. So the author's action was to remove the tip they felt was forced, and the bartender's response was to deny service. \n\nFrom a service perspective, the bartender's job is to serve customers, but they also have the right to refuse service if a customer is being rude or not tipping. However, the initial act of adding the tip without the customer's consent might be problematic. If the customer didn't agree to the tip, the bartender shouldn't have added it. Then the customer's response was to remove it, which could be seen as standing up for themselves against an unauthorized charge. \n\nBut in typical tipping culture, even if the tip is customary, the customer has the right to decide the amount. If the bartender added 20% without asking, maybe the customer is within their right to adjust it. However, by tipping 0%, the customer might be violating the social norm of tipping, which could justify the bartender's refusal to serve. \n\nOn the other hand, if the bartender added the tip without consent, that's an overreach. The customer might have a right to correct that. But the customer's approach was to confront the bartender and zero out the tip, which could come off as rude. The bartender's refusal to serve could be a business decision to not deal with that situation. \n\nSo, the author's actions might have been a misunderstanding of the tipping process. If the tip was automatically added, maybe they should have just adjusted it to an appropriate amount they were willing to pay. By zeroing it and confronting the bartender, they might have overstepped, leading to the bartender's refusal. Therefore, the author could be at fault for not just adjusting the tip to a reasonable amount instead of removing it entirely and being confrontational. \n\nBut if the tip wasn't supposed to be added without consent, then the bartender is at fault for adding it. In that case, the customer's response is justified. However, in many places, especially in the US, tipping is expected, so even if the tip was added without asking, the customer might still be expected to pay some amount. \n\nI think the key points here are: the bartender added the tip without asking, which is unusual. The customer's response was to remove it and confront, which led to the conflict. If the customer had simply adjusted the tip to a lower amount, maybe the issue wouldn't have happened. But by zeroing it, they might have been violating the expectation of tipping. The bartender's refusal to serve could be based on the customer refusing to tip, but the initial addition of the tip was possibly the bartender's mistake. \n\nSo, the author might be partially at fault for reacting in a confrontational way and not just adjusting the tip. However, the bartender also shouldn't have added the tip without consent. But in the context of the question, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. Considering the norm of tipping and the customer's response of zeroing the tip and being confrontational, the author might be in the wrong because they refused to tip entirely, even if the initial tip was added without consent. The appropriate action might have been to adjust the tip to a lower amount instead of removing it. So, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
