      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about not tipping a bartender because the bartender added a 20% tip without informing them.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics of tipping in bars. In many places, especially in the US, tipping bartenders is customary, and they often rely on tips as part of their income. However, the situation here is a bit different because the bartender added the tip automatically without telling the customer. The customer got drunk but was still coherent enough to notice this and decided to leave a 0% tip instead, leading to the bartender refusing to serve them.\n\nNow, the key points here are: the bartender added the tip without asking, the customer was drunk but not too drunk to notice, and the customer's response was to not tip at all. The bartender then threatened not to serve them if they didn't tip. \n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the bartender might have thought that adding a default tip is standard, but they should have informed the customer. On the other hand, the customer, though drunk, made a conscious decision to not tip because of that action. But is it customary to tip even in such cases? Also, the customer's response might be seen as a reaction to the bartender's actions, but not tipping entirely could be seen as harsh. However, if the bartender added the tip without permission, maybe the customer is within their rights to refuse. \n\nAnother angle: some places have automatic gratuities for large groups or certain services, but the customer might not be aware of that. If the bartender didn't inform them, that's an issue. But in a bar setting, maybe automatic tips aren't as common as in restaurants. The customer might not expect it, so being upset is understandable. \n\nThe customer's decision to not tip could be seen as a protest against the bartender's action, but the consequence was that the bartender refused service. That might not be fair, but the customer's action in not tipping might be justified if they felt coerced or if the tip wasn't their choice. However, the expectation of tipping in such services is strong, so maybe the customer is being unreasonable by not tipping at all. \n\nAlso, the customer was drunk. While not an excuse, it's a factor. But they were aware enough to notice the tip and respond. So maybe they made a conscious choice. \n\nIn terms of social norms, if someone adds a tip without asking, it's considered rude, and the customer is within their right to correct that. However, the response of giving zero tip might be extreme. A more appropriate response might have been to adjust the tip after being informed. \n\nThe bartender's response of refusing service might be over the top, but if the customer is causing a scene, maybe that's their right. However, the customer's action is the root. \n\nI think the main issue here is that the bartender didn't explain the automatic tip, which is a problem. But the customer's decision to tip zero could be seen as a justified reaction to that. However, in the context of typical tipping culture, customers are expected to tip regardless, so maybe the customer is in the wrong because they didn't tip even though the bartender made a mistake. Alternatively, the bartender should have informed them. \n\nThis is tricky. The answer might depend on cultural norms. In some places, automatic tips are standard, but the customer might not know. If the bartender didn't inform, then the customer's response is understandable. But if the norm is to tip regardless, then the customer is wrong. \n\nHmm. I think the author is in the wrong because they didn't tip at all, even though the bartender made a mistake. The appropriate action would be to adjust the tip after being informed, not to refuse to tip entirely. So the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, the bartender's error in not informing could exonerate the customer. \n\nWait, but the customer had the opportunity to correct the tip once they noticed it. If they were aware, they should have adjusted it. Instead, they left zero, which is a harsh response. So maybe the author is in the wrong. So answer A.\n"
