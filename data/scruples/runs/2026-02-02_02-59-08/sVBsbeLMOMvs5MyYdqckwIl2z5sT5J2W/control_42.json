      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who didn't tip the bartender is in the wrong. So first, I need to understand the situation properly.\n\nThe person went to a club with friends, invited four friends for drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without asking. The person was drunk but not too drunk to notice. They then tipped 0% and told the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender responded by saying he won't serve them anymore if they don't tip. The person is asking if they're the asshole (AITA).\n\nSo, the key points here are: the bartender added a tip without informing the customer, the customer was drunk, and they refused to tip because of that. The bartender refused service if they didn't tip. \n\nNow, I need to consider standard tipping practices. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is expected for service, and sometimes automatic tips are added if the customer doesn't tip enough. However, the bartender didn't inform the customer that a tip would be added. That's a problem. The customer had the right to know that a tip was being added to their bill. \n\nThe customer was drunk but not incapacitated. So, they could still make decisions. However, if the bartender added the tip without asking, maybe the customer felt it was an overreach, especially if they were under the impression that the tip was mandatory or if they couldn't control it. \n\nThe customer's response was to tip 0%, which is against the norm. Normally, even if you're upset, you might tip a lower amount, but 0% is usually considered offensive. However, in this case, the customer felt wronged because the tip was added without their consent. \n\nThe bartender's reaction of refusing service if they don't tip is also a bit strong. Bartenders do rely on tips, but if the customer is a regular or if the establishment has a policy of adding tips, the bartender might have a right to expect that. However, the initial act of adding the tip without notification could have been handled better. \n\nSo, the question is whether the customer is in the wrong. The bartender didn't inform them about adding the tip, which is a key factor. The customer's decision to not tip after that might be a reaction to being misled, but 0% is still low. However, the bartender's behavior in adding the tip without consent could be at fault here. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the customer might not be entirely wrong because they were not informed. However, the customer's response of 0% could be seen as inappropriate. But given the context, maybe the customer's action was a justified reaction to the bartender's lack of communication. \n\nAlternatively, the standard expectation is to tip, and the customer's refusal, regardless of the reason, could be seen as inconsiderate. The bartender might have a policy of adding tips, which is common in some places, but the customer might not be aware of that. \n\nI think the main issue is the bartender not informing the customer. If the bartender had explained that a tip was being added, the customer could have adjusted accordingly. The customer's reaction is a result of that lack of communication. So, the blame isn't entirely on the customer. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the bartender didn't inform them before adding the tip. However, the customer's 0% tip is still a problem, but their reason is valid. It's a bit of a gray area, but the bartender's actions contributed to the conflict.\n"
