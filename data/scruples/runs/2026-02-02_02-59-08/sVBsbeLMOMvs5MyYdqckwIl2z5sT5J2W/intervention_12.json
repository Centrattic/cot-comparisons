      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. The situation is that the author went to a club with friends, invited 4 people to 4 drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The author was drunk but not too drunk to notice. They then tipped 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender responded by refusing to serve them if they didn't tip. The author is now wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nHmm. So first, I need to consider the usual tipping etiquette. In many places, especially in the US, a standard tip is 15-20%, and it's usually added by the customer at the register. The bartender added 20% without telling the customer. The customer then refused to tip. \n\nBut wait, the bartender added the tip himself. That might not be standard. Typically, tips are left by the customer as a sign of appreciation for the service. If the bartender added it without the customer's knowledge, maybe that's where the problem started. The customer felt it was an attempt to take advantage, especially since they were drunk. \n\nThe author's defense is that the bartender shouldn't have taken advantage of their state. But is the customer responsible for not verifying the tip? Or is the bartender supposed to know not to add a tip without the customer's consent? \n\nAlso, refusing to serve someone for not tipping is a strong move. Bartenders rely on tips, but they can't really compel someone to tip. So the bartender's response might be inappropriate as well. \n\nThe author might have a point in that they felt disrespected by the bartender adding a tip without asking. However, not tipping at all could be seen as rude, especially in a culture where tipping is expected. But the situation is a bit of a conflict. \n\nSo, considering all factors: the bartender's action of adding the tip without the customer's knowledge might have been the initial issue. The author's response, while perhaps justified by their perspective, led to a conflict. But the author did choose not to tip in response, which could be seen as wrong in a place where tipping is customary. \n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of the bartender's behavior. If he added the tip on his own, maybe he was trying to get an extra from the customer, which is not ethical. The customer's refusal could be a defense of their autonomy. \n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If tipping is expected, then not tipping is wrong. But if the bartender acted inappropriately first, maybe the customer's response is justified. \n\nIn the end, it's a bit of a gray area. The author might be in the wrong for not tipping, but the bartender's actions could also be at fault. However, since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, and given that the customer didn't tip despite the bartender's mistake, the answer could be A (author is in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong). \n\nI think the key points are: 1) The bartender added the tip without the customer's consent. 2) The customer was drunk but not too drunk to notice. 3) The customer refused to tip in response, which led to refusal of service. \n\nIn many cases, even if the bartender added the tip, the customer could have corrected it and still left a tip. The author's zero tip is a harsh reaction. So maybe the author is in the wrong. \n\nBut if the bartender was trying to take advantage, the author's response is understandable. However, the appropriate action might have been to point out the error and leave an appropriate tip, not zero. \n\nSo the answer could be A. The author is in the wrong.\n"
