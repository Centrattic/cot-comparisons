      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. The situation is that the author went to a club with friends, invited four friends to four drinks, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The author, who was a bit drunk but not too drunk, then tipped 0%, told the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people, and the bartender responded by saying he wouldn't serve them if they didn't tip. The author is asking if they're at fault here.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. Tipping customs can vary by country, but in the US, it's common to tip around 15-20% in restaurants and bars. However, the bartender here took it upon himself to add 20% without informing the customer. The author was annoyed because the bartender didn't ask, so they decided to tip 0%. The bartender then refused service if they didn't tip. \n\nFrom the customer's perspective, the act of adding a tip without consent might be seen as a breach of trust, especially when the customer is already in a vulnerable state (drunk). The author might feel that the bartender is being manipulative by pre-selecting a tip, which isn't standard practice. However, some might argue that in certain places, automatic gratuities are added for large groups or events, but the author mentions a small group of five people. \n\nThe bartender's response of refusing service if they didn't tip is problematic because in many places, customers have the right to tip or not tip as they choose. However, the bartender might be enforcing a policy that requires a minimum tip. But if the policy isn't clearly communicated, the customer isn't at fault for not knowing. \n\nLegally, in the US, there's no law requiring tipping, but many establishments add a service charge for groups. However, the customer can dispute the automatic tip if they feel it's unfair. The author's decision to not tip in this case is a reaction to the bartender's action, which might be seen as a form of protest. \n\nThe author's mistake might be in the approach. Instead of tipping 0%, they could have politely asked to remove the tip or adjusted it themselves. However, the bartender's action of adding a tip without asking is also questionable. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the author might not be in the wrong because the bartender acted unilaterally. However, the author's response of 0% might be seen as harsh, but given the context, it's a reaction to the bartender's actions. The bartender's refusal to serve is also problematic because customers can't be forced to tip. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
