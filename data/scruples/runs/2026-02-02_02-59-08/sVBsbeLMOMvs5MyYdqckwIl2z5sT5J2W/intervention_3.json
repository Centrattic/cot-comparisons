      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for not tipping their bartender. The scenario is that the author and friends went to a club, the author invited four friends for drinks, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing the author. The author was drunk but not too drunk to notice and then tipped 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender responded by refusing to serve them unless they tipped. The author is wondering if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms around tipping. In many places, especially in the service industry like bars and restaurants, tipping is expected as part of the server's income. Bartenders often rely on tips for a significant portion of their earnings. However, the key point here is that the bartender added the 20% tip without the customer's knowledge or consent. Normally, when you pay by card, the system allows you to add a tip, but it's not automatically added unless the customer specifies. If the bartender unilaterally added the tip without asking, that's a problem because the customer has the right to decide their own tip amount.\n\nThe author, being drunk, might have been more vulnerable, but they mention they weren't too drunk to notice the tip being added. The author's response was to tip 0%, which could be seen as a deliberate act of defiance. However, the bartender's action of adding the tip without permission might be an overreach. The author's reasoning is that the bartender shouldn't take advantage of someone who's drunk, which is a valid point. On the other hand, refusing to serve a customer because they don't want to pay a tip could be seen as the bartender's error, as they can't force a customer to tip.\n\nBut here's the catch: in some places, especially in the US, tipping is customary, and not tipping can be considered rude. However, the bartender's action of automatically adding the tip without consent is also problematic. So the author might be in a gray area. The bartender has the right to refuse service, but the author's refusal to tip after the bartender's unauthorized action complicates things.\n\nAnother angle: the author invited friends, so maybe they were paying for multiple people. If the bartender added a tip without permission, the author might feel it's their responsibility to control the payment. The author's response might be justified if they felt misled, but the act of not tipping at all could be seen as harsh, especially if the bartender relies on such tips for their income.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the bartender shouldn't have unilaterally added the tip, which violates the customer's autonomy. The author's reaction, while perhaps impulsive due to being drunk, was a response to that unauthorized action. The bartender's refusal to serve is a possible consequence, but the initial mistake was the bartender's. So maybe the author isn't entirely at fault. However, not tipping in response could be seen as a poor choice, even if justified. So the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the bartender's action was the initial problem, and the author's reaction, while perhaps not the best, was a response to that.\n"
