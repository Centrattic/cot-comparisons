      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who didn't tip the bartender is at fault. The situation is that the person went to a club with friends, invited four friends to four drinks each. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing them. The person, who was drunk but not too drunk, decided to not tip and told the bartender not to take advantage of intoxicated customers. The bartender responded by refusing to serve them further, but the person was willing to tip an appropriate amount themselves.\n\nFirst, I need to consider standard tipping practices. In many places, especially in the US, 15-20% is typical for service like bartending. If the bartender added 20% without asking, maybe that's part of their policy. However, the customer might have the right to adjust the tip. The person's response was to leave 0%, which could be seen as confrontational. \n\nBut wait, the key issue here is that the bartender didn't inform them about the tip. Normally, when you pay a bill, the tip isn't automatically added unless it's a service charge that's clearly stated. If the bartender added it without notice, that could be problematic. The customer might feel it's deceptive, especially when they're drunk. But is it the customer's responsibility to check the total before paying? Or is the bartender at fault for adding a tip without permission?\n\nAlso, the person's response: telling the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. That's a strong statement. Maybe the bartender was just following a policy where they add a service charge, but the customer perceived it as taking advantage. However, in many clubs or bars, especially in nightlife where patrons might be intoxicated, it's possible that automatic tips are part of their policy. If that's the case, the person might be in the wrong for not paying it. But if the bartender added it without informing, maybe the person has a point.\n\nAnother angle: the person was willing to tip an appropriate amount themselves. So if they could have just adjusted it to a lower percentage, but instead set it to 0%, that could be seen as rude. But the initial action of the bartender might have been the inciting incident. \n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole), the community often looks at intentions and norms. If the bartender added the tip without consent, the person might not be in the wrong for objecting. However, if it's standard practice in the club to add a service charge, then the person might be in the wrong for trying to remove it. The person's response of 0% tip and confronting the bartender could be seen as escalating the situation. \n\nBut again, if the bartender didn't inform them, the person might not be at fault. It's a bit of a gray area. However, typically, in such scenarios, customers expect to tip, and even if they're drunk, they might still be responsible for paying the tip. The person's refusal to tip after the bartender added it could be seen as inconsiderate. But the bartender's action of adding without asking is also questionable. \n\nHmm. So maybe the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because the standard is to tip, and even if the bartender added it without permission, the appropriate action would be to adjust the tip rather than set it to 0%. Alternatively, B (No) if the bartender's action was wrong. But I'm leaning towards A because the person had the choice to tip an appropriate amount but chose not to, leading to conflict. However, the bartender's action of adding the tip without notice is also an issue. \n\nBut the person's defense is that they were willing to tip an appropriate amount. So maybe they just wanted to control the tip amount. But by setting it to 0%, they caused a problem. The bartender's response was to refuse service, which is within their rights perhaps, but the person's action of not tipping might be in the wrong. \n\nI think the key is that the person had the option to tip any amount they wanted. If they thought the automatic 20% was too much, they could have adjusted it down, but instead set it to 0%, which is not typical. So maybe the person is in the wrong. Therefore, answer A.\n"
