      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who didn't tip their bartender is in the wrong. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, invited four friends for drinks, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing them. The person was drunk but not too drunk to notice. They then tipped 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender responded by refusing to serve them unless they tipped. The person claims they were willing to tip an appropriate amount but were upset about the bartender adding the tip without consent.\n\nFirst, I need to consider standard tipping norms. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is expected in service industries like bartending. The usual range is 15-20%, so the bartender adding 20% is within that expectation. However, the key issue here is that the bartender added the tip without the customer's knowledge or consent. That's a bit of a problem because typically, a server might add a gratuity for large groups or events, but not without informing the customer. The customer then took offense and decided not to tip at all, leading to a confrontation.\n\nNow, the person is asking if they're at fault. The bartender's action of adding a tip without notice might be against standard practice. Some businesses have policies where gratuities are automatically added for groups or events, but the customer should be informed. If the bartender did this without the customer knowing, that's an issue. The customer's response was to not tip, which is technically in line with their right to decide their own tip amount. However, the customer could have escalated the issue by talking to management instead of refusing to tip, which led to the bartender refusing service.\n\nLegally, in many places, servers can't force a tip, but they can add a gratuity if it's part of the establishment's policy. However, if the policy isn't communicated, the customer might not be aware. The customer's action of not tipping could be seen as a reaction to being overcharged without consent. But in terms of social norms, even if the customer feels wronged, refusing to tip is a direct refusal of the service, which could be seen as inconsiderate, especially when the server is just following their job.\n\nThe person was drunk, which might affect their judgment. However, they claim they weren't too drunk to notice the tip being added. So, their decision to not tip was intentional. The bartender's refusal to serve them after that could be a policy of the establishment if they have a no-tipping rule, but in some places, servers can't refuse service without cause. \n\nIn terms of who's at fault, the bartender might have overstepped by adding the tip without consent, but the customer's response of not tipping zeroed out the tip, which is a common way to express dissatisfaction. However, causing a scene and refusing to tip might have been unnecessary. The person might be in the wrong because, even if the bartender added the tip improperly, the appropriate response would be to address it with management rather than withhold their own tip, which affects the server's income. Alternatively, if the establishment's policy allows for automatic gratuities, the customer should have been informed, so the bartender is partly at fault.\n\nBut the user's question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether the bartender had the right to add the tip without informing the customer. If the establishment allows that, the customer might be at fault for not tipping. If it's against policy, then the bartender is wrong. Since the scenario doesn't specify the establishment's policy, it's a bit ambiguous. However, generally, adding a tip without consent is not standard practice, so the bartender might be at fault for that. The customer's response of not tipping could be justified if they felt they were being overcharged. But refusing to tip might still be seen as inconsiderate. The answer might be that the customer is in the wrong because they could have handled it differently, like talking to management instead of retaliating by not tipping. But if the bartender added the tip improperly, then the customer has a point. It's a bit of a gray area, but the user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong. I think the answer is A.\n"
