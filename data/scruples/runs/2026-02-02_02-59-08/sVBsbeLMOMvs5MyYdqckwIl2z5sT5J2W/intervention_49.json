      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about not tipping a bartender after he automatically added a 20% tip. The user thinks the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author went to a club with friends, bought drinks for four people. The bartender added a 20% tip without telling the author. The author, who was drunk but not too drunk to notice, then tipped 0%, arguing against the bartender's automatic tip. The bartender then threatened not to serve him anymore if he didn't tip. The author claims he wanted to tip appropriately but was upset about the bartender's action.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author was wrong to not tip. In many places, tips are expected and often considered part of the service worker's income. Bartenders typically rely heavily on tips. If the bartender added a 20% tip automatically, maybe that's a standard practice in some places. However, the author might have felt this was unfair, especially if they were already paying for multiple friends. \n\nBut wait, even if the bartender added the tip without consulting, the appropriate response might have been to discuss or adjust the tip in person rather than leaving 0%. The author's reaction could be seen as confrontational. Also, the bartender's response of refusing service if the tip isn't given might be harsh, but the author's refusal to tip at all could be a problem.\n\nAnother angle: the author was drunk. While not too drunk to notice the tip, being under the influence might have led to an impulsive decision. However, that doesn't justify not tipping unless there was a valid reason, like poor service. The author didn't mention the service being bad, just the automatic tip. The bartender's action might be standard, but the author's zero tip could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nIn many cultures, tipping is a social norm, and not tipping is frowned upon regardless of the circumstances unless there's a justified reason. Here, the author's reason is the bartender adding the tip, but that's part of the system. If the author wanted to tip a different amount, they should have adjusted it. Instead, they left zero, which might be considered rude or unfair to the bartender.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong. They didn't communicate their intent to tip differently but instead left zero, leading to the bartender's refusal to serve. The proper action would have been to either adjust the tip as intended or perhaps ask the bartender about the automatic addition. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
