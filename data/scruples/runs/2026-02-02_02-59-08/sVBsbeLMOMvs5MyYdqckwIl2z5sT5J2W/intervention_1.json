      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who didn't tip their bartender is in the wrong. The situation is that the person invited four friends for drinks, went to a club, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing them. The person was drunk but not too drunk to notice. They responded by not tipping at all, saying the bartender shouldn't take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then refused to serve them unless they tipped. The person is asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around tipping. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary for service workers, including bartenders. However, the bartender here added a tip without the customer's knowledge or consent. That's a bit of a gray area because the customer might expect to choose their own tip amount. If the bartender is allowed to add a tip automatically, that could be seen as taking advantage, especially if the customer is under the influence.\n\nBut then, when the customer notices and refuses to tip, leading to a confrontation, is that the customer's fault? Well, the customer was drunk, which might have affected their judgment. However, they were still aware enough to notice the tip being added. The bartender's action of adding a tip without permission could be problematic. Some places have policies against forced tips, so that might be an issue. The customer's response of zero tipping in protest might be their way of asserting control after feeling manipulated.\n\nOn the other hand, refusing to tip entirely could be seen as inconsiderate to the bartender, who relies on tips for income. Even if the tip was added without consent, the customer could have chosen to leave an appropriate amount and addressed the issue with the management instead of confronting the bartender directly. That might have been a better approach to resolve the situation without causing a scene.\n\nSo, considering both sides: The bartender's action of adding a tip without consent is questionable, but the customer's response of not tipping at all might also be inconsiderate. However, the key point is whether the customer was wrong for not tipping. If the tip was added without permission, then the customer's refusal could be a justified reaction to being taken advantage of, especially if they were drunk. The bartender's refusal to serve them over the tip could be a separate issue, but the customer's main action was removing the tip, which was initially imposed without their knowledge. \n\nIn many places, tips are supposed to be discretionary. If the bartender added a tip without permission, that's against the customer's right to choose. Therefore, the customer might have a valid reason to remove it. However, leaving zero tip instead of a smaller amount might be seen as harsh. But given the circumstances, maybe it's understandable. So, the answer could be that the customer is not in the wrong because the bartender acted improperly by adding the tip without consent. Therefore, the correct answer is B (No).\n"
