      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not tipping their bartender. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, invited four friends to four drinks, paid, and the bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The person got drunk but was still aware enough to notice and then left 0% tip, leading to the bartender refusing service unless they tipped. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to recall typical tipping customs in the US. In many service jobs, especially in bars and restaurants, tipping is expected as part of the income for the service staff. The standard is usually around 15-20%, but it can vary based on the establishment and the service. However, some places automatically add a tip, which is a common practice to ensure servers get their expected income. \n\nIn this case, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing the customer. The customer was drunk but not so drunk that they couldn't notice it. The customer then decided not to tip, which led to the bartender refusing service. \n\nNow, the key points here: Was the customer wrong for not tipping? Well, the bartender added the tip automatically, which might be against the customer's preference. However, the customer's response was to leave 0% tip instead of accepting the automated one. The bartender then refused to serve them further. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the customer might feel that the automatic tip was unfair or excessive, especially if they were already paying for multiple drinks for their friends. However, in many places, the expectation is that you do tip, and not tipping is considered rude or unethical. The customer's argument is that the bartender shouldn't take advantage of people who are drunk to add a tip without permission. But being drunk doesn't negate the social expectation of tipping. \n\nAnother angle is that the bartender's action of adding the tip without informing the customer might be questionable. Some establishments do have automatic gratuities, especially for large groups or events, but it's usually disclosed beforehand. If this was a surprise, that might be part of the problem. However, the customer's response of refusing to tip entirely could be seen as extreme. Perhaps a more appropriate response would be to discuss it with the bartender, adjust the tip amount, or ask to remove the automatic tip. \n\nThe customer's decision to leave 0% might be seen as inconsiderate, especially if the server relies on tips for their income. On the other hand, the bartender's refusal to serve could be seen as excessive, but they have the right to refuse service. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the customer's action of not tipping after the automatic addition might be seen as inconsiderate, but the bartender's approach of adding a tip without consent could also be problematic. However, the expectation in many societies is that you do tip, so the customer might be at fault for refusing to tip entirely. \n\nBut wait, the customer was drunk. Does that affect their responsibility? Maybe, but they were still conscious enough to notice the tip being added. So, their decision to not tip might still be their own choice. However, the bartender's actions might have been the initial issue. \n\nIn conclusion, the customer's refusal to tip could be seen as wrong because they ignored the social norm, but the bartender's addition without consent could also be an issue. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the answer is A (Yes), it's because they didn't tip despite the norm. If B (No), because the bartender acted inappropriately. I need to decide based on societal norms and expectations. In the US, not tipping is generally frowned upon. Even if the tip was automatic, the customer could have adjusted the amount. So, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't tip, leading to conflict. Hence, answer A.\n"
