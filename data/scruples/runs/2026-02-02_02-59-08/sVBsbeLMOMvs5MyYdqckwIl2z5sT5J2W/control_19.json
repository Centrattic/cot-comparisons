      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author did the wrong thing by not tipping the bartender. So, first, the context: the author went to a club with friends, bought them drinks, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without asking. The author was drunk but not too much to notice. They then decided to tip 0%, told the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them if they didn't tip. The author is now wondering if they're at fault.\n\nHmm, I need to consider a few things here. First, tipping norms vary by culture and place. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary and expected for service workers like bartenders. It's often considered part of their compensation. So, if the bartender added a 20% tip, maybe that's standard, but the twist here is that the author didn't agree with the automatic tip and decided to tip nothing instead. \n\nThe key points here are consent and the expectation of tipping. The author felt the bartender was taking advantage by adding the tip without permission. But the bartender might have assumed that a tip was expected and necessary. So, the conflict arises from the author's refusal to tip after the bartender tried to add it unilaterally. \n\nNow, the author's actions: they didn't tip and confronted the bartender. The bartender then refused service. Is the author in the wrong? Well, if tipping is part of the standard practice, refusing to tip could be seen as violating social norms. However, the bartender's action of adding a tip without asking could be considered overstepping. The author's response, while perhaps rude or confrontational, might come from a place of feeling disrespected by the bartender's assumption.\n\nBut wait, in some places, especially in clubs or certain venues, service charges (like a tip added automatically) are common. The author might have been under the impression that the tip was being added to their own account, not the bartender's. But the bartender's response of refusing service if they don't tip seems a bit strong. However, in the US, customers can choose not to tip, but it's generally expected. So the author's action might have been a breach of social etiquette, leading to the bartender's refusal.\n\nBut the author did notice the tip being added and chose to remove it. The bartender's initial action might have been within policy (if the club has an automatic gratuity), but if the club allows individual discretion, then the author's choice to not tip could be their right. However, if the tip was supposed to go to the bartender, then the author's removal might be seen as taking back what was intended as a tip, hence the bartender's objection.\n\nAnother angle: being drunk. The author was drunk but not too drunk to notice the bartender's action. So, they were aware enough to make a decision. The bartender might argue that the customer was impaired, but the customer was still conscious and made a deliberate choice.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, if the club had a policy of adding tips, the author should have known that. But if it's the bartender's own initiative to add a tip, that's different. Also, the author's response of telling the bartender not to take advantage could be seen as justified if the bartender was indeed adding a personal tip without the customer's knowledge, which is unethical.\n\nBut in many service industries, tips are part of the employee's income, and sometimes places do add automatic gratuities, especially for large groups or events. If that's the case, the customer might have agreed to the terms when entering the club. However, if the bartender added it without the club's policy, it's more problematic.\n\nSo, the author's mistake might be in not tipping at all, which is against the norm, but the bartender's mistake was adding a tip without the customer's consent. However, the author's decision to tip 0% after the bartender added 20% could be seen as a reaction to the bartender's unauthorized action. But the author's response was to not tip, which might be within their rights, but it's socially unaccepted and could lead to conflict. The bartender's refusal to serve is a possible consequence, but in some places, refusing service if a customer doesn't tip is illegal.\n\nWait, in the US, it's illegal to require a tip, but customers can choose not to tip. However, if a business adds a service charge to the bill, that's different from the customer's personal tip. The author might be conflating the two. If the bartender added a 20% tip to the author's own payment, that's not standard. Usually, tips are added to the bartender's earnings, not the customer's total. So maybe the author is misunderstanding how tipping works here. If the bartender was adding a tip to the customer's payment, that's odd. But more likely, the tip was meant to go to the bartender, and the author removed it. In that case, the author's action is against the norm, hence AITA.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the bartender added a tip without the customer's consent, the author's refusal to tip in response is a justified reaction. However, the author could have just not added a tip and not confronted the bartender. By directly telling the bartender not to take advantage, the author might have acted unprofessionally. The bartender's response of refusing service could be an overreaction, but in some places, that's their right.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's action of not tipping might be within their rights, but the way they handled it (confronting the bartender) could be seen as rude. However, the bartender's initial action of adding a tip unilaterally was also inappropriate. The author's response, while possibly confrontational, stems from a valid concern about being taken advantage of. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong. But in terms of social norms, refusing to tip is generally frowned upon. So it's a bit of a toss-up.\n\nBut the key here is that the bartender added the tip without the author's knowledge. If the club had a policy of adding tips, the author should have known. But if the bartender did it on their own, then the author's response is justified. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
