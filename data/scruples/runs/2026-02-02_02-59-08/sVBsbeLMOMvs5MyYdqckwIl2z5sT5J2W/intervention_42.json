      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who didn't tip their bartender is at fault. The situation is that they went to a club, invited four friends to drinks, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing them. The author was drunk but noticed this and decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then threatened not to serve them if they didn't tip. The author claims they were willing to tip appropriately but were upset about the bartender adding the tip without asking.\n\nFirst, I need to consider standard tipping etiquette. In many places, especially in service industries like bars and restaurants, a tip is expected as part of the service. The amount typically ranges from 15-20%, though this can vary. However, the key point here is that the bartender added the tip without the customer's knowledge or consent. That's unusual and could be seen as unethical or deceptive. Most places require servers to disclose if a tip is being added automatically, or allow customers to adjust it. If the bartender did this without informing the customer, that's a problem.\n\nNext, the author was drunk but not so much that they couldn't understand the situation. They noticed the bartender adding the tip and decided to tip 0%. Their reasoning was that the bartender shouldn't take advantage of someone who's drunk. The author's response was to refuse the tip, which led to the bartender threatening to not serve them. The author's defense is that they were willing to tip but were upset about the automatic addition.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, refusing to tip could be seen as disrespectful to the service staff, who often rely on tips as part of their income. However, the bartender's action of adding a tip without disclosure might have been the root issue. If the tip was mandatory or if the bartender added it without the customer's knowledge, that's a breach of trust. The customer has a right to know how their money is being handled.\n\nHowever, even if the bartender made a mistake in adding the tip without asking, the customer's response of tipping 0% in retaliation might be seen as extreme. Instead of confronting the bartender at the time, the customer could have asked for the tip to be removed or discussed the issue after the fact. By tipping 0%, the customer is withholding a customary tip, which could be seen as punishing the employee for the bartender's mistake. But the employee might also be following company policy, or perhaps the bartender had the right to add a tip if it's standard there. \n\nAnother angle: in some places, tipping is not mandatory, and customers can choose how much to tip. If the service was poor, a lower tip is acceptable. However, in this case, the service wasn't necessarily poor; the issue was the automatic tip. The author felt wronged because they weren't consulted. But the bartender's response of refusing to serve them for not tipping is also problematic. Employees shouldn't be allowed to deny service based on tipping disputes, as that's not the customer's responsibility. The establishment might have a policy on minimum tips, but it's the management's role to enforce that, not an individual bartender's.\n\nSo, the author's main issue was the bartender adding a tip without consent. If that's the case, the author isn't at fault for being upset. However, the way they handled it\u2014tipping 0% and making a comment\u2014might be seen as a direct confrontation. If the bartender added the tip and it was against the establishment's policy, the author is justified in objecting. But if it's a standard practice, the author's response might be considered wrong because they should have tipped regardless. But since the bartender didn't inform them, the author's action could be seen as a reasonable response to not being informed. \n\nIn summary, the author's main fault is in the way they handled the situation, but the root cause might lie with the bartender's actions. If the author was in a place where tipping is expected, and the bartender added the tip as part of their process, the author might be in the wrong for refusing to tip. However, if the tip was added without disclosure and against the establishment's policy, the author might be in the right. Since the situation is ambiguous regarding local customs and policies, the answer might depend on those factors. But generally, the author's refusal to tip after the bartender's mistake could be seen as a justified reaction, making them not in the wrong. However, the act of tipping 0% in response to the bartender's error might still be considered inappropriate, as it affects the employee's income. So, the author might be partially at fault, but the bartender's actions were also wrong. The answer might be a bit of both, but the question asks whether the author is in the wrong. Given that, the answer could be A or B depending on perspective. But since the user already thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to consider the situation. I think the author is not in the wrong because the bartender's actions were the issue, and the author had the right to object. So answer B."
