      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. Let me go through the details step by step.\n\nThe situation: The person went to a club with friends and bought four drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing them. The author was drunk but could still notice. They then decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender refused to serve them anymore if they didn't tip. The author claims they wanted to tip an appropriate amount but were upset the bartender added the tip without asking.\n\nFirst, I need to consider standard tipping practices. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary, and servers often rely on tips as a significant part of their income. However, the key point here is that the bartender added the 20% tip without the customer's knowledge. Normally, when you pay with a card, you might have the option to add a tip, and sometimes the system might default to a percentage. But if the bartender did this manually without informing the customer, that's different. The customer might feel that the bartender is being unethical by adding the tip himself and then threatening not to serve them when the customer objects.\n\nThe author's actions: They responded by tipping 0%, which is against the usual norm, but they had a reason. They felt the bartender was taking advantage. The bartender then refused to serve them. The author's defense is that they wanted to tip but were upset by the bartender's action.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, if the bartender added the tip without asking, that's a problem. The author had the right to refuse that. However, the author's response was to tip 0%, which is a valid choice, but some might argue that even if the bartender added the tip without permission, the author could still choose to tip an appropriate amount. The threat from the bartender to not serve them is also concerning because employees shouldn't be able to deny service over a tip, but the author might have escalated the situation by refusing to tip at all.\n\nAnother angle: The author might have overreacted by not tipping at all instead of confronting the bartender privately or explaining their issue. However, the bartender's initial action of adding the tip without consent is problematic. The author's decision not to tip could be seen as a justified protest against the bartender's behavior. But in terms of social norms, not tipping at all is generally frowned upon, regardless of the situation. So the author might be seen as in the right for objecting to the unauthorized tip but in the wrong for not tipping anything.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The bartender's actions were inappropriate, which might mitigate the author's responsibility. However, refusing to tip entirely, even if the bartender's action was wrong, might still be seen as the author's fault because they didn't tip. It's a bit of a gray area. Some people might argue that the bartender's behavior was worse, but others might say the author should have communicated their issue differently, like asking to adjust the tip or not tipping the unauthorized amount but still leaving a small tip. Since the author didn't do that, they might be seen as in the wrong.\n"
