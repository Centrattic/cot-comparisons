      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for not tipping their bartender. They went to a club with friends, invited four people to four drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without permission. The person was drunk but not too much to notice. They responded by tipping 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them anymore if they didn't tip. The person was ready to tip an appropriate amount themselves but was upset about the 20% being added without consent. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms around tipping. In many places, especially in the service industry like bars and restaurants, tipping is expected. Bartenders rely on tips as part of their income. If the author was planning to tip, but the bartender added 20% without asking, that might be an issue. However, sometimes establishments include a service charge or tip automatically, which is common in some areas. The confusion might be whether the bartender had the authority to add the tip or if the author expected to tip themselves.\n\nThe author's reaction to tip 0% because the bartender added 20% could be seen as retaliatory. By removing the tip entirely, they're withholding payment that the bartender might have expected. The bartender's response of refusing to serve is a strong reaction, but it's also within their right to refuse service if they feel disrespected or if someone is being disruptive, even if the person is just not tipping as expected. However, the author's main issue seems to be the unauthorized addition of the tip, which could be a problem if the bartender was supposed to let the customer decide. \n\nOn the other hand, the author was drunk, which might have affected their judgment and response. But being drunk doesn't excuse poor behavior towards service staff. The key point is whether the bartender had the right to add the tip without the customer's knowledge. If the establishment's policy is to include a tip automatically, the author might have agreed to that when entering, so not tipping could be seen as not honoring the agreement. However, if the bartender added it on his own without the establishment's policy, that's a different matter. \n\nThe author's intent to tip an appropriate amount themselves but being upset about the unauthorized addition complicates things. If they were going to tip anyway, removing it entirely might be excessive. But if they felt the bartender was taking advantage by adding it without consent, they have a point. However, their response was to tip 0%, which is not appropriate in most service industries. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author is likely in the wrong because they refused to pay any tip in response to the bartender's action, which is not acceptable. The bartender's action might have been unprofessional, but the author's response was also unprofessional and disrespectful. Therefore, the answer would be A.\n"
