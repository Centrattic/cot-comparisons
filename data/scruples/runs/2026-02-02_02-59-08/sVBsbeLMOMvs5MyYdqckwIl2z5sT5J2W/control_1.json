      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who didn't tip the bartender is in the wrong. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, invited four people for four drinks, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing them. The person was drunk but noticed this, then tipped 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of people who are drunk. The bartender then refused to serve them unless they tipped.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around tipping. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is expected for services like bartending. The usual tip is around 15-20%, so the bartender adding 20% might seem standard. However, the key point here is that the bartender didn't inform the customer before adding the tip. Normally, when you pay with a card, the total includes the tip, but the customer should be aware of it. If the bartender added the tip without permission, that's where the conflict arises.\n\nThe person in the story was drunk but not too much to notice the bartender's action. They felt it was a manipulation tactic, hence tipping 0% as a countermeasure. The bartender responded by refusing service unless they tipped. Now, the question is whether the customer was wrong for not tipping in this scenario.\n\nFrom the customer's perspective, they might feel that the bartender overstepped by adding a tip without consent, especially in a situation where the customer was under the influence. They might see it as taking advantage of someone's vulnerability. However, tipping is often part of the service industry's compensation, so not tipping could be seen as withholding a necessary part of the bartender's income.\n\nBut the bartender's action of automatically adding a tip without informing the customer is questionable. If the establishment has a policy of adding tips, they should communicate that clearly. If the bartender did it on his own, without the customer's knowledge, that's a problem. The customer might have had a legitimate reason to be upset about being pressured into an extra charge without being aware of it first.\n\nIn many cases, tips are discretionary. If the bartender added it without consent, maybe the customer is justified in responding by not tipping. However, the customer's approach of tipping 0% in response could be seen as taking it too far. They might have had the option to dispute the added tip or talk to management, but instead, they chose to retaliate, leading to the bartender refusing service.\n\nSo, the key points are: the bartender added a tip without permission, the customer was drunk but aware, and the customer's response was to not tip. The bartender's refusal to serve might be within their right if they have rules about minimum tips, but the initial action of adding the tip without consent is problematic.\n\nI think the customer's issue was with the bartender's lack of communication. If the bartender had added the tip as part of the total but informed the customer beforehand, the customer could have adjusted or discussed it. But since the bartender did it unilaterally, the customer's frustration is understandable. However, not tipping in response, especially in an industry where tips are a significant part of income, might be seen as the customer overreacting. The appropriate action might have been to address the issue with management or at least leave a reasonable tip despite the bartender's mistake.\n\nSo, considering all that, the customer might be at fault for not tipping, but the bartender also acted inappropriately by adding the tip without consent. However, the question is whether the customer is in the wrong. The answer might hinge on whether the customer's response was justified. If the bartender's actions were wrong, the customer's retaliation could be seen as an overreaction. Therefore, the customer might be in the wrong for not tipping, even if the bartender made a mistake.\n"
