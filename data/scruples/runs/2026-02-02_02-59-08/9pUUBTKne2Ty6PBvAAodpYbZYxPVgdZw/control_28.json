I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author having a sexual relationship with a married man who is also in the closet about being gay. The author is considering exposing the cheating husband to his wife, which would also out him as gay, even though the man's family might not accept it.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the moral implications here. The author was initially in a one-night stand at a wedding, then continued the relationship multiple times. The key points are consent and privacy. The man was upfront about being in the closet and asked the author not to out him. The author agreed, so breaking that trust could be an issue. However, the man is cheating on his wife, which is a betrayal.\n\nThe author's dilemma is between protecting the man's privacy (and his family's potential reaction to his being gay) and informing the wife about the infidelity. The author also mentions that the husband might not be the only person he's cheated with, given his Grindr account. This complicates things because the wife has a right to know about the infidelity, but outing him could lead to other consequences.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for considering exposing the cheater? Well, the author was in a consensual relationship, albeit one that involved deception by the man. The author didn't know about the marriage initially and later discovered it. The man's deception is a problem, but the author's actions might be seen as entangled in that deception if they continue the relationship once they know the truth.\n\nHowever, the author's intention to inform the wife is about honesty. Cheating is a serious issue, and the wife has a right to know. But doing so would out the man, which he hasn't chosen to do yet. The author could be seen as violating the man's privacy, which he entrusted to the author. But on the other hand, the man's actions are wrong, and the author might feel obligated to the wife.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author acts on the side of the wife by informing her, that's a moral choice. However, it's also a breach of the man's privacy. The author's initial consent to not out him was part of the agreement, so breaking that could be seen as a betrayal. But the author is trying to do the right thing by the wife, who's being cheated on.\n\nIn terms of the WIBTA framework, people often consider the balance between the harm caused by not acting vs. acting. Here, the harm of outing the man vs. the harm of the wife remaining in a cheating relationship. It's a tough call, but the author isn't the one who cheated. The author was deceived after the fact.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? I think the answer is no, because they're trying to correct a wrong done by the man. However, they should consider if there's a way to inform the wife without outing him, but if that's impossible, then the moral obligation to the wife might outweigh the privacy of the cheater. The author's actions are in response to the man's deceit, so they aren't the one at fault.\n"
