I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a person who slept with a married man who's in the closet, and now they're considering exposing him to his wife, even though it would out him.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author had a relationship with the man, who is married and not out as gay. The author knew not to out him initially but later found out he's cheating on his wife. Now, they're conflicted between informing the wife (which would out him) and keeping quiet to protect his privacy.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to assess whether the author's actions, particularly considering telling the wife, are justified. \n\nEthically, there's a tension between the wife's right to know about the infidelity and the man's right to privacy regarding his sexuality. The author might believe they're helping the wife, but outing someone can have severe consequences, especially in a conservative family. The man might also be a victim of his own circumstances, trapped in a closeted marriage.\n\nLegal-wise, in many places, cheating isn't a legal matter, so the author isn't obligated to report it. Morally, it's a gray area. The author could be seen as respecting the man's initial confidence by not outing him, but also has a concern for the wife's welfare. However, the author's own actions in the relationship might contribute to the problem\u2014they engaged in a relationship with someone they knew was married after being asked to keep it secret. \n\nThe author's main dilemma is whether to prioritize the wife's right to know or the man's privacy. The fact that the man is closeted adds complexity. The author might feel they have a duty to the wife, but they also have a responsibility to protect someone's confidentiality. \n\nConsidering the potential harm: outing someone can lead to family rejection, emotional trauma, and other repercussions. Conversely, keeping silent might allow the wife to remain unaware of the cheating. But the author isn't the one who cheated; they're a participant. So, their obligation to report might not be as clear. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author has valid concerns for the wife, their decision to expose the cheating by outing the man could be seen as violating the man's privacy. The author might be in the wrong for planning to out him, given the potential harm, especially since the man isn't the one who asked the author to report the infidelity. The author's own actions in forming a relationship with a married man also play a role here. Therefore, the answer could be A.\n"
