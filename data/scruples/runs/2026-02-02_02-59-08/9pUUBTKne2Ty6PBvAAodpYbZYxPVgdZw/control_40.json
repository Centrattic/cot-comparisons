I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the scenario is in the wrong. The author is a 20-year-old man who had a sexual relationship with a 23-year-old man who is married and has kids. The man is in the closet, and the author is conflicted about whether to expose the cheating, which would out him.\n\nFirst, the author was involved in a sexual relationship with someone who is married. That's a key point. Even if the married man is cheating, the author's decision to engage in that relationship might be considered problematic. He knew the man was in a committed relationship, so he was part of the infidelity. \n\nThe author now wants to tell the wife, which would out the man. The dilemma is between the man's privacy and the wife's right to know. But the author's own actions contribute to the situation. He had multiple encounters, so he's not just a passive observer. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he's part of the cheating scenario. By sleeping with a married man, he's complicit. However, the married man's actions are also wrong. The author's intent to expose the cheating could be seen as a moral obligation, but it also involves outing someone. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author is part of the cheating, then he's at fault for participating. However, the scenario might also consider the married man's responsibility. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. \n\nConsidering the situation, the author's actions (engaging in the affair) are part of the problem. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he was involved in the cheating and then wants to take action that could harm the other party. But the married man is also wrong. However, the focus here is the author's actions. Since he participated in the affair, he's in the wrong, so the answer is A.\n"
