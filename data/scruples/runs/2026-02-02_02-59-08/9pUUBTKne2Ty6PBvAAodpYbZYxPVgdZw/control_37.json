I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about someone who had multiple affairs with a married man who's also gay and in the closet. The author is now considering exposing the cheating but doesn't want to out him.\n\nFirst, the author had a relationship with the man, knowing he was in a marriage but not knowing about his sexuality. They agreed to keep it a secret. Now, the author found out he's married and cheated on his wife. The dilemma is whether to expose the cheating (which would out him) or protect his identity.\n\nThe key points here: the author is a cheater themselves, as they had multiple affairs. The man they were with is also cheating on his wife. The author is now conflicted about whether to tell the wife, which would out him. The author's actions are part of a consensual affair, but they are now considering exposing the cheating. \n\nLegally, adultery isn't a crime in most places, so the author isn't breaking the law here. But morally, the author is in a tricky spot. They were complicit in the affair and now want to report it, which could help the wife. However, outing someone's sexuality without consent is a violation of privacy. The author might be in the wrong for participating in the affair in the first place, but when considering exposing the cheating, they have a responsibility to the wife. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong now. If the author chooses not to expose the cheating, they might be protecting the man's privacy but letting the wife be unaware. If they do expose it, they're helping the wife but outing him. The answer hinges on whether the moral obligation to the wife outweighs the obligation to respect the man's privacy. \n\nIn this case, the author might not be in the wrong for considering exposing the cheating because the wife has a right to know. However, the act of outing someone without consent is problematic. The author should find a way to inform the wife without disclosing the man's sexuality. But if that's impossible, the ethical choice is to protect the man's privacy. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong if they choose to out him, but if they find a way to inform the wife without outing him, they might be in the right. \n\nBut the original question is whether the author is in the wrong as per the situation described. The author is in a position where they are trying to do the right thing, so maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong). However, if the act of exposing the cheating requires outing him, then the author could be in the wrong for violating his privacy. The answer depends on the approach taken. Since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong in the situation described, and the author hasn't taken action yet, the answer might be B because they're trying to navigate the situation with moral considerations. However, participating in the affair is part of the problem. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong \"in the wrong,\" so the answer might be A because the author was complicit in the affair and now is considering exposing it in a way that could hurt the man. But I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The author is considering exposing the cheating, which would out the man. The author is also in an affair. The act of cheating is wrong, but the question is about the wrongness of the author now. If the author is in the wrong for having an affair, then yes. But the question is specifically about the current dilemma of exposing the cheater. If the author's decision to expose or not is the focus, then it's a moral choice. The answer might be B because they're trying to do the right thing, even if their actions are part of the problem. Alternatively, since the author is part of the cheating, they might be in the wrong for participating. But the question is whether the act of exposing is wrong. The answer is B, because the author isn't in the wrong for considering the exposure, as they might have a duty to the wife. However, if the exposure involves outing him, then they are in the wrong. But the answer depends on the method. Since the author hasn't acted yet, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) as they are seeking advice on a moral dilemma.\n"
