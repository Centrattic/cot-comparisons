I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the person had an affair with someone who is married and gay, and now they're considering exposing the cheater, which would out him. \n\nFirst, the author is asking if they'd be wrong (WIBTA) for exposing the cheater. Let's break down the key points. The author had a relationship with a married man, which is cheating. They knew he was gay but in the closet. They had multiple encounters, and now they found out he's married with kids. The author is conflicted between telling the wife (which would out him) or keeping quiet.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, part of their dilemma is whether they should expose the cheater. But first, their own actions: they had an affair. That's a problem. The author was aware that the man was in a committed marriage, so their own actions were unethical. They were part of the cheating, so they have some responsibility here.\n\nNow, considering if they're in the wrong for wanting to tell the wife. The author is trying to do the right thing by informing the wife, but it would out the man. However, the author was complicit in the cheating. So even if their intention is good, their own actions were wrong. Also, by having the affair, they contributed to the harm done to the wife and family.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer hinges on their actions. Since they were part of the cheating, they are at fault. They can't just expose the man without taking responsibility for their own role. So the answer is likely A, yes, they are in the wrong.\n"
