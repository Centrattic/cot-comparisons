I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this situation. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering exposing a cheater, which would out him as gay. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the author is in a situation where they had multiple affairs with a married man who is also in the closet. The man asked them to keep his sexuality secret. Now, the author is conflicted about whether to tell the wife about the cheating, which would out him. \n\nOn one hand, the author is concerned about not outing someone, which is a valid point. Privacy and respecting someone's readiness to come out is important. On the other hand, the wife has a right to know that her spouse is cheating. The author feels obligated to inform the wife but is worried about the consequences of outing the husband.\n\nLet me consider the ethics here. Cheating is a betrayal of trust, and the wife deserves to know her husband's infidelity. However, the method of revealing this information is tricky because it's tied to his sexual orientation. Outing someone without their consent can be harmful, especially if the person is in the closet. The author might be caught between protecting someone's privacy and the wife's right to know.\n\nIs there a way to inform the wife without outing the husband? Maybe, but the author might not have enough information to do that. If the husband's infidelity is tied to him being gay and using Grindr, then revealing the cheating might inherently involve outing him. The author is in a tough spot because they care about both the husband's privacy and the wife's rights.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? If they decide to tell the wife, they might be right in doing so because the wife has been cheated on. However, outing someone can have severe consequences, including family strife and personal trauma. The author's intention is to do the right thing, but the method could be problematic. \n\nAlternatively, if the author chooses not to tell the wife, they might be enabling the cheating. But they might also be respecting the husband's privacy. The author's dilemma is real. However, the husband's actions (cheating) are wrong, and the wife has a right to know. The author isn't the one cheating; they're a third party. So, while the situation is complex, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to inform the wife, even if it out the husband. But they need to consider the ethical implications carefully.\n\nIn terms of the options given, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they're trying to address a betrayal by someone else. However, the method should be as non-harmful as possible. But according to the question, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering this action. Since the author is conflicted and trying to do the right thing, they aren't in the wrong. The decision is hard, but the intention is to right a wrong done by the husband.\n"
