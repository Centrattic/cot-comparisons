I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person in question had a sexual relationship with someone who's married and out of the closet. The key points here are consent, secrecy, and the potential consequences of exposing the cheater.\n\nFirst, the author and the married man had a consensual relationship, and he asked the author to keep his sexual orientation secret. The author agreed, understanding the sensitivity around coming out. Now, the author wants to expose the cheating but without outing him. The dilemma is whether they're morally obligated to inform the wife, which would mean outing him, or if they should keep quiet to respect his privacy.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, cheating is a personal matter, and the author isn't legally required to report it. However, morally, the situation is more complex. The author is considering exposing the man's infidelity, which could harm the wife but also breach the man's confidentiality. If the author doesn't tell the wife, the wife remains unaware of the betrayal. If they do tell her, they're not only informing her about the cheating but also revealing his sexuality without his consent, which he specifically asked to keep private.\n\nThe author's initial agreement to secrecy was part of the relationship's terms. By breaking that trust, even for a morally motivated reason, the author might be violating the man's privacy. The author's own experience of being cheated on doesn't necessarily obligate them to act as a third-party enforcer of moral standards. The man, however, is the one who broke the marital vows, not the author. The author's role here is to decide whether to honor the secrecy they agreed to or to breach it for what they see as a higher moral duty.\n\nThere's also the question of whether the author has a right to interfere. The man's decision to stay in the closet and the potential family repercussions are his to manage. The author's intervention could cause significant harm to the man's family relationships, which he might not be prepared for. The author might not have the full context of the man's situation either, such as why he's staying in the marriage despite cheating.\n\nIn terms of moral wrongs, the author's actions could be viewed as a breach of confidentiality. The man trusted the author to keep his secret, and the author's decision to expose him, even with good intentions, could be seen as violating that trust. The author is in a position where they had the choice to report or not, and by choosing to expose, they're taking a side in the man's personal and family matters, which might not be their place.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author might be in the wrong by breaking the confidentiality they agreed to, even if their intentions are to help the wife. The decision to out someone without their consent can have serious consequences, and the author's role here isn't clear-cut. Therefore, the answer is that the author is in the wrong.\n"
