I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering exposing a cheater, which would out him as gay. The author had an affair with a married man who is in the closet. The man is cheating on his wife, and the author is conflicted about whether to tell the wife, knowing it would out him.\n\nFirst, the author had consensual relationships with someone who was married without knowing his marital status. That's a key point. The man lied about being married, so he's the one who's being deceptive. The author might feel guilty because they didn't know initially, but once they found out, they were in a situation where they had to decide what to do.\n\nThe author is considering informing the wife, which would out the man. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for that. On one hand, the wife has a right to know about the infidelity. On the other hand, outing the man could cause family issues, especially with his parents who might not accept his sexuality.\n\nBut the man is the one who's cheating and being deceptive. The author isn't the one who's wrong here; the wrong is the man's for lying and cheating. The author is trying to do the right thing by informing the wife, even if it means outing him. The author isn't obligated to protect the cheater's secrets, especially since the man himself asked not to be outed but then proceeded to cheat. The author's dilemma is between two hard choices, but the initial wrong is the man's actions. So the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to expose the cheating, even if it out him. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
