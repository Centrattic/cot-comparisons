I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by breaking down the situation. The author is in a situation where they had a sexual relationship with a man who is married and in the closet. The man asked them not to out him, and the author respected his wishes initially. Now, the author has found out that the man is married with kids and is cheating on his wife. The dilemma is whether to tell the wife (thereby outing him) or not. The author is considering exposing the cheating, which would mean outing him, but is conflicted because they don't want to cause family issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author had consensual relationships, but the man was married and cheating. The author didn't know about the marriage when they started the affair. The man is also in the closet, so coming out could have serious consequences for him. The author is now faced with the decision to inform the wife, which would mean outing him, or staying silent.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong if they decide to expose the cheater. Let's look at both sides. On one hand, the author might be protecting the wife by informing her of the infidelity. The wife has a right to know her husband is cheating. On the other hand, outing someone's sexual orientation without their consent is generally seen as violating their privacy. The author is considering doing this despite the man's request for confidentiality.\n\nBut wait, the man is cheating. So there's a betrayal here. The author's actions in sleeping with a married man are also morally questionable. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong if they expose the cheater. The author is in a position where they might be complicit if they don't act, but also could be causing harm to the man by outing him. \n\nThe man is the one who is in the wrong for cheating and lying about his sexuality. The author's responsibility here is complex. They have a duty of care to the wife, perhaps, but also a respect for the man's privacy. However, the man's actions are deceitful, and the author is now part of the situation they helped create. \n\nIf the author decides to tell the wife, does that make them in the wrong? Or is it a moral obligation to prevent the wife from being cheated on? The man's privacy is important, but so is the wife's right to know about the infidelity. \n\nBut the author is also part of the problem. They engaged in a relationship with a married man, which is a personal choice that contributed to the situation. However, the author's intention to expose the cheating might be justified as a way to stop the harm. \n\nSo, the author's decision to expose the cheater would involve breaking the man's trust, but could be seen as a necessary action to correct his wrongdoings. Whether the author is in the wrong depends on balancing the harm of the infidelity against the harm of outing someone. In some ethical frameworks, the duty to prevent harm to others (the wife) might outweigh the duty to protect the man's privacy. \n\nBut the author is also in a tricky position because they were part of the affair. Their actions in sleeping with him could be considered complicit in the cheating. However, they didn't know he was married initially. The key point is whether the author is morally obligated to act here. \n\nIn terms of the question, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for exposing the cheater, which would involve outing him. If the author chooses to do so, is that the wrong decision? The answer could be that the author is in the right because they are protecting the wife from being cheated on, but the act of outing someone is a separate issue. However, outing someone without their consent is generally considered wrong, even if the motivation is to stop the cheating. \n\nAlternatively, the author might be in the wrong for violating the man's confidentiality, even if the intent is good. So, the moral dilemma here is between two wrongs: allowing the wife to be cheated on versus outing someone. Depending on the ethical perspective, the answer could vary. \n\nBut in terms of the original question, the user says they think the author is in the wrong. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). If the author decides to expose the cheater and out him, then they might be in the wrong for violating his privacy, despite the good intentions. However, if the primary harm is the cheating and the author is trying to stop that, maybe they are not in the wrong. \n\nIt's a bit of a tough call. The man is the one who is committing the wrong by cheating and being in the closet. The author is in a position where they can report the cheating but doing so would out him. The act of outing someone is generally considered harmful unless the person consents. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for violating the man's privacy, even if the intent is to help the wife. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they are breaching the man's confidentiality by outing him, which is a serious ethical violation, regardless of the reason. Alternatively, if the priority is the wife's right to know about the infidelity, then the answer might be B (No). But given the emphasis on not outing someone against their wishes, perhaps A is the correct answer here.\n"
