I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering exposing a cheater, which would out him. The situation involves a man who is married, had an affair with the author, and is gay but closeted. The author is conflicted about whether to tell the wife, which would out her husband.\n\nFirst, the author had an affair with the husband while knowing he was married. That's a violation of trust and likely a legal and moral issue. So, the author's actions here are questionable. But the main question is about exposing him, which would out his sexuality. \n\nThe husband is in the closet, and his family is not accepting. The author is considering telling the wife, which would out him. The dilemma is between the wife's right to know about the infidelity and the husband's privacy about his sexuality. \n\nLegally, cheating is not a crime, but the author has a moral obligation? The author might feel responsible because they had a relationship. But they also promised not to out him initially. However, the husband is the one who cheated, and the author's role here is complicated. \n\nIf the author tells the wife, it comes with outing him. Is that justified? It depends on the consequences. Outing someone can have severe repercussions, especially in a non-accepting family. On the other hand, the wife has the right to know about the infidelity. But the author isn't the best person to decide that. The husband's actions are wrong, but the author's potential exposure of both the cheating and his sexuality is another layer. \n\nThe author's initial decision to have an affair was wrong, and now they're complicit in the cheating. Telling the wife might be seen as a form of justice, but it's also using the husband's secret against him. The author might be trying to atone for their own part in the affair by taking action. \n\nBut the author's main mistake was getting involved in the affair in the first place. Their current dilemma is a consequence of their actions. So, while the author might not be wrong for wanting to inform the wife, their initial actions were wrong. However, the question is specifically about whether they're in the wrong for considering exposing the cheater, which involves outing him. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author isn't obligated to inform the wife. The wife's right to know is there, but the author isn't a third party in that marriage. It's not their role to expose the husband's infidelity. The author could be overstepping by making that decision. Additionally, outing someone is a serious act, and the author might not have the right to do that, especially without the husband's consent. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the author's main mistake was the affair. However, the act of potentially outing the husband to tell the wife is another issue. The author might not be in the wrong for feeling conflicted, but their decision to act on it could be problematic. The answer isn't straightforward, but the initial action (affair) was wrong, and the follow-up action (exposing) complicates things further. The best answer here would be that the author is in the wrong for the affair and also for considering the exposure without a clear justification.\n"
