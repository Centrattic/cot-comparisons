I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's unpack this. The person in the situation is considering exposing a cheater, which would involve outing him as gay. They had a sexual relationship with someone who later turned out to be married, and they found out he's using Grindr. Now they're conflicted between protecting his privacy (and his family's reaction to him being gay) versus the wife's right to know about the infidelity.\n\nFirst, the author is questioning whether they would be in the wrong (WIBTA) if they expose the cheater. The key points here are: the man is gay but closeted, the author had consensual relationships without knowing he was married, and now they want to inform the wife but are worried about outing him.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? The main ethical dilemma is between the wife's right to know about the cheating and the man's right to privacy regarding his sexuality. The author didn't know the man was married when they started the relationship, so they weren't intentionally cheating. However, they continued the relationship after learning he was married, which could be problematic. \n\nBut here's the catch: the author isn't the one who cheated; they were the other person in an affair. The married man is the one who broke the commitment to his wife. The author's role is more about deciding whether to inform the wife, which could out him. Legally, the author might not be obligated to tell the wife, but ethically, there's a debate. Some might argue the wife deserves to know, as she's being cheated on. Others might say the author shouldn't meddle and should respect the man's privacy, especially since outing him could have severe personal consequences.\n\nIn terms of the question, the user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. If they decide to tell the wife, they might be doing the right thing for the wife but wrong by outing someone. If they don't tell, they might be protecting the man's privacy but letting the wife stay unaware. The answer hinges on whether the author is the one at fault here. Since the married man is the cheater, the author isn't the one in the wrong. Their dilemma is about balancing two ethical considerations. So the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong), as the wrong here is the man's infidelity, not the author's decision-making process.\n"
