I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering exposing a cheater, which would out him as gay. The situation is complex.\n\nFirst, the author had a series of affairs with a married man who's in the closet. The man is cheating on his wife, and the author now wants to tell the wife but is conflicted because it would out him. The key points here are the ethics of whistleblowing versus privacy.\n\nThe author is in a dilemma: the husband is cheating, which is wrong, but outing him as gay could cause family issues. The author might feel obligated to tell the wife because she's being cheated on. However, the author also made a promise of confidentiality initially. Breaking that trust could have consequences, but so could letting the wife remain unaware of the infidelity.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author was complicit in the affair, which is cheating. But the question is about whether exposing the cheater now makes them wrong. The author's intentions matter here. If they're trying to do the right thing by informing the wife, but it leads to outing him, there's a conflict between two wrongs. However, the author didn't know about the marriage initially, so their initial actions weren't malicious. Now, they're trying to correct a mistake.\n\nThe dilemma is between the wife's right to know and the man's right to privacy regarding his sexuality. There's no clear answer, but ethically, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to inform the wife. However, the act of outing someone, even a cheater, can be problematic. Maybe there's a way to inform the wife without outing him, like through a third party or anonymously. But the author might not have that option.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the author's decision to expose the cheater isn't inherently wrong, but they should consider the consequences and try to minimize harm. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer might be B (No) because they're trying to do the right thing by the wife, even if it's a tough situation. However, the initial affair was wrong, but the current dilemma is about the exposure. So the answer might be B.\n"
