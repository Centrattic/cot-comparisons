I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is a 20-year-old guy who had a sexual relationship with a married man, who is also his best friend's sister's husband. The man is in the closet about being gay and asked the author not to reveal anything. The author now knows that the man is cheating on his wife and is considering exposing him to the wife, which would out him. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the author had a consensual relationship with the man, but the man was married and in the closet. The author agreed not to out him initially, respecting his privacy. Now, the author is conflicted between protecting the man's secret and informing the wife about the infidelity.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the author didn't force the relationship; it was consensual. However, by having a relationship with a married man, even if he's hiding his sexuality, the author is complicit in the cheating. The man is the one who's wronged his wife, but the author is involved in the affair. \n\nIf the author decides to tell the wife, he's outting the man, which could have serious consequences for him, especially given the family's reaction. But the wife has a right to know she's been cheated on. However, the author isn't in a position to meddle in their marriage. The author's role here is to take responsibility for his own actions and perhaps end the relationship without interfering further. \n\nThe author might not have the right to expose the man's affair because it's between him and his wife. The author's involvement is personal, so stepping in as a third party could cause more harm. The author should consider their own part in the situation and perhaps not take it upon themselves to act as a moral authority. \n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong if they proceed to out the man, as it's not their place to interfere in the marriage. They should focus on their own accountability and stop the relationship, without escalating the situation.\n"
