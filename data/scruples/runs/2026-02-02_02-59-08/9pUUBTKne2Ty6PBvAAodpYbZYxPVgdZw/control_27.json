I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation they described. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the author is a 20-year-old male who had a sexual relationship with a 23-year-old male named \"this man\" who is married and a father. The man is in the closet, and the author promised not to out him. Now, the author discovered the man is married and has kids, which makes the relationship a cheating scenario. The author is conflicted between not outing the man (to protect his family) and informing the wife (which would out him).\n\nThe author's main dilemma is whether they're wrong (A) or not wrong (B) for considering exposing the cheater, even if it means outing him. \n\nLet me consider the ethical angles here. The author was in a consensual relationship with the man, who was deceptive about his marital status. The author didn't know he was married when they started the affair, so they weren't intentionally cheating. However, they were complicit in the man's deceit by not checking into his background before sleeping with him. That might be a point against the author, but it's not entirely their fault if the man lied.\n\nNow, the author is trying to decide whether to tell the wife. On one hand, the wife has a right to know about the infidelity. On the other, outing the man could cause family issues and emotional harm. The author is trying to balance these two. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for wanting to inform the wife? If they tell the wife, they might be doing the right thing ethically by preventing further harm to the wife. However, outing someone's sexuality without their consent is generally considered wrong, especially if it leads to family problems. The author made a promise not to out him, so breaking that could be a breach of trust. But the man broke his marriage vows, so there's a conflict between the two obligations.\n\nThe author's actions could be seen as trying to do the right thing by the wife, but the method (outing) might be questionable. Alternatively, the author might be overstepping by deciding to inform the wife without considering the man's wishes. However, the man is the one who cheated, so the author isn't the one at fault for the infidelity. \n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, the main issue is whether they should have kept the secret or informed the wife. The author's intentions are conflicted, but they are trying to resolve a moral dilemma. Since the man was deceptive, the author isn't entirely to blame for the affair. The real question is whether the author is wrong for wanting to expose the cheater, which is a separate issue from their own actions. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would likely be B (Not in the wrong) because the author is caught in a tough situation where they want to protect the man's privacy but also act in the wife's best interest. The author's actions are not malicious; they're trying to do the right thing despite the complexities. However, there's a possibility of A if the act of outing is considered too harmful, but the question is about the author being in the wrong for considering exposure. Since they're trying to inform the wife, which is ethically a gray area but not necessarily wrong, B seems more appropriate.\n"
