I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me read through the scenario again carefully.\n\nThe author is a 20-year-old male who had a sexual relationship with a male usher at their friend's sister's wedding. The usher, who is married with two kids, is in the closet and asked the author not to out him. They had multiple encounters after the wedding. The author found out the usher is married and cheating, possibly via Grindr. Now they're conflicted about whether to tell the wife, which would out him, or keep it secret.\n\nFirst, the author engaged in a sexual relationship with someone who was married. That's the core issue here. The usher is cheating on his wife, which is a betrayal. But the author also didn't know he was married initially. However, the author is considering exposing the usher's infidelity, which would reveal his sexuality to his wife and possibly others.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, let's break it down. The author had consensual relationships with the usher, but the usher was married and in the closet. The author didn't know about the marriage at first, but after finding out, continued the relationship. That's problematic because it's an ongoing affair. The author is now considering informing the wife, which would out the usher, but also expose the cheating.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, cheating is wrong, and the author is complicit in that affair. However, the author is also in a dilemma between protecting the usher's privacy and the wife's right to know. But the author's main issue is their own role in the affair. The question is whether they're in the wrong for wanting to expose the cheater. \n\nBut the original question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's actions led to the situation where they have to decide to expose someone else's cheating. The author is not the one who cheated; the usher did. However, the author is involved in the affair. So maybe they share some responsibility for continuing the relationship once they knew it was an affair. But the key here is the decision to expose the cheater. \n\nIf the author is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting to expose the cheater, the answer depends on the circumstances. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong in general. Since the author didn't cheat themselves\u2014they were involved with someone who cheated, but the author isn't married here. The author's actions might be considered unethical for continuing the affair once they knew it was cheating. But the main question is about the exposure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author is not in the wrong because they're trying to do the right thing by informing the wife, even though it means outing the husband. But the author is part of an affair, which is their own wrongdoing. So maybe both aspects are at play. However, the original question is about whether the author is in the wrong in the situation. \n\nGiven that the author is part of an extramarital affair, that's their own wrongdoing. However, the question is about whether they're in the wrong for considering exposing the cheater. The answer hinges on whether the exposure is justified. But the initial question is about the author being in the wrong in general. So the author's participation in the affair is their wrongdoing, but the act of exposing might be a separate issue. \n\nSo the answer would be A, yes, the author is in the wrong for being involved in an extramarital affair. Even if they're now trying to do the right thing by exposing the cheater, their own participation is unethical. Therefore, they are in the wrong.\n"
