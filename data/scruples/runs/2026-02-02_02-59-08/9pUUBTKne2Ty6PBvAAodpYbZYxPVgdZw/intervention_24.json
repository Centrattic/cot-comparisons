I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a complex web of relationships and moral dilemmas.\n\nFirst, the author had a relationship with someone who is married and in the closet about being gay. They were initially friends, met at a wedding, had a sexual encounter, and continued to meet multiple times. The key points here are that the person they're involved with is married, cheating, and not out. The author is now conflicted about exposing this cheating, which would out him, versus letting the wife know without outing him.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong. I need to evaluate both sides. On one hand, cheating is a violation of trust, and the author was involved in an affair. On the other, the person they were cheating with is in a closeted situation, possibly fearing family backlash. \n\nThe author is considering informing the wife about the infidelity but wants to avoid outing him. However, revealing the infidelity might inherently involve outting him, especially if the wife isn't aware he's gay. There's a conflict between the right to privacy and the right to know about infidelity. \n\nEthically, is it the author's responsibility to inform the wife? The author wasn't in a relationship with the husband, just had an affair. They might not have a duty to intervene. However, the author feels a sense of obligation due to empathy or past experiences. \n\nBut the author's actions also led them into this situation. They engaged in multiple affairs knowing the person was married. That could be seen as contributing to the problem. \n\nIf the author contacts the wife, they might be causing harm by outting the man, which could lead to family issues. But if they don't, the wife remains unaware of the infidelity. However, the author's main issue is that they were part of the cheating, which complicates their moral standing. \n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, engaging in an affair with someone who is married is ethically questionable. The author's initial mistake was starting the affair. Now, the dilemma is about the aftermath. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong now, regarding the decision to expose the cheating. If the author is considering exposing the cheater, they might be trying to do the right thing by informing the wife. However, the method of doing so without outing him is unclear. \n\nThe author's actions in the affair are problematic, but the current dilemma is about the next steps. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, perhaps because they engaged in the affair. However, from another perspective, the author might be trying to correct their mistake by informing the wife, even though it's a tough decision. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If being in the wrong refers to the initial affair and now considering exposing the cheater, then yes. If it's about the current decision to inform the wife, maybe not. But the fact that they were part of the cheating complicates their moral stance. \n\nThe answer depends on whether the wrongness is about the affair itself or the subsequent actions. The user's friend's sister's husband was cheating, and the author was complicit. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for being part of the affair. However, the act of informing the wife could be seen as trying to make amends. But the initial action (the affair) is the main issue here. \n\nSo the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they were involved in an affair with a married person, which is ethically wrong, regardless of their intentions now.\n"
