I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the scenario is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the author (a 20-year-old male) had a sexual relationship with a 23-year-old male who was a married man and a father. They met at a wedding where the author got drunk and slept with the usher. The usher later came out as gay but closeted. They continued their relationship multiple times after that. The author discovered the usher was married and felt guilty, leading to the dilemma of whether to expose him to his wife or keep it secret to protect his privacy.\n\nSo, the key points here: the author was in a sexual relationship with a married man, which is cheating. The author is now considering exposing the cheater, but doing so would out him as gay. The author's main conflict is between the husband's privacy and the wife's right to know about the infidelity.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he was involved in a consensual affair, but he's now trying to resolve the moral issue by potentially exposing the man. However, the author's actions led to the situation where he's now considering outing someone. The original wrong here is the affair itself. The author might be complicit in the cheating. But is he in the wrong for considering exposing the cheater? \n\nIf the author reveals the marriage fraud to the wife, he's breaching confidentiality, which could be seen as wrong because he promised not to tell anyone. However, the husband is cheating, which is inherently wrong. The author's dilemma is between two moral wrongs: keeping the secret and allowing the wife to be cheated on, or exposing the husband and causing him to be outed, which might have negative repercussions.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's actions (the affair) were unethical. However, the current situation is about whether he's in the wrong for exposing the cheater. The answer depends on whether the author has a moral obligation to the wife. If the author believes the wife has a right to know, then perhaps he's not in the wrong for acting on that belief. However, he did make a promise to the husband not to reveal anything, so breaking that could be seen as wrong. But the husband was deceptive, which complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, the author might be in the wrong for engaging in the affair in the first place, which set the whole thing in motion. But the question is specifically about the current dilemma of exposing the cheater. So, the answer could be B (not in the wrong) if the action is justified in revealing the infidelity, even if it out the husband. However, if the author is breaching confidentiality without a clear right to do so, then he might be in the wrong. It's a tough call. But given the context of cheating, the author might feel the wife's right to know is more important, so B could be the answer.\n"
