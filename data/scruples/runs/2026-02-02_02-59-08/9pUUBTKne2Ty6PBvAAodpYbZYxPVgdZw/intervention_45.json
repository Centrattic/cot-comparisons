I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they had a sexual relationship with a married man who's in the closet. He's married, has kids, and the author found out he's cheating. The author is now considering exposing him to his wife but doesn't want to out him to his family, who might not accept his sexuality.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author had a relationship with someone who was married, which is cheating. That's a big issue. But the man is also gay and closeted, so there's a layer of personal struggle there. The author promised not to out him initially, which they respected. Now, the author is conflicted about whether to tell the wife he's cheating, which would also out him.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for having the affair in the first place? That's a moral question. Cheating is generally considered wrong, but maybe the man was the one who initiated it by being unfaithful. The author might be more of a victim here, but they did engage in the relationship. However, they were aware he was married, so that's a problem.\n\nThen, the author is considering exposing the man to his wife. On one hand, the wife has a right to know about the infidelity. On the other hand, outing him could have serious consequences for him and his family. The author is trying to balance these two issues.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author is considering exposing the cheater, maybe that's a moral obligation, or maybe it's overstepping. But since the author was part of the affair, do they have the right to expose him? Or is it none of their business? \n\nAlso, the author might be conflicted because they care about the man and his family's well-being. So, there's a mix of emotions here. The key points are: the affair, the man's marital status, his being closeted, and the potential exposure.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author is in a tough spot. They were part of the affair, which is wrong, but now they're trying to do the right thing by potentially exposing the cheater. However, exposing him would also out him, which could be harmful. The author might be trying to balance between the wife's right to know and the man's privacy.\n\nSo, the main factors are the initial affair (wrong) and the decision to expose him (possibly right or wrong). The question is whether the author is in the wrong overall. Since they were part of the cheating, that's a mistake. But their intention now to inform the wife could be seen as trying to make amends. However, the act of informing the wife might also be problematic, as it's a breach of privacy and could cause family issues.\n\nIn some perspectives, the author is in the wrong for being involved in the affair. But in terms of the current dilemma, are they in the wrong for wanting to expose him? It's a gray area. If the author is trying to do the right thing by informing the wife, maybe they're not in the wrong. However, if the author's actions could harm the man's life, that's a different matter.\n\nAlternatively, the author might not be in the wrong because they're trying to set things right after being part of the problem. But the initial affair was a mistake. The question is whether the author is in the wrong now, given their current intentions.\n\nSo, the answer might be A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because they were part of the cheating, but the current situation's complexity might make it not so clear. However, the initial action of engaging in the affair is a moral wrong. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
