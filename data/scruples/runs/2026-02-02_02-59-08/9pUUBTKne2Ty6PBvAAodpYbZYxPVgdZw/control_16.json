I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the WIBTA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author had an affair with a married man who is gay and closeted. The man asked the author to keep it a secret because he's not ready to come out. Now the author is conflicted between telling the wife about the cheating and outing him or keeping quiet.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The author was in a relationship with someone who's married, which is cheating. But the man is also in a harmful situation due to societal pressures regarding his sexuality. The author is now trying to decide whether to expose the cheating, which would out him as gay, or stay silent.\n\nFrom a deontological perspective, the author might have a duty to tell the truth to the wife because the husband has wronged her. But there's also a duty to respect the man's autonomy regarding his coming out. On the other hand, consequentialism would look at the outcomes: if telling the truth causes more harm (like family issues or the man's personal distress) than it helps (the wife knowing she's been cheated on), maybe it's not the right move. \n\nBut the author is also complicit here. They had multiple affairs knowing he was married. So, maybe the author is in the wrong for being part of the cheating in the first place. However, the question is whether they're still in the wrong for trying to expose him now. \n\nThe key points are: the author didn't know he was married at first, they had a consensual affair (though it's still cheating), and now they want to do the right thing by the wife but at the cost of outing him. \n\nThe author is in a sticky situation. But are they in the wrong? Well, they made a choice to have an affair, which is unethical. However, their current dilemma is about correcting a wrong done to the wife. But the act of exposing the cheating would also violate the man's privacy. \n\nIf the author is trying to do the right thing by informing the wife, that might not make them wrong, even if it out him. However, the fact that they were part of the infidelity complicates things. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong now, in the exposure decision. \n\nI think the answer is that the author isn't in the wrong for trying to inform the wife, even if it leads to outing him. However, they might be in the wrong for engaging in the affair initially. But the main question is about the exposure part. The dilemma is between two wrongs. The author's intent is to right a wrong done to the wife, even though it has other consequences. So their action might be justified, making them not in the wrong. But maybe there's a more ethical way, like consulting a trusted person to mediate. \n\nBut according to the question, the options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no). Considering the author's intent is to inform the wife, which is a valid concern, and their own role in the affair is part of the problem but not the current decision. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
