I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author sleeping with a married man who's in the closet about being gay. The key points here are the initial consent to keep the affair secret, the discovery that the man is married and cheating, and the dilemma about exposing him to his wife.\n\nFirst, the author had an affair with someone who was already married. That's a problem because it's infidelity. The man was in the closet, so the author had agreed not to out him. But then the author found out he's cheating on his wife. Now, the author is considering telling the wife to expose the cheating but also outing him as gay in the process.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's actions started with engaging in a relationship with a married man, which is ethically questionable. Then, after the fact, they're trying to decide whether to inform the wife. The dilemma is between protecting the man's privacy and the wife's right to know about the infidelity.\n\nIf the author tells the wife, they might be preventing harm to the wife by revealing the cheating, which could be justified. But outing the man without his consent, even if it's to inform the wife, could be seen as violating his privacy. However, since the man is cheating, the author might not have the same obligation to keep it secret as they would if he were in a monogamous relationship. The man's actions (cheating) could also make the author's decision more complex. \n\nOn the other hand, the author was part of an affair, which is their own wrongdoing. They might feel guilty and want to correct their mistake by informing the wife. But they also have to consider the consequences for the man's family and his parents' potential reaction. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the answer hinges on whether they should have told the wife, but their initial action of cheating is also a factor. However, the main issue here is the decision to expose the man's cheating, which could be seen as a moral obligation to the wife, even if it out him. The author is conflicted between two wrongs: protecting someone's privacy or preventing harm to another person. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the author's decision to tell the wife might be justified as a way to prevent ongoing harm to the wife, but their own participation in the affair is a separate issue. However, the question is specifically about whether the author is in the wrong in the situation presented. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but others might argue they're trying to right a wrong. But the initial affair is a problem. However, the main action in question is the potential exposure. \n\nIf the author decides to tell the wife, they might be acting in the wife's best interest, even if it out the man. However, the author's role in the affair is part of the scenario. The answer might be that the author is not in the wrong for wanting to inform the wife, as it's about protecting someone from betrayal, despite the collateral damage. But if the author's main fault is their own infidelity, that's separate. But the question is about whether they're in the wrong in the situation of exposing. \n\nHmm. The user says they think the author is in the wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). The key here is whether the author's intent to expose the cheating, despite outing, makes them wrong. If the author is trying to prevent harm to the wife, maybe they're not in the wrong. But if the author's actions caused harm to the man, that's another angle. \n\nThe answer might be B (no), because the author is trying to inform the wife of a betrayal, which is a moral duty. Even though it out the man, the main issue is the cheating. The author's own actions (cheating) are a separate matter but the question is about the current decision. So the answer could be B. But some might argue that the author is complicit in the man's infidelity and shouldn't meddle. It's a tough call.\n"
