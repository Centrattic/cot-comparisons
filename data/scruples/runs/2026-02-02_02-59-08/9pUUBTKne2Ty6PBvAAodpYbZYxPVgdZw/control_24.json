I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA scenario is in the wrong. Let me go through the details carefully.\n\nFirst, the author, who's 20M, had a sexual relationship with a man (23M) who was married and a father. The man was closeted and asked the author not to reveal his sexuality. They met at a wedding, and the author didn't know about his marriage until later. Now the author is conflicted about whether to tell the wife about the cheating, which would out him, or stay silent.\n\nSo, the key points here: the author didn't know the man was married when they started the affair. The man is cheating on his wife, which is a betrayal. The author is considering exposing the cheating but that would out the man's sexuality. The author is also aware that the man's family isn't accepting, so outing him could cause family issues.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. The author didn't know about the marriage when they had the affair. So they weren't intentionally cheating with someone who was married. They were in a situation where the man was hiding his marriage and his sexuality. The author is now trying to do the right thing by informing the wife, even though it might out him. \n\nBut wait, the author was in a consensual relationship with the man. However, the man was married and had a family. The author's actions contributed to the cheating. But the author didn't know. So maybe they're not to blame for the affair itself. The bigger question is whether they should expose the husband, which would out him but protect the wife. \n\nMoral dilemmas here: the right to privacy versus the wife's right to know. The author is in a tough spot. If they tell the wife, they out the husband, which the husband didn't want to happen. If they don't, the wife continues to be cheated on. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? They didn't know the man was married when they started the affair, so they might not be at fault for the affair itself. However, the fact that they had a relationship with a married man, even if they didn't know initially, could be seen as contributing to the cheating. But since they were unaware, that's a mitigating factor. \n\nThe author's intention to inform the wife is a moral choice. But outing someone's sexuality without their consent is a serious issue. However, in this case, the act of informing the wife would also reveal the husband's infidelity and his sexuality. So, the author is caught between two ethical issues. \n\nIn terms of being \"in the wrong,\" the author's actions up to this point (the affair) might not be their fault because they were deceived. The current dilemma is whether to act on the information they now have. The question is whether the author is wrong for wanting to expose the cheater, which would out him. \n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether the author is responsible for the initial affair. Since they didn't know the man was married, they might not be at fault. However, if they had the opportunity to verify his marital status and didn't, that's different. But in the scenario, they met at a wedding where the wife was out of the country, so the author might not have had reason to suspect. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for the affair, but the decision to expose the cheater is a moral choice. The question is whether the author is in the wrong now. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The initial actions led to the affair, but since they were unaware of the marriage, maybe they're not at fault. The current dilemma is about their next step. The question is whether the author is in the wrong, implying their current situation. The answer would likely be B (no), as they're trying to do the right thing despite the complexity.\n"
