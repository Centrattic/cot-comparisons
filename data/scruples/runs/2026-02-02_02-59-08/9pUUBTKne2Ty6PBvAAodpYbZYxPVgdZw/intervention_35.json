I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a couple of key points. First, the author had a sexual relationship with someone they met at a wedding. The person was a married man with two kids, and he's gay but in the closet. He asked the author not to tell anyone. Now the author is conflicted about whether to expose him to his wife, which would out him, even though they think he might be cheating on her.\n\nSo, the main ethical question here is whether the author has a responsibility to inform the wife about the infidelity, even if it means outing the man. On one side, cheating is a betrayal, and the wife has a right to know. On the other, outing someone without their consent is a big deal, especially if the person is in the closet and their family might not accept it. The author also mentions they care for the man and don't want to cause family issues.\n\nNow, considering the author's actions: they had a relationship with a married man who was dishonest about his marital status. They were aware he was in the closet and promised not to out him. Then they found out he's married and cheated. The author is now considering breaking that promise to inform the wife. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If they choose to tell the wife, they're violating the man's privacy and potentially causing harm. But if they don't, the wife remains unaware of her husband's infidelity. The author's initial relationship was consensual, but the problem arises when they decide to expose him. The author's dilemma is between two wrongs: breaking a promise to out someone versus allowing a spouse to be cheated on. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the wife has a right to know, but the author isn't legally obligated to inform her. Ethically, it's a tough call. The author might be in the wrong for having the affair in the first place, but the question is about exposing the cheater. If the author didn't know he was married, they might have a different responsibility. However, since they found out, they have to consider the consequences of their actions. \n\nThe author's main conflict is between loyalty to the man's privacy and the wife's right to know. The answer might depend on cultural and personal values. If the author is in the wrong, it's for breaking the promise to the man. If not, it's because they're trying to correct a wrong by informing the wife. However, since the author was complicit in the cheating, their position is compromised. I think the author is in the wrong because they made a promise to keep the man's secret, and going back on that could cause significant harm without clear justification. So the answer is A.\n"
