I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for considering exposing a cheater, even if it out him as gay. So first, the situation: they had a sexual relationship with a man who was married and in the closet. He asked them not to tell anyone because he's gay and not ready to come out. Now they found out he's married with kids, so they feel they should tell his wife but are conflicted because it would out him.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to inform the wife. The key points are consent and privacy. The author had a sexual relationship with someone who was in a committed (marriage) and a family context. The man was cheating on his wife, which is a betrayal. The author, however, also knew he was in the closet and promised not to out him.\n\nNow, the author is considering telling the wife. But here's the catch: the author's relationship with the man was consensual. Unless they're in a committed relationship themselves, they might not have an obligation to the wife. However, the wife has a right to know she's been cheated on. But the author's role in this is complicated. \n\nThe author's actions (having the affair) might be seen as part of the problem. If they were in a committed relationship with the man, they'd have a duty to the wife. But since they were in a casual, non-committed arrangement, maybe their responsibility is less. However, they knew he was married and cheating, so they could be seen as complicit in the infidelity. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The main ethical issues are: 1) Did they break their promise to not out him? 2) Are they responsible for exposing the infidelity?\n\nIf the author tells the wife, they are outing him, which he asked them not to do. That's a breach of trust. However, the wife has a right to know about the betrayal. The author is in a dilemma between two wrongs: breaking a promise to protect someone's privacy versus informing someone who's been wronged. \n\nIn many cases, people might argue that the wife's right to know is more important, but the author's initial agreement not to out him complicates things. The author might be in the wrong for starting the affair in the first place, knowing he was married. But the question is about exposing the cheater, which involves outing him. \n\nIf the author's actions (telling the wife) lead to outing him, they are violating his privacy. Depending on the cultural context, outing someone can have serious consequences, especially if the family is not accepting. So the author might be in the wrong for violating the promise. However, the wife's right to know is also a strong point. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer could be A (they are in the wrong) because they broke their promise to protect his privacy, or B (not in the wrong) because the wife deserves to know. However, the author's initial involvement in the affair might contribute to their being in the wrong. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author is in the wrong for having the affair with a married man and then considering to out him by informing the wife. Their initial actions led to the situation, and breaking the promise to not out him would be another wrong. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
