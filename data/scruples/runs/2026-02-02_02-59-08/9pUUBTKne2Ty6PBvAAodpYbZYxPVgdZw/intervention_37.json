I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author sleeping with a married man who's in the closet about being gay. The author is considering exposing the cheating but is worried about outing him. The user thinks the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author had a sexual relationship with someone they met at a wedding. The person was married, cheating, and not out as gay. The author is now conflicted between telling the wife (which would out him) or staying silent. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nThe author's actions start with sleeping with a married man. That's cheating on the man's part, not the author's. But the author is also part of the friend's family, so maybe there's a loyalty issue here. The author is now considering informing the wife. The dilemma is between the man's privacy and the wife's right to know.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the man is the one who cheated. The author is in a position where they have information that could affect others. However, the author isn't the one who initiated the affair; the man did. The author might feel guilty because they've developed feelings, but that's more about their own emotions than wrongdoing.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for wanting to tell the wife? If the author reveals the cheating, they have to out the man, which is a violation of his privacy. But the wife has a right to know she's being cheated on. However, the author isn't legally or morally obligated to inform the wife unless there's a duty of care, which isn't the case here. The author isn't the man's partner or family, so they're not responsible for the man's actions.\n\nOn the other hand, by having a relationship with a married person, the author could be seen as complicit. But the author didn't know he was married at first. Wait, no\u2014the author knew he was married after the first time? The scenario says the author found out a week ago that he's married. So they had multiple encounters after that. That's the key point. If the author knew he was married and continued the relationship, that's part of the problem. But the user says the author is in the wrong for exposing the cheater and outing him. Wait, the author is considering informing the wife, which would out him. So the author is the one who was in a relationship with the married man, which is part of the issue.\n\nSo the author's main mistake is getting involved in a relationship with someone they knew was married. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering to expose the cheater (i.e., inform the wife). The author's actions up to that point (sleeping with a married person) are part of their own wrongdoing. However, the question is specifically about whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to expose the cheater, which would involve outing him.\n\nThe author is in a difficult position because they're trying to balance the cheating against the man's privacy. The author's own actions (sleeping with a married person) don't directly make them wrong for considering informing the wife. However, the author's initial involvement is part of the problem. If the author is considering informing the wife, the ethics of that depend on whether the author has a right to intervene in someone else's relationship. Typically, people don't have a duty to inform third parties about cheating unless there's a direct obligation, like being a spouse or legal guardian. Since the author isn't the spouse, their intervention could be seen as overstepping. Additionally, outing the man would be a breach of his privacy, which he's not ready for. The author might be trying to do the right thing by protecting the wife, but they're not in a position to enforce that.\n\nSo, the author is in a morally ambiguous situation. Their own actions contributed to the problem, but the act of informing the wife is a separate issue. The author isn't in the wrong for considering it, but their own initial involvement is problematic. However, the question is specifically about whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to expose the cheater. The answer might hinge on whether the author's intent is to do the right thing despite the complications. The author is in a tough spot, but perhaps they aren't in the wrong for considering it. However, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me check again.\n\nThe user says the author is in the wrong. The user might be pointing out that by sleeping with the married man, the author is complicit and shouldn't take sides. But the act of informing the wife is a different matter. The author's initial actions are their own fault, but the decision to inform the wife is a separate ethical choice. So, the answer depends on whether the act of informing is wrong. If the author is not legally or morally required to inform the wife, then perhaps they aren't in the wrong for considering it, but it's a bad idea. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong, not whether the action is advisable. The author isn't in the wrong for considering it, but they might be in the wrong for their initial actions. However, the user is asking about the exposure part. The answer could be B (not in the wrong) because the author isn't obligated to stay silent, but the initial relationship is their own problem. However, some might argue that the author is in the wrong for getting involved in the first place, making their subsequent actions complicate the matter. But the question is specifically about the exposure part. So the answer could be A or B. Given the details, the author is not in the wrong for considering to inform the wife, even though their own actions were problematic. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
