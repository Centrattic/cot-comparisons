I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author, a 20-year-old male, had a sexual relationship with a man (a 23-year-old usher at his best friend's sister's wedding). The usher is married and has kids, and the author found out he's cheating on his wife. The usher is in the closet about being gay. The author is now conflicted: should he tell the wife about the infidelity, which would out the usher, or stay silent?\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The author had consensual sex with the usher, who was married. The usher didn't disclose his marital status. The author now wants to inform the wife but is worried about outing a gay person, which the usher is not ready for. The author is also concerned about family dynamics, as the usher's parents might react badly to his sexuality.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The main issue here is whether the author is justified in exposing the usher's infidelity, even if it leads to outing him. Let's consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the author was in a consensual relationship with the usher. The usher didn't tell the author he was married, so the author might not be entirely at fault. However, the author also didn't check the usher's marital status before engaging in a sexual relationship. But in some cases, people might not know someone's relationship status, especially if they're meeting through social events. \n\nOn the other hand, the author now wants to inform the wife. But revealing that the husband has been cheating (especially through a gay affair) would require the wife to know that her husband is gay. So, by telling the wife about the infidelity, the author would be outing the usher. The question is whether the author has a moral obligation to the wife to inform her of the cheating, even if it means outing the usher. \n\nThere are ethical considerations here. The usher is in a committed marriage, and he's cheating. The wife has the right to know about the infidelity. However, outing someone without their consent is a serious matter, especially if the person is not ready to come out. The author is in a tricky position because he might be violating the usher's privacy by exposing his sexuality without his consent. \n\nBut the author is also considering doing this because the usher is cheating, which is a betrayal. The author might feel responsible since he was part of the affair. However, the author wasn't the one who initiated the affair; the usher was already in a marriage and chose to be unfaithful. The author's role here is that of a participant, but he might not be the one solely responsible for the cheating.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The author had a relationship with someone who was married, which is cheating. But he didn't know the person was married. However, he should have perhaps checked before getting involved. But if it's a one-time event at a party, maybe that's not feasible. However, the fact that they continued to meet for five more times suggests that the author might have continued the relationship despite the usher's marital status. Wait, but the author found out about the marriage a week ago. So prior to that, he didn't know. So the author might not be aware that the usher was married when he started the relationship. If that's the case, then the author wasn't intentionally cheating on the wife; he was misled. \n\nBut now, once the author finds out, he's in a dilemma. The question is whether he's in the wrong for wanting to inform the wife. If the author does inform the wife, he's helping her know about the cheating but outing the usher. If he doesn't, he's letting the wife remain in the dark. However, outing someone without their consent is a serious breach of privacy, even if the person is cheating. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The author's initial actions (sleeping with the usher when he didn't know he was married) might not be wrong, but once he found out, he's in a position where he has to choose between two bad options. But the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to expose the cheater. \n\nIf the author is in the wrong, it might be because he's violating the usher's privacy by outing him, even if the intention is to inform the wife. But if the author is not in the wrong, it might be because the wife has a right to know about the cheating, even if it means the usher's sexuality is revealed. \n\nI think the key here is whether the author has a duty to the wife versus the usher. The author has a duty of confidentiality to the usher since they were in a sexual relationship. But the wife's rights as a spouse might take precedence. However, the usher's right to privacy about his sexuality is also important. \n\nThe author's initial actions (sleeping with the usher) might not be wrong if he was unaware of the marital status. However, continuing the relationship after knowing the usher is married would be wrong. But the author found out recently and is conflicted. \n\nIn terms of the author's current dilemma, if he decides to tell the wife, he's causing harm to the usher by outing him. If he doesn't, he's letting the wife be unaware of the cheating. But is the author in the wrong for considering telling the wife? \n\nI think the author is in a difficult position, but the fact that the usher is cheating is a betrayal of the wife. The author might not be in the wrong for wanting to inform the wife, but the method of doing so without outing the usher could be a better approach. However, it's likely impossible to inform the wife without revealing his infidelity, which would require outing him. \n\nSo, the author's intention is to do the right thing by the wife, but the means involve outing the usher. If the author proceeds, he's violating the usher's privacy, but perhaps the wife's right to know is more important. However, some might argue that the author shouldn't take that responsibility and should let the wife find out another way. \n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong for considering this, I think it's a nuanced situation. However, the author is not the one who committed the cheating; the usher did. The author was a participant but not the sole wrongdoer. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to inform the wife, but he should consider the consequences of outing the usher. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the answer is A (yes) or B (no). Considering all this, I think the author is not in the wrong because he's trying to do the right thing by the wife, even though the method is complicated. However, others might say that he's in the wrong for violating the usher's privacy. It's a tough call, but I'm leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because the author is trying to inform the wronged party (the wife) about the cheating, which is a valid concern, even though it involves outing the usher.\n"
