I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) question is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author slept with a married man who's in the closet about being gay. The man asked the author not to tell anyone, but now the author is considering exposing him to the wife to prevent further cheating, even though it would out him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's actions. The author had a relationship with someone who was married, which is cheating on his wife. The author didn't know about his marriage initially but later found out. Now they're conflicted between protecting the man's privacy (not outing him) and informing the wife about the cheating.\n\nThe key points here are: \n\n1. The man is cheating on his wife.\n2. The author had consensual relationships with him but was unaware of his marital status at first.\n3. The author knows the man is in the closet, and outing him might cause family issues with his parents.\n4. The author is considering telling the wife, which would out him.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author didn't start the cheating; that's the man's responsibility. The author had a relationship with someone who was already married, which is morally questionable, but perhaps not as much as the man's actions. However, the author now has a dilemma about exposing the cheating, which would involve outing the man. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author decides to inform the wife, that could be seen as a betrayal of the man's trust. But on the other hand, the wife has a right to know her husband is cheating. However, outing him might be necessary to stop the cheating, but it's a violation of his privacy and could cause harm.\n\nThe author's actions depend on their intention. If the author is trying to protect the wife and stop the cheating, maybe they're justified. But by doing so, they're also outing someone against their will. However, the man is already cheating, so there's a conflict between his right to privacy and the wife's right to know.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the primary wrongdoer is the married man for cheating. The author's involvement is problematic but perhaps not as severe. The author's dilemma is about whether to expose the cheating, which would involve outing, which is a separate issue. The author might not be in the wrong if their intention is to help the wife. But they could be in the wrong if they break the man's trust without a valid reason.\n\nBut according to the WIBTA framework, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for exposing the cheater by outing him. The answer hinges on whether the author's actions are justified. If they believe they're doing the right thing to protect the wife, then maybe they're not in the wrong. But if they're acting recklessly and without considering the consequences on the man's life, they might be.\n\nIn many moral frameworks, the duty to inform the wife about infidelity could outweigh the duty of confidentiality, especially if the author suspects the husband isn't the only one. However, outing someone's sexual orientation without their consent is generally seen as wrong, even if the person is cheating. The author's actions involve both exposing cheating and outing, which complicates things.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. The man's cheating is his own fault, but the author's decision to out him might be necessary to stop the cheating. However, the act of outing him could be considered a violation of trust. Depending on the perspective, the author might not be in the wrong if their intention is to protect the wife, but they could also be wrong for violating the man's privacy. \n\nI think the answer leans towards \"No, the author is not in the wrong (B)\" because they are trying to do the right thing by informing the wife about the cheating, even though it has consequences for the man. The primary wrong is the man's cheating, not the author's act of informing the wife. However, the method of informing might be problematic if it involves outing. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, not the method. Since the author is trying to expose a cheater, which is a positive action towards the wife, they might not be in the wrong.\n"
