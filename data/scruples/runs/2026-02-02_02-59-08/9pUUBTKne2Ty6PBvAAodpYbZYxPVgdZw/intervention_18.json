I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author had a series of affairs with someone who is married and gay, and the author is now considering exposing the cheating to the wife, which would also out the man as gay. The author is conflicted between not wanting to out the man and feeling obligated to inform the wife about the cheating.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, cheating isn't a criminal act, so the author isn't breaking the law by not reporting it. However, the author is considering exposing the cheating, which would involve sharing private information. The man is in a committed relationship, and the author had multiple affairs, which they might be complicit in the cheating. The author's initial mistake was not checking if the man was in a relationship before engaging in a relationship themselves. \n\nThe man is in a closeted situation, which adds complexity. Outing someone without their consent could be seen as a violation of their privacy, even if the reason is to expose cheating. The author might be thinking that the wife has a right to know, but the author isn't the one to determine that right. The man's decision to stay in the closet is his personal choice, and the author's role is to respect that unless there's some legal obligation to report, which there isn't here.\n\nAdditionally, the author is using the wife's right to know as a justification, but they aren't the wife's representative. The author's actions could lead to the man being outed against his will, which could have severe consequences for him and his family. The author's friends' family dynamics (like the parents not accepting a gay son) also play a role here. The author's intention to inform the wife might not take into account the man's autonomy and the potential repercussions of outing him.\n\nThe author's own behavior in having multiple affairs with a married man could be seen as unethical, which complicates their position. They might not have the moral high ground to decide to expose the cheating. The dilemma here is between the wife's right to know and the man's right to privacy regarding his sexuality. \n\nIn many ethical frameworks, respecting someone's privacy is important unless there's a direct harm to others. Here, the harm is the cheating, but the author isn't in a position to enforce that. The author's responsibility might be to the man's privacy rather than the wife's knowledge. Also, the author's own actions contributed to the situation. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author is likely in the wrong for considering exposing the man's cheating and his sexuality without his consent. The right action would be to respect the man's privacy and possibly encourage him to come out on his own terms if appropriate, rather than taking it upon themselves to inform the wife.\n"
