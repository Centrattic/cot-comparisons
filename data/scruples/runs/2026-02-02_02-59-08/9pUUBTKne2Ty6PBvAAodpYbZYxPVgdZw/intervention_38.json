I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for considering exposing a cheater, which would out him as gay. The situation is complex.\n\nFirst, the author had a series of affairs with a married man who is in the closet. The man asked not to be outed. Now, the author is conflicted because the man cheated, and the author wants to inform the wife but doesn't want to out him. The author is considering whether they would be in the wrong (WIBTA) if they go ahead.\n\nThe key points here are consent and the potential consequences. The author had consensual relationships with the man, but the man was married and in the closet. The author discovered the infidelity and now wants to tell the wife. But doing so would out him. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, there's a conflict between the wife's right to know about the cheating and the man's privacy regarding his sexual orientation. In many places, being gay is a personal matter, and outing someone without their consent is a violation of privacy. However, cheating breaches the marital contract, and the wife has a right to know if her spouse has been unfaithful.\n\nBut the author is in a tricky spot. They were involved in the affair and now want to inform the wife. If they do, they're essentially exposing both the cheating and the man's sexuality. The question is whether the author has the right to do that. \n\nThe author might argue that the wife deserves to know, but the author's role as an informant is questionable. The author had a consensual relationship, so they're not a third party. However, they might feel guilt from their past actions. The man is in a vulnerable position due to his family's views on being gay. Outing him could lead to family conflict and personal harm to him.\n\nLegally, in some jurisdictions, reporting infidelity might not be necessary, but ethically, it's a gray area. The author's main mistake was getting involved with a married person. Now, trying to correct that by informing the wife might not be their responsibility. The author is using the wife's right to know as a reason, but they might not be the appropriate person to inform her. \n\nAdditionally, the author might be projecting their own guilt. They've cheated before and now are trying to make amends by exposing the cheater. But this could be a way to absolve themselves of guilt rather than helping the wife. \n\nIn terms of the author's responsibility, they aren't the one who should decide to out the man. The man should be the one to come out on his own terms. The author's role here is to consider the man's wishes and privacy unless there's a legal obligation to report. But in most cases, there's no legal requirement to report infidelity. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author is in the wrong by planning to expose the man without his consent. They should respect his privacy and perhaps encourage him to come out on his own time, rather than using the wife's potential right to know as an excuse to out him. The author's actions could cause significant harm to the man and his family, and it's not their place to decide that.\n"
