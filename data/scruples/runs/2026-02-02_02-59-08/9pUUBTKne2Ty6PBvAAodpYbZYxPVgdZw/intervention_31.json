I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to expose a cheater, which would also out him as gay. \n\nFirst, the author had a relationship with someone who was married and cheating. The person is gay and closeted. The author didn't know he was married when they started the affair. Now, the author is conflicted about whether to tell the wife about the infidelity, which would out him.\n\nSo, the main points are: the author had an affair with a married man, the man is gay and closeted, and the author is considering exposing the cheating to the wife, which would reveal his sexuality. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nOn one hand, the author was part of an affair without knowing the full context. They might feel guilty and want to inform the wife. But the man is in the closet, and outing him could have serious consequences for his family and mental health. The author also became close to him, suggesting some level of care, yet the act of cheating is still a betrayal.\n\nThe author's actions led to a situation where they are now dealing with a moral dilemma. The original mistake was engaging in the affair without full knowledge. Now, by wanting to expose the cheating, they might be trying to correct their own mistake but at the cost of outing someone. Is it the author's responsibility to take action here?\n\nThe man is the one who cheated, but he's also in a closeted position. The author's guilt might be driving them to inform the wife, but they have to consider the consequences. Outing someone can be harmful, especially if the family is not accepting. The author's friend's family is mentioned as not being supportive, so this adds another layer.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for wanting to expose the cheater? Well, the author was complicit in the affair. However, the decision to tell the wife involves multiple factors. The author's initial actions were part of the problem, but their intention now is to right a wrong. However, the method (outing) might be problematic. \n\nThe key question is whether the author has the right to interfere in the man's life and his marriage. The author might feel obligated because they were part of the affair, but they didn't know he was married. It's a complex situation where both parties have made choices that led to the current dilemma.\n\nIn terms of ethical judgment, the author's actions were a mistake, but their intention now is to inform the wife. The dilemma is whether the ends justify the means. If the author tells the wife, they protect her but out the husband. If they don't, the husband remains closeted but continues cheating. \n\nThe author's position is complicated. They were part of the affair, but now they're trying to mitigate the damage. The answer isn't straightforward. However, the initial act of engaging in the affair was wrong, and the author's current dilemma is a result of that. So, perhaps the author is in the wrong for initiating the affair in the first place, even if their intention now is to inform the wife. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong in the current situation of wanting to expose the cheater.\n\nGiven that the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but others might argue that the author is trying to do the right thing by informing the wife. However, the act of outing someone can be considered a violation of privacy, even if it's to expose cheating. So, there's a conflict between informing the wife and respecting the man's privacy.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is in a tough spot. They made a mistake by getting involved with a married person, but their current dilemma is about whether to take action that could out the man. Whether they are in the wrong for wanting to expose the cheater depends on the ethics of outing. Since outing can be harmful, even if the intent is to protect the wife, the author might be in the wrong for choosing to out him. Alternatively, some might say the author is not in the wrong because the husband cheated, and the wife deserves to know. But the answer hinges on the balance between the wife's right to know and the husband's right to privacy regarding his sexuality.\n"
