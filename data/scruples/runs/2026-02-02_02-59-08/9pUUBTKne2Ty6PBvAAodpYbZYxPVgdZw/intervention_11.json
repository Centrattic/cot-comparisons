I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a person who had a sexual relationship with someone they met at a wedding but later found out the person is married with kids. The person is also gay and in the closet.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author had consensual relationships with the married man, who was also in the closet. The author didn't know about his marriage or children at the time. Now, they're considering exposing him to his wife, which would out him as gay. The dilemma is between keeping his secret and informing his wife about the cheating.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, there's a conflict here. On one hand, the man is cheating on his wife, which is a betrayal. The wife has a right to know if her husband is unfaithful. On the other hand, outing someone's sexuality without their consent is a serious invasion of privacy, especially if the person is in the closet and the family is not accepting.\n\nThe author's actions so far: they had consensual encounters, respected the man's wish to keep his sexuality private, and now want to inform the wife. But doing so would out him. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering this.\n\nPossible angles: The author didn't know about the marriage when they started the relationship, which might mitigate some blame. However, once they found out, they're faced with a moral choice. But is it their responsibility to inform the wife? The author isn't the one who caused the cheating, so maybe they aren't obligated to step in. However, they might feel a sense of duty because they contributed to the infidelity.\n\nAnother angle is the man's own responsibility. He's the one being unfaithful and hiding his sexuality. The author might not have the right to expose him, even for the right reasons. Also, the author's intention to out him could cause harm beyond the wife, affecting his family and his personal safety if his parents aren't accepting.\n\nConsidering all this, the author is in a tough spot. But ethically, the act of cheating is between the man and his wife. The author isn't the one who breached the marriage. Their role is more of a third party. Informing the wife would involve them in the man's personal issues, which they might not be responsible for. Additionally, outing someone against their wishes is a violation of trust, regardless of the reason.\n\nSo, the author might be overstepping by deciding to expose the man, even with good intentions. They could be causing more harm than good. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for planning to out him, even if their intention is to help the wife.\n"
