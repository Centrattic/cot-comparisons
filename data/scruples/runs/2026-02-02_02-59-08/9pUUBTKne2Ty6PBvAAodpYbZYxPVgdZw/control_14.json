I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is in a situation where they had a sexual relationship with someone who is married and closeted. The key issues here are consent, deception, and the author's responsibility to the married partner.\n\nFirst, the author initially agreed not to out the person because he's gay and not ready to come out. That was a mutual agreement. But later, the author discovers he's married and has children. The author feels guilty because they were cheated on before and don't want to contribute to that.\n\nThe author is now considering exposing the cheating husband to his wife, which would out him as gay. The dilemma is whether to prioritize the wife's right to know about the infidelity or the husband's desire to stay closeted. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in many places, cheating is not a criminal offense, so the author isn't legally obligated to report it. However, ethically, there's a conflict between the author's promise to keep the husband's secret and the potential harm to the wife. \n\nThe husband is in a committed marriage and has children. By having a relationship with the author, he's broken his marital vows. The author, as a third party, might not have a direct duty to the wife unless there's a legal obligation (which there isn't). But the author might feel a moral obligation to the wife, especially if the husband is being deceptive. \n\nHowever, the author's actions in the first place\u2014having a relationship with someone they knew was involved with another person\u2014could be considered problematic. The author might also be in a position where their actions contributed to the situation. \n\nThere's a question of whether the author can report the infidelity without outing the husband. If the author can find a way to inform the wife without revealing his sexuality, that might be a better path. But if outing is the only way, then the author has to weigh the harm of the infidelity against the harm of outing him. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the author's primary wrongdoing might be not respecting the husband's initial request for secrecy, but the situation is complicated because the husband is the one who was unfaithful. The author's responsibility to the wife is unclear since they're not directly related. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to report the infidelity, but there's a moral conflict here. However, the initial relationship might be seen as contributing to the problem. The answer would depend on whether the author's actions in the relationship were consensual and if they knew about the marriage from the start. The author might share some responsibility for the situation. \n\nConsidering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong for considering exposing the cheating but is in a difficult ethical situation. However, the initial relationship with a married person might be seen as morally wrong, but that's a separate issue from the current dilemma. The main question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to expose the cheater. Since the author was deceived by the husband, they might not be in the wrong. So the answer is B (No).\n"
