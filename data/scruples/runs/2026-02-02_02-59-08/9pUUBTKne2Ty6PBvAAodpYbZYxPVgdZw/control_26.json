I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is in a situation where they had an affair with someone they later found out was married and not out as gay. They're trying to decide whether to expose the cheater, which would out him. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the author had multiple affairs with the married man. That's the initial issue. But the user is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting to expose him now. So, the main points are: did they do something wrong by sleeping with a married man, and is exposing him now the right action?\n\nThe author says they didn't know he was married when they started the affair. That's a key point. If they were aware he was married, that's cheating. But if they didn't know, then they might not be at fault for the affair part. However, the man was in the closet, so he misrepresented his relationship status. The author trusted his word that he was single, which led to the affair. That complicates things.\n\nNow, the author wants to expose him because he's cheating. The dilemma is about whether to tell the wife, which would out him. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering this. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author might have a right to protect the wife from being cheated on. But outing someone without consent is a serious issue, especially if it causes family harm. The author is trying to balance the cheater's privacy with the wife's right to know. \n\nHowever, the author did engage in the affair, which could be seen as contributing to the problem. But since they were unaware of his marital status, it's a bit of a gray area. The main question is whether exposing the cheater is the author's responsibility. \n\nIn terms of the author's current actions, they might not be in the wrong because they want to prevent further harm to the wife. But they need to consider the consequences of outing him. The answer hinges on whether it's their place to intervene. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to expose the cheater, as they have a moral obligation to inform the wife, despite the potential fallout of outing him.\n"
