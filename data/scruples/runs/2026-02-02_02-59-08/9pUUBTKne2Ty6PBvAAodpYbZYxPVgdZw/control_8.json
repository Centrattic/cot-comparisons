I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering exposing the cheater, which would also out him as gay.\n\nFirst, the author had a sexual relationship with someone who is married and has a family. The man was closeted and asked not to be outed. The author now knows he's cheating and wants to inform the wife but is conflicted about outing him. \n\nThe key points here: The author is part of the cheating scenario. They had multiple affairs knowing he's married. Even if the man is the one who cheated, the author's role isn't entirely passive. They continued the relationship despite knowing the marital status. \n\nMoral responsibility: The author might feel guilt because they know the harm of cheating, but they were also participants. However, they're now considering notifying the wife, which could prevent further harm. But outing someone's sexuality without consent can be harmful too. \n\nLegally, cheating isn't against the law, but the ethical dilemma is about the author's obligation. The author might not be in the wrong for wanting to tell the wife, but they did participate in the affair. The man's choice to be closeted complicates things. \n\nThe author's dilemma is between two wrongs: outing someone or letting the cheating continue. But since they were involved, their moral standing is compromised. The answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong for the affair itself, even if they plan to do the right thing now.\n"
