I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author of the WIBTA question is in the wrong. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is a 20-year-old male who had a one-night stand with a 23-year-old male usher at a wedding. The usher was married with two kids and is in a closeted relationship. The author found out later that the usher is married, which made them feel guilty because they had slept together multiple times. Now, the author is conflicted between coming out to the wife about the affair (which would out the usher as gay) and not causing family issues for the usher.\n\nThe key points here are: the author had consensual affairs with someone who is married and in a closeted same-sex relationship. The author is considering exposing the husband's infidelity to his wife, which would reveal his sexuality. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nSo, from a moral standpoint, the author initiated a relationship with someone who is married. That's cheating by the husband, but the author is also participating in an affair. The author might not have known about the husband's marriage initially, but if they found out and continued, that's still part of the problem. \n\nThe author is now torn between two wrongs: outing someone's sexuality (which is a serious matter) versus informing the wife of the affair. But the author is part of the problem by being in the affair. The question is if the author is in the wrong. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the author is complicit in the husband's infidelity. Even if the husband is the one who's married, the author's actions contributed to the cheating. The author might feel they have a duty to tell the wife, but they also created the situation by engaging in the affair. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is in the wrong for participating in the affair. Even if the intention now is to do the right thing by telling the wife, the initial action of having sexual relationships with a married man is part of the wrongdoing. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
