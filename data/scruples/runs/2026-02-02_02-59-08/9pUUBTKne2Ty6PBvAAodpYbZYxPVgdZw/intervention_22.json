I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong (A) or not (B). The situation involves a man who had a sexual relationship with a married man who's in the closet. Now he's torn between exposing the cheater (which would out him) or keeping it secret.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author had a relationship with someone who's married and in the closet. He was told not to tell anyone, which he agreed to. But now he knows the man is cheating and wants to inform the wife. The dilemma is whether exposing the man (to tell the wife) is justified.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, so I need to see if that's the case. Let's consider ethics here. The author is in a position where he's been part of an affair. He has a responsibility to the wife, who's been cheated on, but also a confidentiality agreement with the man he's been sleeping with. \n\nIf he tells the wife, he's outing the man, which could have serious consequences for him, especially given his family's potential reaction. On the other hand, the wife has a right to know about the infidelity. But the author isn't directly connected to the wife; he's an outsider. \n\nIs there a duty to inform the wife? Maybe not, since he wasn't in a relationship with the husband. The author's role here is more of a participant in the affair rather than a friend or family member of the wife. The man he had the affair with is the one responsible for his actions. \n\nThe author's obligation to the man to keep his secret versus the wife's right to know. But the author isn't in a position to mediate this. By sleeping with the man, he's part of the problem. The author's options are either to keep quiet or to expose the man, both of which have consequences. \n\nIf he tells the wife, he's breaking his promise to the man and potentially causing him harm. If he doesn't, he's allowing the affair to continue. But is the author in the wrong for either choice? The act of having multiple affairs is the man's wrongdoing, not the author's. The author's dilemma is about whether to expose the cheater, which may not be his place. \n\nIn terms of morality, is the author responsible for the wife's knowledge? Not really. The husband is the one who committed infidelity. The author's role is more of an accomplice, but he's not the one who made the man cheat. So, is the author in the wrong for considering to out the man? Or is the man himself the one at fault?\n\nAlso, the author might be overstepping by trying to inform the wife. The wife should learn the truth from her husband, not a third party. So, the author's action of telling the wife could be seen as violating the man's privacy and trust, which complicates things. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't directly in the wrong for being in a dilemma. His actions (if he chooses to out the man) might be ethically questionable, but the question is whether he's \"in the wrong\" in the scenario. Since he's trying to decide what to do, the fact that he's considering both sides shows he's trying to do the right thing. However, the initial act of having a relationship with a married man (especially knowing the man is in the closet) might contribute to the problem. \n\nBut the main question is about the act of exposing the cheater. If he does so, he's outting the man, which is a breach of confidentiality. If he doesn't, he's not acting. So, is the author in the wrong for either choice? The answer might depend on the ethical framework used. From a deontological perspective, keeping the secret is a promise he made, so breaking it would be wrong. From a consequentialist view, telling the wife might prevent further harm but causes others. \n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but based on the analysis, the author's position is complex. However, the act of being part of the affair and then considering to out someone could be seen as morally ambiguous. But is he in the wrong? Maybe not necessarily. The key is whether he's directly responsible for the harm. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's dilemma is between two unideal options. But the fact that he's part of the affair might mean he's not entirely blameless. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he's trying to decide between moral options, perhaps he's not in the wrong for being in this situation. So the answer might be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
