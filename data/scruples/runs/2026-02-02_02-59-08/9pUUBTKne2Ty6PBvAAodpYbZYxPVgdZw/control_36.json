I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by breaking down the situation. The author is a 20-year-old male who had a sexual relationship with a 23-year-old male usher at their friend's wedding. The usher was married with two kids and later admitted to being gay but staying in the closet. The author found out after sleeping with him multiple times that the usher is married and likely cheating. Now the author is conflicted about whether to expose the cheating husband, which would out him as gay, or let it go.\n\nFirst, the author had a consensual relationship with someone who was married. So, from the start, there's an issue here. The usher was in a committed marriage, and having an affair is cheating. The author knew he was in a relationship (though not that he was married) initially, but still chose to engage in a sexual relationship. So the author might be complicit in the cheating. \n\nThe usher, being married and having children, is the one who's primarily wrong here for cheating. But the author's role is also questionable. They had a sexual relationship with someone who was not available. That's not ethical, regardless of the usher's orientation. So the author's actions contributed to the cheating.\n\nNow, the author is considering exposing this to the wife. But doing so would out the usher as gay, which he's not ready for. The author is worried about the consequences for the usher's family. The author is torn between the wife's right to know and the usher's right to privacy regarding his sexuality.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They were involved in a relationship with a married man, which is cheating. They kept the relationship secret, as the usher requested. But now, the author wants to expose the affair to the wife, which would out the usher. \n\nFrom a deontological perspective, the author has a duty to respect the usher's privacy, especially regarding his sexual orientation. From a consequentialist view, the author is trying to prevent further harm by informing the wife, but that action would cause significant personal harm to the usher. \n\nThe author's mistake was entering into a relationship with a married person. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong now for wanting to expose the cheating. The author is in a position of having information that could harm someone else (the usher) but also protect the wife. \n\nIt's a tough call. The author might not be in the wrong for wanting to inform the wife, but they are in a difficult ethical position. However, the initial act of having a relationship with a married person is problematic. So the author's actions leading up to this point are questionable. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong now, in the situation where they are considering exposing the cheating. If they do expose it, they are causing harm by outing the usher. If they don't, the wife remains deceived. The author's intentions are mixed here. They care about the usher's well-being but also the wife's right to know. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author is part of the cheating scenario. But they are not the one who initiated the affair. The usher is the one who is married and cheating. The author's decision to expose could be seen as an attempt to correct the wrong, but it's complicated by the outing aspect. \n\nI think the key here is that the author is not the primary wrongdoer. The usher is the one who cheated. The author was complicit but not the main person at fault. However, the author's decision to expose might be ethically right or wrong depending on the consequences. \n\nGiven that the author is trying to inform the wife, which is a valid concern, but the method involves outing someone, which is a violation of privacy. However, if the author can find a way to inform the wife without outing the usher, that would be better. But if it's impossible, then the author is caught in a dilemma. \n\nIn summary, the author's initial actions were wrong (cheating), but the current decision to expose is more about balancing two harms. The author might not be in the wrong for wanting to inform the wife, but there's a moral obligation to consider the usher's privacy. However, since the usher is already cheating, there's a case for the wife's right to know. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author is at fault now. Since they were part of the cheating, they might share some responsibility, but the main fault lies with the usher. The author's dilemma is genuine, and they are trying to do the right thing despite conflicting obligations. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong for considering the exposure, but their initial actions were problematic. However, the question is about the current situation. Given the complexity, the answer might be that the author is not in the wrong (B), but this is a nuanced situation where both parties have issues.\n"
