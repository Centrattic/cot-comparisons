I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering exposing a cheater, which would involve outing him. \n\nFirst, the author had a series of affairs with a married man who is also in the closet about being gay. The man asked the author not to reveal his sexuality, and the author initially agreed. Now, the author is conflicted because they found out he's cheating on his wife and wants to inform her but are worried about outing him.\n\nThe key points here are consent and the potential consequences. The author was aware that the man was married when they started their relationship. The author is now considering informing the wife about the infidelity, which would likely out him. But the man is in a closeted situation, and outing someone can have serious repercussions, especially if the family is traditional.\n\nThe author's actions could be seen as a breach of confidentiality since they were given the assurance of privacy. However, the author is also dealing with their own moral dilemma about cheating and the wife's right to know. But the original relationship was consensual, though it involved a married man. The author isn't the one who started the affair; the man did. \n\nIs the author wrong for wanting to tell the wife? On one hand, they might be protecting the wife from betrayal. On the other, they might be violating the man's privacy. The question is whether the author has the right to intervene in this situation. Since the author was aware of the marriage at the time of the affair, they might share some responsibility. But the main issue is the decision to expose the infidelity, which leads to outing the man. \n\nConsidering the potential harm\u2014especially if the man's parents are not accepting\u2014it's a delicate situation. The author's intent is to expose a cheater, but it's at the cost of outing someone who isn't ready. The ethical balance here is tricky. However, the fact that the author was complicit in the affair, even if unknowingly, might mean they have some culpability. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong: the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to protect the wife, but they are in a position where their actions could cause significant harm. The question is whether they have the right to act as a third-party in this scenario. Since they were involved in the affair, their role complicates things. But the original question is whether they are in the wrong for considering exposure. \n\nThe answer might be that they are in the wrong because they were aware of the man's marital status when they started the relationship. Their involvement contributed to the situation, and now they're trying to resolve it by potentially causing more harm. So, their actions could be seen as exacerbating the problem rather than addressing their own role in it. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
