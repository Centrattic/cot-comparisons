I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The person in the scenario is a 20-year-old man who had a sexual relationship with a married 23-year-old man (the best friend's sister's husband) without knowing he was married. The married man came out to the author as gay and wanted to keep it a secret. Now the author discovers the infidelity and faces a moral dilemma: expose the cheating husband to his wife (which would out him as gay) or stay silent.\n\nFirst, the author's initial actions: he had multiple affairs with a married man. That's cheating, right? So he's complicit in the infidelity. But he was unaware of the marriage at the time. The married man is the cheater here. The author might feel guilt because he had a history of being cheated on before, so he's empathizing with the wife's position.\n\nNow the dilemma is whether to tell the wife about the affair, which would out the husband as gay. The author is torn between protecting the husband's privacy and the wife's right to know. The key points here are consent and harm. The author didn't know the husband was married, so the affair wasn't consensual on the wife's side. Also, the husband is in a closeted situation, and outing him could have serious consequences for him and his family.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The question is about the act of exposing the cheater, which would involve outing him. The author is considering exposing the infidelity to the wife, which would reveal the husband's sexuality. The question is whether doing so is wrong.\n\nOn one hand, the author is complicit in the infidelity. On the other, he's trying to inform the wife of the betrayal. However, outing someone without their consent is a violation of their privacy. The husband's privacy is a factor here. The author might not have the right to expose the husband's secret, even if it's to protect the wife. The wife's right to know is important, but the author is not in a position to make that decision. \n\nAlso, the author might not be the best person to approach the wife directly. That responsibility usually falls on the spouse, not a third party. By stepping in, the author could be overstepping, causing family issues, and violating the husband's privacy. So, while the author might feel obligated to protect the wife, the act of exposing the husband could be seen as wrong because it's outing him without consent. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for planning to expose the cheater by outing him.\n"
