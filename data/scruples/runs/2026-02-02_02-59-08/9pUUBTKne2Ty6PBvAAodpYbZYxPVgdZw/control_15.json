I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author here is in the wrong. So the situation is that they had a relationship with someone who's married and gay, and now they're considering exposing the cheater, which would out him. The user is asking if they'd be wrong to do that.\n\nFirst, the author had consensual relationships with the married man, who was in the closet. They didn't know he was married at the time. The man asked them not to out him, and they initially agreed. Now, they found out he's married and want to tell the wife but are conflicted because that would out him. \n\nSo the main question is whether the author is in the wrong if they expose him. Let's break it down. \n\nOn one side, the author is trying to inform the wife about her husband's infidelity, which is a valid concern. Cheating is a serious issue in a marriage, so the wife has the right to know. But the problem is that revealing this information would also out the man as gay, which he's not ready to do. \n\nThe author might be in the wrong if they out him without considering his wishes and the potential consequences on his family. The man did confide in them, and they promised not to out him. Breaking that trust could be unethical, especially if there are family dynamics that could be harmed. Also, the author is using the wife's right to know, but they might not have the authority to decide what's best for the wife. It's possible that the wife would have her own response to both the infidelity and her husband's sexuality, which the author isn't in a position to mediate.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that the wife has a right to know about the cheating, regardless of the consequences. But the problem is that the author's actions could cause additional harm by outing the man, which he didn't consent to. The author is putting themselves in a position where they decide what's best for both parties, which can be problematic. \n\nAlso, the author had a relationship with the man knowing he was in a committed relationship, which is cheating. However, they didn't know he was married at the time. But the fact that they continued the relationship after finding out might be a factor. Wait, the user said they found out a week ago and confronted him. So they did know after the fact, but now they're conflicted about exposing him.\n\nConsidering the man's request for confidentiality and the potential harm to his family, the author might be in the wrong if they go ahead and out him. There's no clear way to inform the wife without outing him, but the author is choosing to prioritize the wife's rights over the man's autonomy. It's a complex situation where both parties have valid claims, but the author's actions could violate the trust established with the man. \n\nSo, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because they're breaking the trust of the man who confided in them and potentially causing harm by outing him without his consent, even if their intentions are to help the wife.\n"
