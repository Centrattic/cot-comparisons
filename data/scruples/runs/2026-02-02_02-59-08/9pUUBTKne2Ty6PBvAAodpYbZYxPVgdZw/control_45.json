I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author of this story is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe author is a 20-year-old male who had a one-night stand with a 23-year-old male usher at a wedding. The usher, who's married with two kids and closeted, asked the author not to tell anyone. They ended up hooking up five more times after the wedding. Then the author found out the usher is married. He confronts him, and the usher is crying, saying he wants to leave his wife but can't because of the kids. The author is torn between not outing him (since his parents might react badly) and the wife's right to know he cheated.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author had consensual relationships with the usher, who was already in a marriage. Since the usher is cheating on his wife, he's the one being unfaithful. The author didn't know he was married when they started, but after finding out, he's in a dilemma about whether to tell the wife. \n\nThe author is considering outing the usher by informing the wife, which would reveal his sexuality. The usher's family is described as intolerant, so outing could have serious consequences. However, the wife has a right to know she's been cheated on, even if it means revealing her husband's sexuality. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. The author had consensual encounters with someone who was married. The usher is the one who cheated, so the author isn't the wrongdoer in that aspect. The author tried to respect the usher's privacy by not coming out initially. Now, the author is considering exposing the cheating to protect the wife, but this would out the usher. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to inform the wife. The key points are: the author had a consensual relationship, the usher is the one in a committed relationship who cheated, the author is trying to do the right thing by alerting the wife, even if it means outing the usher. \n\nHowever, the author is also considering the usher's privacy and family. So there's a conflict between two rights: the wife's right to know she's been cheated on and the usher's right to privacy regarding his sexuality. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author isn't the one who cheated; that's the usher. The author's actions were a mistake but not malicious. The dilemma is about whether to expose the cheating, which could harm the usher's family. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they're trying to inform the wronged party (the wife) about the infidelity, even though it might out the usher. The usher made the choice to be unfaithful and to not come out, which puts the author in a tough spot. The author's intent is to do the right thing by the wife, even if there are unintended consequences for the usher. So the answer is B, No.\n"
