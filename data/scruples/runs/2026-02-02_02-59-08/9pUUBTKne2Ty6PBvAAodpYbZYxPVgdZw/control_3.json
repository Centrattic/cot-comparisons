I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is a 20-year-old male who had a relationship with a married man who's in the closet. They met at a wedding, started sleeping together, and the author respected the man's wishes not to come out. Now, the author found out the man is married and cheating, and he's torn between exposing the cheater and outing him.\n\nFirst, the author didn't know the man was married when they started sleeping. That's a key point. He didn't intentionally cheat on someone else's spouse. He also respected the man's privacy about his sexuality, which is important. Now, he's conflicted about whether to tell the wife, which would out him.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. On one hand, the author was part of an affair, which is unethical. But he didn't know the man was married initially. Also, he's now trying to do the right thing by considering informing the wife. However, outing someone's sexuality without consent is a serious issue. The man is in the closet, and the author knows the family might not accept it. \n\nThe author's main dilemma is between reporting the infidelity (which the wife has a right to know) and outing the man. If the author tells the wife without outing him, that might be better, but there's no clear way to do that here. The author's actions were not malicious; he was deceived and later realized the situation. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he was in a relationship with someone who was married, which is cheating. But since he didn't know about the marriage initially and is now trying to make amends by considering telling the wife, it's a gray area. However, the act of sleeping with a married man, even if the man is cheating, is still infidelity on the man's part. The author isn't the one who's wronged the wife; the husband is. The author's choice to report or not is a moral dilemma, but he's not the one in the wrong here. The husband is the cheater. The author's actions were based on the information he had at the time. So, answer B.\n"
