I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The author is part of a complicated situation involving infidelity and someone's secret sexuality. First, the author had a brief relationship with a married man who is gay and in the closet. The key points here are the author's role and whether they're at fault.\n\nThe author is considering exposing the cheater to his wife, which would reveal his sexuality. The main question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to do that. \n\nOn one hand, the man cheated, which is unethical, and the wife has a right to know. But the author had consensual (though potentially deceptive) encounters with him. The author might feel conflicted because they care about the man's privacy and his family's reaction. However, by sleeping with a married person, the author participated in an affair, which is generally considered wrong. \n\nThe author also promised not to out the man initially when he was closeted. Now, they're considering breaking that promise to inform the wife. This could be seen as a breach of trust. But the wife is the wronged party here. \n\nSo, the author's main mistake was engaging in the affair in the first place. The dilemma about whether to expose the cheater complicates things, but the root issue is the author's own role in the infidelity. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for participating in the affair, regardless of the decision to expose or not.\n"
