I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the WIBTA scenario is in the wrong. So first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe author is a 20-year-old male who had a sexual relationship with a married man (the 23-year-old usher at his best friend's sister's wedding). The man is in the closet, and the author promised not to out him. Now, the author found out the man is married and cheating. The conflict is whether to expose the cheating partner, which would out him as gay, or protect his privacy.\n\nSo, the key points here are consent, deception, and the author's role. The author had a relationship with someone who was married and in the closet. The man was dishonest about his marital status, which the author didn't know at the time. The author now feels conflicted about whether to inform the wife, which would out him.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author did have a consensual relationship with someone who was married. The man's actions were the cheating, not the author's. However, the author might argue that he didn't know the man was married. But if the author had done more due diligence or asked about his relationship status, maybe he would have known. However, in such situations, it's possible the person is hiding their marital status on purpose, especially if they're in the closet.\n\nThe author is now in a dilemma about whether to out the man to the wife. The author's main question is whether this would be wrong. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for considering this. The options are A (Yes) or B (No).\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author is in a tough spot. The man is cheating, which is wrong. The wife has a right to know. However, outing someone without their consent can be a violation of their privacy, especially if they're not ready. The author is trying to balance the wife's rights against the man's privacy.\n\nBut the author is not the cheater here. The cheater is the married man. The author is a victim of deception. So, is the author in the wrong? The act of the author sleeping with a married man might be considered morally questionable, but the user's main question isn't about that. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering exposing the cheater, thus outing him.\n\nIf the author is considering informing the wife, but that would out the man, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for doing so. The answer depends on the ethical perspective. Some might say the wife has the right to know, others might prioritize the man's right to privacy. However, the author was a participant in the cheating relationship, which complicates things. But the author's actions were consensual, based on the information given.\n\nThe key here is that the author is not the one who committed the infidelity. The married man did. The author is now trying to do the right thing, which might involve informing the wronged spouse. The problem is the collateral consequence of outing the man. However, the man's actions (cheating) are the primary wrong here. The author's dilemma is whether to prioritize the wife's right to know over the man's privacy. But the author's initial actions (sleeping with the married man) might be seen as complicity in the cheating, which could be a point against the author. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong regarding the current decision to inform the wife.\n\nIn terms of the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...), the author is considering the consequences of their actions. The author's main question is about whether exposing the cheater (and outing him) is the right thing to do. The answer to whether the author is in the wrong isn't straightforward. But the question is specifically about the author's current action of considering exposure.\n\nIf the author is trying to do the right thing by informing the wife, even though it means outing the man, then perhaps the author isn't in the wrong. However, if the author is complicit in the cheating, that complicates it. But the user's question is whether the author is in the wrong in this situation, so the answer would depend on whether the action of informing the wife is considered wrong.\n\nIn moral terms, the author might not be in the wrong because they are trying to inform the wronged spouse. However, the author could be in the wrong for being complicit in the cheating relationship. But the user's focus is on the current dilemma of informing the wife. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong for considering this action, as it's about informing the affected party, even if it has consequences for the cheater's privacy.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
