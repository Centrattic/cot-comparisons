I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering exposing a cheater, which would also out him as gay. \n\nFirst, the author had a relationship with a married man who's in the closet. The man asked not to be outed, but he's cheating. The author now feels conflicted because they want to inform the wife but don't want to harm the man's family relationships.\n\nLegally, cheating isn't a crime, so there's no legal obligation to report it. Ethically, it's more nuanced. The wife has a right to know she's been cheated on, but outing someone's sexuality without their consent is a violation of privacy. The author is in a tough spot because they're trying to balance the wife's right to know with the man's privacy.\n\nThe man is in a harmful situation, lying to his family and spouse. The author's actions could lead to the wife finding out through another means, which might be more damaging. If the author tells the wife directly, it could lead to the wife discovering the truth, but it also outes the man, which he's not ready for. There's a risk of family conflict, especially if the parents are not accepting. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If they decide to tell the wife, they're helping the wife but hurting the man. If they don't, they might be enabling the cheating. However, the author isn't in a position to enforce the man's decisions. The dilemma is whether the duty to the wife outweighs the duty to the man's privacy. \n\nConsidering all factors, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to inform the wife, but they need to consider the consequences carefully. The answer might be B (No), because the cheater's actions are the main issue, and the author is trying to help the wife. However, outing someone against their wishes complicates it. But since the act of cheating is between the man and his wife, the author's intent to protect the wife's rights could justify it. Still, the method of informing the wife without outing him might be a better approach. But since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, the answer might hinge on whether the author is obligated to protect the cheater's secrets. Since the cheater was deceptive, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for exposing the truth to the wife, even if it out him. So B (No).\n"
