I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the author is involved in a relationship with a married man who's in the closet. They had multiple affairs, and now the author is conflicted about whether to tell the wife, which would out him. \n\nSo, the main issue here is the author's own actions. They were aware the man was married, right? They had a sexual relationship with a married person, which is cheating. The author is now considering exposing the man to the wife, which would out him as gay. \n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. Well, the author is the one who engaged in an affair. Cheating is generally considered morally wrong. The author can't decide whether to inform the wife, which is a separate issue, but the fact that they were in the affair in the first place is a problem. \n\nAlso, the man in question is the one who cheated on his wife. The author is now in a dilemma about exposing him. But the author's actions are part of the problem. They can't just say they're in the right by trying to expose him when they were complicit in the infidelity. \n\nThe author might argue they have a duty to the wife, but the author's own actions are at fault. So, the answer is likely A: Yes, the author is in the wrong because they participated in the cheating, regardless of the man's orientation. The author's moral dilemma doesn't absolve them of their role in the affair.\n"
