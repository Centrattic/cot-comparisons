I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complicated. So the person is in a WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for) scenario where they're considering exposing a cheater, which would out him as gay. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the author had a relationship with a married man, a wedding usher, who's in the closet. They slept together multiple times, but now the author found out he's married with kids. The man is cheating on his wife, and he's also not out as gay. The author is conflicted between wanting to tell the wife about the infidelity (since he's cheating) but also being concerned about outing him, which could lead to family issues because his parents are not accepting of being gay.\n\nSo, the main question is: is the author in the wrong if they tell the wife, thereby outing him? The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical angles here. The man is cheating, which is a betrayal of his wife. The wife has a right to know about the infidelity. However, the author's act of informing the wife would also reveal his sexuality, which he's not ready to disclose. So, the author is weighing the wife's right to know against the man's right to privacy regarding his sexuality.\n\nOn one hand, cheating is a serious matter. The wife is being deceived, and the author has a moral obligation to inform her. On the other hand, outing someone without their consent can cause significant personal and family distress. The author might be seen as violating the man's confidentiality, even if the intent is to help the wife.\n\nBut the author also had a consensual affair with the man, which complicates things. They were part of the cheating themselves. So, the author's judgment here is clouded by their own involvement. Maybe they feel guilty for cheating and now want to do the right thing by telling the wife, but that doesn't absolve them from their part in the situation.\n\nThe dilemma is whether the author's right to expose the cheater outweighs the potential harm of outing him. Since the man is in the closet, the author's action could have severe consequences for him, including family rejection, which might affect the children. However, the wife is being wronged, and she deserves to know the truth about her husband's infidelity.\n\nBut the author isn't the one who cheated; the man did. The author's role was to be an accomplice in the cheating. By not telling the wife, the author is allowing the cheating to continue. By telling the wife, they're exposing the cheater but also outing him as gay. The author's decision could be seen as necessary for the wife's knowledge, even if it causes other issues.\n\nHowever, the author might not be in the right position to decide who gets the information. The man's sexuality is a separate issue from his infidelity. The wife might not need to know about his sexuality, just that he's cheating. But if the author reveals the infidelity, and the wife finds out about his sexuality through that, then it's a byproduct of the author's revelation.\n\nThere's a balance between the wife's right to know and the man's right to privacy. The author's involvement in the affair adds another layer because they're part of the reason the cheater was unfaithful. Maybe the author should consider not getting involved in the first place, but that's in the past.\n\nIn terms of legal or ethical standards, it's a gray area. The author might not be in the wrong for wanting to inform the wife, but they could be wrong for outing the man without his consent. However, the infidelity is a separate issue. The author's dilemma is about whether to prioritize one over the other.\n\nI think the key here is that the author is not the one who committed the infidelity. The man did. The author is in a situation where they have information that could affect both parties. The author's decision to expose the cheater is a moral choice between two harms. Since the wife is being wronged by the infidelity, the author might have a duty to inform her, even if it means outing him. However, they should try to do it in a way that doesn't out him unnecessarily. But if the infidelity is tied to his sexuality (i.e., he's cheating with other men), then the wife might discover his sexuality regardless of the author's actions. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong for telling the wife about the infidelity, even if it leads to her finding out about his sexuality. The author is not the one who caused the infidelity; they're just a participant. Therefore, the author's obligation to the wife's right to know might take precedence over the man's privacy in this case. But since the author is part of the cheating, their judgment might be biased.\n\nAlternatively, the author might be in the wrong for being involved in the affair in the first place, but the question is about the act of exposing the cheater. So the focus is on that decision. If the author tells the wife, they're doing the right thing for the wife but wronging the man by outing him. But the author couldn't find another way to inform the wife without revealing the man's sexuality. In that case, the author's intent is to notify the wife, which is the right action, even if it has unintended consequences. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for trying to inform the wife, even if it out the man. The blame would be on the man for cheating and not being honest, not on the author for exposing the infidelity.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they're acting in the interest of informing the wife about the infidelity, even though it leads to outing the man. The author's intent is to correct a wrong (cheating) and they're not the one who committed it. However, they are part of the cheating, which complicates things. But the question is about the act of exposing, not the previous affair. So the answer is B.\n"
