I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering exposing a cheater, which would out him as gay.\n\nFirst, the author had a relationship with a married man who's in the closet. The man asked them not to reveal his sexuality. The author now knows he's cheating and wants to tell the wife but is worried about outing him. \n\nSo, the main issues here are cheating and outing someone. The author is conflicted between the wife's right to know about the infidelity and the man's right to privacy regarding his sexuality. \n\nCheating is a serious breach of trust, and the wife does deserve to know if she's being cheated on. However, outing someone without their consent can have severe consequences, especially if the person is in a closeted situation. The author might be in a tough spot because they want to do the right thing but don't want to harm someone else's family.\n\nBut the author also had consensual relationships with the man, knowing he was married. That complicates things. They might be part of the problem, even if they didn't know about the marriage initially. However, the key question is whether they're in the wrong for wanting to expose the cheating. \n\nIf the author tells the wife, they risk outing the man, which could be harmful. But the wife has a right to know about the infidelity. However, there's a conflict here between two wrongs: the man's cheating and the potential outing. \n\nThe author's intention is to inform the wife, which is understandable, but the method might involve outing him. The answer depends on whether the author can find a way to inform the wife without revealing his sexuality. If they can, maybe that's the right approach. If not, they might be causing harm by outing him.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to stop the cheating, but they need to find a way to do it without violating the man's privacy. The answer might be B (No), because their intention is to right a wrong, but they need to be careful about the method.\n"
