I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a man who had multiple affairs with a married man, who is also gay and closeted. The key points here are consent, honesty, and the potential consequences of exposing someone.\n\nFirst, the author had consensual relationships with the married man. Even though the man is cheating on his wife, the author didn't know about the marriage initially. The man later admitted he's married but the author continued the relationship. That's a problem because they were both aware of the marital status, making it an affair. The author's actions here contribute to the cheating.\n\nNow, the dilemma is whether to inform the wife. The author is considering exposing the man's infidelity, which would out him as gay. The ethical question is whether the author has an obligation to the wife to tell the truth. Since the author is part of the affair, they might have a duty to inform the wife. However, outing someone's sexuality without consent is a serious breach of privacy. \n\nThe author's responsibility towards the wife versus the man's privacy as a closeted individual. The author might not be in the right to decide to out him, but also isn't entirely wrong for considering it to protect the wife. The complexity here is balancing two wrongs: the cheating and the potential outing. The author's actions were consensual but contributed to the cheating. So, the author's position is complicated. They might not be entirely in the wrong for wanting to inform the wife, but their role in the affair is problematic. However, the main focus is whether the author is in the wrong now. The answer might hinge on whether they have a moral obligation to the wife. If they do, then it's a tough call. But if they decide to out him, they might be in the wrong for violating his privacy. If they don't, they might be complicit in the cheating. The answer likely leans towards A, the author is in the wrong because they were part of the affair and may not have the right to decide to expose the man's secrets, but there's nuance here. Alternatively, if the author is trying to correct their mistake by informing the wife, maybe they aren't in the wrong. But given that they were involved in the affair, it's possible they share some responsibility. Hmm.\n"
