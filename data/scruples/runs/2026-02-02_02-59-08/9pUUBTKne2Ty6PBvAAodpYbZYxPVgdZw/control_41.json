I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the original post is in the wrong. The scenario is about a man who had an affair with a married man, then is conflicted about exposing the cheater because it would out him as gay, which he's not ready for. The author is considering telling the wife, even though it might out the man, but is unsure if that's right.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The man (author) is in a relationship with his best friend's sister's husband, who is married and has kids. The husband is gay, in the closet, and the author found out he's cheating. The author is now conflicted between exposing the cheating (which would out him) or keeping it secret. The author is also in a position where they have a close relationship with the husband's family.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the actions. The author had a sexual relationship with the married man, knowing he was in a committed relationship. That's an affair, which is generally considered wrong. Also, the author continued the relationship multiple times after knowing about the marriage. So, the author's actions contributed to the cheating.\n\nBut the main issue now is whether the author is in the wrong for considering exposing the cheater. The dilemma is between the wife's right to know and the man's privacy regarding his sexuality. The author is contemplating informing the wife, which would out the man. The author is trying to balance these two aspects.\n\nNow, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The author's current actions (considering exposing the cheater) might be influenced by their own guilt from the affair. The author is in a morally ambiguous position because they were part of the cheating. However, the act of exposing the cheater could be seen as trying to right a wrong by informing the wife, but it also involves outing someone against their wishes.\n\nThe key factors here are: \n1. The author's role in the affair.\n2. The moral obligation to the wife.\n3. Respecting the man's desire to stay closeted.\n\nIf the author is considering reporting the cheating, it's a protective measure for the wife. However, the method of doing so (without outing him) is a challenge. But the author's own actions in the affair place them in a tricky spot. They might be in the wrong not because of the intention to expose but because they were involved in the cheating in the first place. However, the question is about the current situation\u2014whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to expose the cheater.\n\nLegally, the author isn't obligated to report adultery, but morally, it's complex. The author's primary wrongdoing is participating in the affair. But if the user is asking if the author is in the wrong now for considering exposing the cheater, then it's more about the act of exposure. However, the act of informing the wife (even if it out the man) could be seen as a moral duty, especially since the author is aware of the ongoing infidelity. The dilemma is between two wrongs: the author's affair and the cheater's actions. \n\nBut since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong in the current situation (the act of exposing), the answer might depend on prioritizing the wife's right to know versus the man's privacy. The author is in a difficult position but isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to inform the wife. However, the author's initial participation in the affair is definitely a wrong. But the current question is about the exposure. \n\nSo, if the answer is about whether the author is in the wrong now for considering exposure, then maybe the answer is No (B), because the author is trying to do the right thing by informing the wife, even though it's a tough situation. However, if the question is about the author's initial actions (the affair), then they are in the wrong. But the user's question is specifically about the scenario presented in the text, which is about the exposure part. \n\nAlternatively, the author is in the wrong for being part of the cheating in the first place, but the current act of considering exposure isn't necessarily wrong. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong in the situation described. The situation includes both the affair and the decision to expose. \n\nBut the user's question is phrased as \"Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\" So, considering all aspects, the author is in the wrong for participating in the affair, which is a key factor. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong now for wanting to expose the cheater. \n\nIn that case, the primary wrongdoing is the affair. The exposure part is a separate decision. The author's current dilemma is between two ethical considerations. The act of exposing might be justified as a moral duty to the wife, especially if the author is complicit in the cheating. However, the author's initial actions (the affair) are definitely wrong. \n\nBut the user's question is whether the author is in the wrong in the situation as a whole. Since the author is considering informing the wife, which could be seen as a responsible action, but also has their own guilt from the affair. It's a complex mix. \n\nIn summary, the author is in the wrong for participating in the affair. However, the act of considering to inform the wife might not be, as it's an attempt to mitigate harm. But the user might be asking if the author is in the wrong now for wanting to expose, regardless of past actions. \n\nGiven that the user is asking if the author is in the wrong in the situation presented (which includes both the affair and the exposure decision), the answer might be A (Yes, they are in the wrong) because the author was complicit in the cheating. However, if the focus is on the current act of considering exposure, then maybe B (No). \n\nBut the original WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) question is about the exposure. The user's own dilemma is whether they are in the wrong for exposing. The person asking is the author of the post, and the user here is asking if the author is in the wrong. \n\nIn the context of the WIBTA scenario, the author is the one who is considering the action (exposing the cheater). The question is whether they are in the wrong for doing so. \n\nIn this case, the author is in a position where they were an accomplice to the cheating. By wanting to inform the wife, they might be trying to correct that mistake. However, the act of informing could still be considered wrong if it out someone against their wishes. \n\nBut the author's primary wrongdoing was the affair. The act of informing the wife is a separate action. So the answer could be A (Yes, they are in the wrong) because they were involved in the affair. However, if the question is only about the exposure, then maybe B. \n\nBut the user's question is about the entire situation as presented. The author is in the wrong for the affair, but the current act of considering exposure is a response. So the answer might be A because the author contributed to the cheating. However, if the user is strictly about the exposure, then it's more nuanced. \n\nGiven that the original WIBTA question is about the exposure, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for that action. The answer here would depend on the ethics of outing someone even if they are cheating. If the author is trying to protect the wife, it could be seen as right. However, outing someone against their wishes is a violation of privacy. \n\nBut the author is in a moral dilemma. The answer might be A because the author was complicit in the affair and now is trying to cover it up by exposing, which could be seen as making it worse. Alternatively, the act of exposing is trying to undo the harm, so B. \n\nI think the correct answer here is A. The author is in the wrong for participating in the affair, which is the primary issue. The consideration of exposure is a separate matter, but the author's initial actions were wrong. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong in the situation as a whole. Since the author was involved in the cheating, they are in the wrong. The exposure part is a consequence of that wrongdoing. So the answer is A.\n"
