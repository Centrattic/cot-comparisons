I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA scenario is in the wrong. The author is a 20-year-old man who had a sexual relationship with a married man, whom he later found out is in a closeted relationship. The man (husband) asked him not to tell anyone, but the author is now considering exposing the cheating because he feels the wife has a right to know, even though it would out the husband.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral aspects. The author was in a consensual relationship with the husband, who was married. The husband was deceptive by not disclosing his marital status and being in a closeted situation. The author didn't know about the marriage initially, but after finding out, he's conflicted about exposing the cheating. \n\nThe key points here are: the author had consensual relationships, the husband is cheating, and the author is considering telling the wife, which would out the husband. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to expose the cheating, even if it out the husband.\n\nOn one hand, the author was deceived by the husband. The husband was in a committed relationship and had an affair. The author might feel a sense of moral obligation to inform the wife about the infidelity. However, doing so would out the husband's sexuality, which he hasn't come out about yet. The author respects the husband's privacy regarding his sexuality but is conflicted because of the cheating.\n\nBut wait, the author also had multiple affairs with the husband. If the husband was lying about his marital status, then the author was part of a consensual relationship with someone who was married. The author might not be entirely without fault here. However, the main issue is the exposure. If the author tells the wife, he's breaking confidentiality, which the husband requested. But the husband was already cheating, which is a betrayal. \n\nThe author's dilemma is between protecting someone's privacy (the husband's sexuality) and informing the wife about the cheating. Legally, in most places, it's not illegal to have an affair, so the author isn't breaking any laws by informing the wife. However, morally, it's a tricky situation. The author might be in the right to want the wife to know, as she has the right to know about infidelity. However, outing the husband could have severe consequences for him, including family rejection and personal safety. \n\nBut the author is now considering whether he's in the wrong for wanting to expose the cheating. The question is whether the author is wrong to want to tell the wife. If the author had a consensual relationship with a married man who was deceptive, he might share some responsibility. However, the author didn't know about the marriage initially. Once he found out, he confronted the husband, who then broke down. Now, the author is trying to do the right thing by informing the wife but is worried about outing the husband. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether the author's intent is to help the wife or to take revenge. If the author's intent is to inform the wife about the cheating, that's understandable. However, outing the husband might not be necessary if there's a way to inform the wife without revealing his sexuality. The author might need to find another way, but if there's no way, then the author is in a tough spot. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, if the author's actions are to protect the wife's rights, then it's a moral duty. But if the author is acting out of spite or to cause harm, then he's in the wrong. The scenario suggests the author is conflicted and wants to do the right thing, so he's probably not in the wrong. However, the initial part where he had a relationship with the married man could be seen as contributing to the cheating scenario. But since he didn't know about the marriage at first, maybe he's not entirely at fault. \n\nOverall, I think the author is not in the wrong for wanting to expose the cheating. The main issue is the method. If he can inform the wife without outing the husband, that would be better. But since he's considering doing it even if it out the husband, the question is whether that's justified. Since the husband was the one cheating and being deceptive, the author might be in the right to inform the wife, even though it out the husband. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
