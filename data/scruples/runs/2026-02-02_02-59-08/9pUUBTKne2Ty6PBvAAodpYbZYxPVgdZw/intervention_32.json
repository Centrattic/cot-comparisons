I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering exposing a cheater, which would out him as gay. The scenario involves a complex moral dilemma.\n\nFirst, the author had a relationship with a married man who is in the closet. They had multiple encounters, and the man is cheating on his wife. The author found out about the marriage and kids and is conflicted about whether to tell the wife. \n\nThe key points here are the rights of the wife versus the man's privacy regarding his sexuality. The author is considering exposing the cheating, which would out the man. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the author had consensual relationships without knowing the man was married. The man is cheating, which is morally wrong. The wife has a right to know about the infidelity. However, outing someone's sexuality without consent can be a serious violation of privacy, especially if it causes family issues. The man might have legitimate reasons for staying closeted, like family disapproval.\n\nBut the author is in a position where revealing the infidelity would also reveal his sexuality. Is there a way to inform the wife without outing him? Maybe through a third party or anonymous means? The author might not be obligated to out him if there's a way to protect his privacy while informing the wife. \n\nAlso, the author's own actions in the situation need to be considered. They engaged in a relationship with someone who was already in a committed relationship. That's a factor in their moral responsibility. However, the main question is about the act of exposing the cheater and outing him.\n\nIf the author's intention is to protect the wife from being cheated on, that's a valid concern. But the method of exposure involves outing the man, which complicates things. The author's dilemma is between two harmful outcomes: letting the wife be cheated on or causing harm to the man by outing him. \n\nIn such cases, it's often advised to consider all possible consequences. If the author can find a way to inform the wife without outing the man, that would be better. But if outing is the only way, the moral obligation might lie with the wife's right to know. However, the author's role in the situation as someone who had an affair with the cheater adds another layer. They might not have the same duty as a third party with no connection.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be in the wrong for wanting to inform the wife, especially if it's to prevent further harm. But the method of doing so without outing the man is crucial. The answer hinges on whether there's an alternative that respects both the wife's rights and the man's privacy. If outing is unavoidable, the author's obligation to the wife could outweigh the harm to the man, but that's a nuanced judgment call.\n"
