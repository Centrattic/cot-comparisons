I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the scenario is that the author slept with a man who is married and in the closet. The author later found out he's married with kids, and now is considering exposing him to his wife to prevent further cheating, even though that would out him as gay.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author had a relationship with someone who was married, which is cheating. The man is in the closet, so the author promised not to out him. Now the author feels guilty and wants to tell the wife, but that would out him. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering this.\n\nSo, the author was part of an affair. They had multiple encounters, which is cheating. The man is married, so the author was involved in an extramarital affair. From a moral standpoint, that's a problem. But the main issue here is whether the author is in the wrong for planning to expose the man to his wife, even if it means outing him.\n\nOn one hand, the author made a promise not to out the man. Breaking that promise could be seen as a betrayal of trust, especially since the man was vulnerable about his sexuality. On the other hand, the author might feel a responsibility to the wife, who is being cheated on, to inform her. However, the author's role here is complicated because they were also complicit in the cheating.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong for considering this? Well, the author was part of the cheating, so they're not exactly an innocent third party. The man is the one who's at fault for cheating and hiding his sexuality. The author's dilemma is whether to prioritize the man's privacy (which they promised to respect) or the wife's right to know. \n\nIf the author tells the wife, it might cause the man to come out, which could be traumatic for him and his family. But the wife is being cheated on, which is a serious matter. However, the author's decision to involve the wife could be seen as crossing a line, especially since the author was part of the affair. They might not have the right to expose someone else's infidelity, even if they were part of it. \n\nAlso, the author might not be the only person the man cheated with. The author's guilt could be valid, but their solution could lead to outing the man, which could have severe consequences for him, especially if his family is not accepting. The author's initial promise not to out him was a key part of their relationship. Breaking that could be a bigger moral issue than the affair itself.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is in the wrong for planning to break their promise to the man, even if their intention is to protect the wife. The author's involvement in the affair first means they have a responsibility to the man's privacy as well, especially since they were complicit. Therefore, the answer would be A.\n"
