I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering exposing a cheater, which would out him as gay. The situation is complex.\n\nFirst, the author slept with a married man who was in the closet. The man was upfront about not wanting to come out yet. The author respected that initially but now feels conflicted because the man is cheating. The author is considering telling the wife but is worried about outing him.\n\nThe key points here are consent and the man's right to privacy. The author was aware the man was in a committed relationship and chose to have multiple affairs. However, the man was honest about his sexuality and his desire to stay closeted. By having a relationship with him, the author participated in his infidelity. \n\nThe author's dilemma is whether to expose the cheating (thus outing him) to protect the wife. Ethically, the wife does have a right to know about the infidelity. But outing someone against their wishes, even for a good reason, can be a violation of their autonomy. The author might be complicit in the man's actions but isn't the one who caused the marriage issues. However, by not informing the wife, the author is allowing the cheating to continue. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? The author didn't know about the marriage at first, but after finding out, continued the relationship. That could be seen as enabling the cheating. However, the author is now trying to do the right thing by considering informing the wife. The question is whether exposing the cheater (and outing him) is the author's responsibility. If the author didn't have a direct relationship with the wife, maybe they aren't the one to inform. But the man's actions are morally wrong, and the author is in a position to help. However, outing him could have severe consequences. \n\nThe answer might be B (No), because the author is trying to rectify a mistake by informing the wife, even if it leads to outing. But there's a nuance here. Alternatively, maybe A (Yes), because the author was part of the cheating and now wants to meddle. It's a tough call. The author's initial actions were wrong in participating in the affair, but their intent now is to correct it. The ethical stance would depend on prioritizing the wife's rights versus the man's privacy. Since the man is in the wrong for cheating, the author's action could be justified as a moral duty, even if it out him. So the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong for trying to do the right thing, despite the complexities.\n"
