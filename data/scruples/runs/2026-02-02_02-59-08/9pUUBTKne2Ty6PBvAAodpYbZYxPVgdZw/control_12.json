I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is in a complicated situation where they had a relationship with someone who's married and gay, and now they're considering exposing the cheating to the wife without outing him. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the author had consensual encounters with the man, who was married. He was in the closet, so the author didn't know he was married. Once they found out, they confronted him, and he admitted to cheating. The author is now torn between protecting the man's privacy (not outing him) and informing the wife about the infidelity.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, cheating is not a crime, so the author isn't breaking any laws by reporting it. However, the ethical aspect is tricky. The author has a moral dilemma: the wife has a right to know she's been cheated on, but outing her husband's sexuality without his consent could be harmful. \n\nThe author considered not involving the wife but felt obligated to act because of their own past experience with cheating. They also care about the man's well-being and his family. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If they choose to inform the wife anonymously, maybe that's a middle ground. But if they out him, that's a violation of his privacy. However, if the wife is being deceived, the author might feel a duty to inform her. \n\nThe key points are consent in their relationship (which there was), and the responsibility to the wife. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to protect the wife, but the method matters. Outing someone without consent is generally wrong, but reporting infidelity can be seen as a moral duty. \n\nSo the answer depends on whether the author can inform the wife without outing the husband. If they can, then they're not in the wrong. If they have to out him, that's a problem. The question is about whether the author is wrong regardless of the method. Since the author is trying to do the right thing by the wife but is conflicted about the means, it's not inherently their fault. However, the act of outing someone is unethical. \n\nBut the author didn't know he was married when they started the affair. They were deceived by him. Now they're trying to correct that wrong. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to expose the cheating, but the method of doing so affects their responsibility. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because they're trying to do the right thing for the wife, but the act of outing could still be problematic. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for exposing the cheater, which could mean outing him. If they do that, they might be in the wrong. But if they find another way to inform the wife, then not. The question is about the scenario where exposing the cheater involves outing him. So the answer could be A (in the wrong) because outing someone without consent is unethical. But the author's intention is to protect the wife, which is a valid concern. This is a tough call. \n\nBut given the options, the answer is likely B. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to inform the wife, even if it involves outing the husband, because they're trying to right a wrong they were part of. However, the ethical dilemma is real, but the question is about being in the wrong. Since they acted with good intentions, maybe B is correct.\n"
