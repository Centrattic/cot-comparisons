I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they had a relationship with a married man who is also gay and closeted. They found out he's cheating on his wife, and now they're torn between exposing him to his wife (which would out him) or keeping quiet.\n\nFirst, let's look at the author's actions. They had consensual relationships with someone who was married. That's a cheating situation. The author knew he was in a marriage, right? Well, they didn't know about the marriage until later. Wait, the story says they found out he's married a week ago. So initially, they didn't know he was married when they started the affair. But then they kept seeing him after finding out. So the problem here is that they continued the relationship knowing he was married. That's part of the issue.\n\nNow, the moral dilemma is whether to tell the wife. The author is considering exposing the cheating, which would also out him as gay. The author is worried about outing him because of his family's potential reaction. But the wife has a right to know about the infidelity.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, let's break it down. First, their actions: they had an affair with a married man. That's cheating, which is generally considered wrong. However, the man was hiding his sexuality and his marriage. The author didn't know about the marriage initially. But once they found out, continuing the relationship could be seen as participating in the cheating, which complicates things.\n\nNow, the main question is whether they are in the wrong for considering exposing him. The options are to either out him (which might cause family issues) or protect him but let the wife remain in the dark about the cheating. The author is torn between these two. From a moral standpoint, some might say the wife has a right to know, so the author should tell her. But others might argue that the author should not get involved and that it's not their place to expose him, especially since it could out him as gay, which is a sensitive issue.\n\nBut the key point here is whether the author is in the wrong for their actions leading up to this. The initial affair is a problem. However, the author is now trying to do the right thing by considering exposing the cheating. The fact that they are conflicted and want to do the right thing might mitigate their wrongdoing. However, the act of cheating itself is still a problem.\n\nBut the original question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). So, considering that the author had an affair with a married man, which is cheating, that's definitely a wrong action. However, the question might be more about whether they are in the wrong for considering exposing him. The user is asking if they would be in the wrong (WIBTA) for exposing the cheater, which would out him. The original WIBTA question is part of the scenario, but the actual question here is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nWait, the user's actual question is about the author's actions in the situation. The author is the one who had the affair and is now considering exposing the cheater. So, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer options are A or B.\n\nIn terms of the author's actions, they had consensual relations with someone who was married without knowing initially. Once they found out, continuing the affair is participating in the cheating. However, the author is now trying to resolve the ethical dilemma by considering informing the wife, which shows they are trying to do the right thing. But the initial affair is still a mistake. However, the main focus of the question is whether the author is in the wrong now, considering their current dilemma.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering exposing the cheater (and outing him). The WIBTA question in the scenario is the author's own question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. So, the answer would depend on whether the author's actions (cheating and then considering exposing) are wrong.\n\nBut in the original WIBTA question, the author is the one who is the cheater. They had an affair. So, they are the one who is cheating on their own part if they are in a relationship? Wait, the scenario says the author is 20M, but the person they had the affair with is married. The author's own relationship status isn't mentioned. Wait, the author is a man, but the person he had an affair with is a man. So the author's own relationship status isn't given. But the key point is that the author had consensual relations with a married man, which is cheating. Therefore, the author is the one who is cheating here. So they are in the wrong for that act. However, the main question is whether they are in the wrong for considering exposing the cheater (the married man) which would out him as gay.\n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer options are A for yes, the author is in the wrong. But the author's current dilemma is whether to expose the cheater. However, the author is also a cheater. So maybe the answer is that the author is in the wrong for the initial affair. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong in the situation described, which includes both the affair and the dilemma about exposing the cheater.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering exposing the cheater (and outing him). The WIBTA question in the scenario is about the author's own action of exposing the cheater. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for that. But the user is not clarifying whether the question is about the initial affair or the current dilemma. However, based on the way the question is phrased: \"Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\" The situation includes both the affair and the dilemma. So we have to assess the overall situation.\n\nThe author had an affair with a married man (cheating), then found out he's cheating, and now is considering exposing him. The author is in a moral dilemma. So, are they in the wrong? Well, the initial act of cheating is wrong. But the current question is about the author's actions now. If the author is considering exposing the cheater, which would out him, is that the author's fault? Or is the author in the wrong for the initial affair?\n\nThe user might be asking whether, given the situation, the author is in the wrong for their entire actions up to now, including the affair and the dilemma. The answer could be A (yes, in the wrong) because they had an affair with a married person. However, if the user is focusing on the current decision to expose, then it's a different angle. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong in the situation, which includes all their actions. So the answer would likely be A because the author had an affair with a married individual, which is cheating, and that's a wrong action. However, the author is trying to correct their mistake by considering exposing the cheater. But the initial act is still wrong.\n"
