I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a complex mix of personal relationships, ethical considerations, and potential consequences.\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The author (a 20-year-old male) had a sexual relationship with a 23-year-old man who is married with two children. The man is in the closet and asked the author not to out him. The author discovered the man's marriage and is now conflicted about whether to expose him to his wife, which would mean outing him. The author is considering coming forward but is worried about the repercussions on the man's family and his own potential guilt.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the different angles. \n\nFirst, the author had a consensual relationship with the man. However, the man was married, so he was cheating on his wife. The author might argue that he didn't know about the marriage at the time, but he now knows and is conflicted about staying silent versus exposing the cheating. \n\nBut there's a problem here: the author is in a position where revealing the truth would out a closeted gay man. The man's sexual orientation is a personal aspect of his identity, and outing someone without their consent is generally considered a serious violation of trust and privacy. However, the man is also committing adultery, which is a separate issue. \n\nThe author's dilemma is between respecting the man's privacy (not outing him) and fulfilling a moral obligation to inform the wife about the infidelity. But the wife's right to know is complicated by the fact that the husband's sexuality is part of the disclosure. If the author tells the wife, he's essentially outing the husband, which could have severe consequences for him, especially given the family's apparent disapproval of homosexuality.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for having the affair? Well, the man was married, so the affair was definitely on his part. The author might not be the one who initiated the relationship, but by engaging in a sexual relationship with a married man, the author was complicit in the infidelity, even if he didn't know about the marriage at the time. However, since he didn't know, maybe that's a mitigating factor. The key issue now is whether the author is in the wrong for considering exposing the husband.\n\nIf the author chooses to come forward, he's prioritizing the wife's right to know over the husband's right to privacy regarding his sexual orientation. But outing someone can have devastating effects, and the husband has the right to be in the closet, even if it's causing him harm. The author's responsibility is a bit murky here. He might feel obligated to the wife, but he's also bound by the initial agreement not to out the man.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, if he decides to expose the husband, he's breaking the trust the man placed in him. However, if he doesn't, he's allowing the wife to remain in a potentially harmful situation. The author's actions are a balance between two wrongs: outing a closeted person versus allowing a spouse to be cheated on without knowledge. \n\nBut the original question is about whether the author is in the wrong for being in this situation. The author's mistake might be getting involved in a relationship with someone he knew was in a committed relationship (even if he didn't know about the marriage at the time). But since the man was in the closet and used his position as an usher at the wedding (possibly through a connection to the author's friend's sister's wedding), there might have been a lack of transparency from the man's side. The author might not be entirely at fault for the affair since he didn't know about the marriage. However, he is now in a position where he has to decide whether to expose the man, which could be seen as a betrayal of trust.\n\nIn terms of the options given, the user is to answer A (author is in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong). Considering that the author is struggling with the decision and the ethical implications, but the primary wrongdoing was the man's infidelity, the author's role might not make him the one in the wrong. The author's actions in considering exposure are a moral dilemma, not necessarily a wrong. However, if the author decides to expose the man, that would be a mistake, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong overall. The initial relationship was consensual, and the author wasn't aware of the marriage. The wrong here is more on the man for being deceptive and cheating. The author's dilemma is about how to handle the aftermath, but the author isn't the one who's wrong in the initial situation. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
