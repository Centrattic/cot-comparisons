I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering exposing a cheater, which would out him as gay. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author is in a one-sided relationship where they slept with someone who's married and in the closet. The man is cheating on his wife and has kids. The author now wants to tell the wife about the infidelity but realizes that doing so would out him as gay, potentially causing family issues. \n\nSo, the author is trying to balance two things: the wife's right to know about the cheating and the man's right to privacy regarding his sexuality. The author is also conflicted because they care for the man and don't want to cause him or his family distress. \n\nThe key points here are consent, privacy, and moral responsibility. The author had consensual encounters with the man, who was deceptive about his marital status. However, the man is closeted, and outing someone is a serious matter. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, there's no law against cheating, but outing someone's sexuality without consent can lead to personal and familial consequences. Ethically, though, it's complicated. The wife has a right to know if her husband is cheating, but the author's role in this is as an external party, not a direct victim. \n\nThe author's initial mistake was entering into a relationship with someone who was married, even if the man was in the closet. The author now faces a dilemma: inform the wife (who might not take the cheating well and could also out him) or remain silent and let the wife be unaware. \n\nOuting someone without consent is generally considered wrong, but in this case, it's tied to infidelity. However, the author isn't the spouse. The moral obligation to inform the wife is debatable. The author might not be in the wrong for trying to do the right thing by the wife, but the method of informing her could be problematic. \n\nConsidering all factors, the author's actions are driven by a desire to uphold moral standards (cheating is wrong), but the means (outing someone) could cause harm. The author might be in the wrong for planning to out him unless there's a way to inform the wife without revealing his sexuality. However, the author's own complicity in the cheating complicates things. \n\nBut the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering exposing the cheater, which would out him. The answer hinges on whether the author has the right to decide to out someone for cheating. Since the author isn't the spouse and the man's privacy is at stake, the author's decision could be seen as overstepping. So, the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
