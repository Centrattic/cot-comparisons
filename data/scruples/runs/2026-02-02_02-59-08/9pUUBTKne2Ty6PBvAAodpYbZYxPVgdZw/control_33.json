I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by breaking down the situation. The author is a 20-year-old male who had a sexual relationship with a 23-year-old male who was a married man with two children. The author found out that this man is cheating on his wife, and now is torn between exposing him (which would out him as gay) to prevent further cheating or keeping quiet to protect his privacy.\n\nFirst, let's consider the key points. The author had a relationship with someone who was married, which is cheating. The author didn't know about the marriage at the time, but after finding out, feels guilty. The man is in the closet, so outing him could have serious consequences, especially given his family's possible reaction. The author is considering telling the wife to stop the cheating but is worried about outing him.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's look at both sides. On one side, the author was in a consensual relationship with someone who was married. The author didn't know about the marriage initially, but after finding out, they're trying to do the right thing by the wife. However, the author is considering exposing someone's private information (his sexuality) to inform the wife about the cheating. \n\nOn the other side, the author is in a difficult position. They were deceived by the married man, and now they're trying to prevent further harm to the wife. The author might not be entirely at fault for the initial relationship if they were misled. However, continuing the relationship after knowing the man is married could be seen as unethical. Also, outing someone's private information without their consent could be a violation of their privacy, even if it's to help the wife.\n\nThe author's dilemma is between protecting the wife's rights to know about the cheating and respecting the man's right to privacy regarding his sexuality. The author is trying to balance these two, but there's a potential harm in both actions. If they expose the man, they might harm his family relationships and mental health. If they don't, the wife remains unaware of the cheating.\n\nEthically, it's complex. The author might not be directly responsible for the man's infidelity, as they were not the one who decided to have a marital relationship. However, they did engage in a relationship with someone they knew was married after the fact. The author's intention to inform the wife is understandable, but the method of doing so by outing the man's sexuality without his consent could be problematic. There might be alternative ways to inform the wife without outing him, like contacting her directly with the information without revealing his sexuality. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author's actions in potentially outing the man to inform the wife might not be entirely their fault. They were in a consensual relationship that turned out to be with a married man, and they're trying to make amends. However, the act of exposing someone's private information without their consent is generally a violation of privacy. Therefore, the author might be in a tricky spot, but whether they're in the wrong depends on the intent and the method. Since the author is trying to do the right thing by the wife but using a method that invades the man's privacy, there's a conflict. However, the primary wrong here might be the married man's infidelity, not the author's decision to inform the wife. The author's moral obligation could be to the wife, but the means of doing so (outing) complicates it. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions are morally ambiguous. They might not be entirely in the wrong given the circumstances, but the method of exposing the man's sexuality raises ethical concerns. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the author is trying to prevent further harm to the wife, but it's a close call. However, the act of outing someone without their consent is generally considered wrong, which could put the author in the wrong. But given the context of trying to correct a wrong done by another person, the answer could be B. Hmm.\n"
