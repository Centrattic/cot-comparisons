I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The author had a series of affairs with a married man who's in the closet. The man is married, has kids, and the author found out about his infidelity. Now they're conflicted about whether to tell the wife, which would out him.\n\nFirst, the author's actions: they had multiple sexual relationships knowing he's married. The man was upfront about being in the closet, and the author agreed not to out him. But the author also didn't check if he was married before sleeping with him. That's a problem. They should have asked basic questions before engaging in a relationship, especially since he was an usher at his sister's wedding. It's possible the author should have realized he was married earlier.\n\nThe moral dilemma is whether to expose the cheating, which would out him. The author argues that the wife has a right to know, but by telling her, they'd be outing him. The author's initial agreement not to out him complicates things. Also, the author's own guilt comes from having been cheated on before, which adds emotional weight.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they engaged in a relationship with a married man, even though he was in the closet. That alone is problematic. They didn't take the time to verify his relationship status before continuing. Now, the question is about whether they should expose him. But the fact that they were involved in an affair gives them a different perspective. They might be trying to absolve themselves by focusing on the wife's right to know, but they were complicit in the cheating.\n\nIf the author is considering exposing him, they're adding another layer of harm. The man's privacy is at stake, and the author's initial agreement not to out him was broken if they proceed. However, the wife's right to know is a valid point. But the author's responsibility here is not just to the wife but also to the man they agreed to keep his secret. \n\nSo, the author is in the wrong for entering into the affair without knowing his marital status. Additionally, by considering exposing him, they might be adding to the harm, even if their intention is to inform the wife. The author's position is complicated by their own role in the situation. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
