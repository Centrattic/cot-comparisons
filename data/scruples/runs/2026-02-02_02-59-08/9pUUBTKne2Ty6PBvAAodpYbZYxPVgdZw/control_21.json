I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the author is part of a relationship where they had multiple affairs with a married man who's also in the closet about being gay. The man asked the author not to tell anyone, and the author initially agreed because they respect his privacy. Now the author is conflicted because they found out the man is married and cheating, and they want to expose him to his wife but don't want to out him as gay. \n\nFirst, the author had an affair with someone who was married. That's a big ethical issue on its own. Cheating is generally considered wrong because it breaches trust in a marriage. The author knew he was in a committed marriage when they started sleeping with him, right? Wait, no, the author didn't know he was married until later. They met at their best friend's sister's wedding, and the man's wife was out of the country. The author didn't know he was married when they first had the affair. So maybe that's a point in their favor? But they continued the affair after finding out he was married. That part is definitely on the author.\n\nThe man is in the closet, so the author is considering exposing him to his wife. The author is torn between protecting his privacy and informing the wife about the cheating. But the author is also part of the reason the marriage is in trouble. If the author wants to inform the wife, they have to out him as gay, which could cause family issues. But the author's actions contributed to the cheating. \n\nSo, the author's main dilemma is whether they should expose the cheater to his wife, even if it means outing him. But the author is also the one who had the affair. So is the author in the wrong for the affair? Yes, because they entered into a relationship knowing he was married, even if they didn't know initially. Wait, they didn't know he was married at first. But after finding out, they continued. That makes it worse. \n\nThe author's options are either to inform the wife (thus outing him) or keep quiet. The author is considering doing the right thing by the wife, but they're also considering the man's privacy. However, the author is complicit in the cheating. So, the author's primary mistake was participating in the affair. That's the main issue. The question is whether they are in the wrong. The answer is A, yes, the author is in the wrong for having an affair with a married man, which is a violation of trust. Even if the man was cheating on his wife, the author's involvement makes them equally at fault. The author's current dilemma is a result of their own actions. So the answer is A.\n"
