I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author, a 20-year-old man, had a series of affairs with a married man who's in the closet. They met at a wedding, slept together, and continued the relationship multiple times. The author found out the man is married with kids and now he's torn between exposing him to the wife and not outing him, which could cause family issues.\n\nFirst, the author had an affair without knowing the man was married. That's a problem. He was in a relationship with someone who was already married, which is cheating. So that part, the author is in the wrong because he was complicit in an infidelity. The man was also cheating on his wife, but the author's role here is still questionable because he didn't know initially, but continued the relationship once he found out? Wait, no, the author found out later, so he didn't know at first. So when he found out, he realized he was involved with a married man. At that point, he had a responsibility to stop the relationship because it's an affair. But the author didn't stop. The question is whether he's in the wrong for having the affair in the first place, which he was, and now considering exposing the cheater.\n\nBut the main question is whether the author is in the wrong now, when he's thinking about exposing the cheater. So the author is conflicted about whether to tell the wife (thus outing the man) or not. The problem is that by sleeping with the married man, the author was part of the infidelity. Even if the man is in the closet, the author's actions contributed to the cheating. So the author is in the wrong for participating in the affair. \n\nAdditionally, when considering whether to expose the cheater, the author's options are to either let the wife know, which would out him, or not do anything. The author might feel a moral obligation to the wife, but by being part of the affair, he's complicating his own position. The author's actions led to the situation, so he's in the wrong for being involved in the first place, regardless of the next step. \n\nSo the answer is A, the author is in the wrong. The key point is that he engaged in an affair with a married man, which is cheating. Even if he didn't know the man was married initially, continuing the relationship after he found out makes it his fault. The dilemma he's facing is secondary; his initial actions were wrong.\n"
