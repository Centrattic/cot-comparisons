I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given scenario is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is in a relationship with someone they met at a wedding. The person is married, has kids, and is gay but closeted. The author had multiple affairs with him, then found out he's married and cheating. Now they're torn between exposing him (which would out him as gay) to his wife or keeping it secret.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. \n\nFirst, the author's actions: They had consensual relationships with the man, who was already married. That's cheating on his wife. But the author didn't know he was married when they started. However, after finding out, they continued. So maybe they were aware and still kept going. That could be a point against them. \n\nThen, the dilemma is whether to tell the wife. The author is considering exposing the man's infidelity and his sexuality, which would out him. The question is if that's wrong. \n\nLegally, cheating isn't a crime. But morally, if you're in a relationship with someone who's married without knowing, it's a gray area. Once you know, continuing is more problematic. The author might be in the wrong for continuing the affair after knowing. \n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong overall, including their current dilemma. The author is conflicted between protecting the man's secret (and his family's reaction) and the wife's right to know. \n\nThe author might not be in the wrong for the affair if they were unaware of his marriage. But once they found out, continuing could be considered wrong. However, the question is about whether they are in the wrong now, regarding the decision to expose him. \n\nChoosing to expose him would be a moral choice, but the author is worried about outing him. The act of exposing could be seen as harmful, but the wife has a right to know about the infidelity. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If they're considering telling the wife, which is the right thing for the wife to know, but outting him, which he's not ready for. The author's initial actions (affair) are questionable, but the current decision is about exposing. \n\nThe answer might hinge on whether the author's actions (both the affair and the decision to expose) are morally wrong. If the affair is wrong because it was consensual without knowing the marriage, then maybe not their fault. But after knowing, continuing is wrong. \n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, considering the whole situation. The answer might be A (yes) because the author was in an affair with a married man, which is typically considered morally wrong. However, if the man was deceptive (lying about his marital status), the author's fault might be less. \n\nAlternatively, the author isn't in the wrong for the affair if they were deceived. The main issue is whether to expose him now. The question isn't about their affair but about the moral dilemma of exposing. \n\nThe user might be implying that the author is in the wrong for being in the affair, but the answer could be that they're not in the wrong because they were deceived initially. However, after finding out, continuing the affair is wrong, making them at fault. \n\nSo, the answer is A (yes) if the author is in the wrong for continuing the affair after knowing. But if they were deceived and only found out later, maybe not. The story says the author found out a week ago and confronted him. Then they're conflicted about telling the wife. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author might not be wrong for the initial part (since they didn't know), but once they knew, continuing is wrong. So, they are in the wrong for continuing the affair. Therefore, Answer A.\n"
