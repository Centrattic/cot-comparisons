I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this scenario is in the wrong. The situation is a bit complex. The author, who is 20M, had a series of affairs with a married man, 23M, who's also the best friend's sister's husband. The man is gay and closeted. The author found out he's married with kids and now is conflicted about whether to tell the wife, even though it would out him.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author had consensual sex with someone who was married and in the closet. The man was upfront about being gay but not ready to come out. The author kept the secret initially but now regrets the affair once finding out about the marriage. The dilemma is whether to inform the wife, which would out the man.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, cheating on someone is generally considered wrong. However, in this case, the cheating was mutual between two men, and the wife is unaware. The author is considering exposing the infidelity to the wife, which would involve outing the man. \n\nEthically, there's a conflict between the right to privacy (the man's right to remain closeted) and the wife's right to know about the infidelity. The author is in a position where they might be complicit in the betrayal if they don't act, but outing someone could harm their family and personal life. \n\nFrom a legal perspective, adultery isn't a crime in many places, but it can affect divorce proceedings. However, the ethical aspect is more about the author's responsibility. The author is not directly responsible for the man's decision to be in a closeted marriage, but they did engage in a consensual affair. \n\nIf the author decides to tell the wife, they might be seen as a whistleblower in the wife's case, but it's also outing someone without consent. If they don't tell, they're potentially enabling the ongoing infidelity. \n\nThe author's initial mistake was engaging in the affair knowing the man was closeted but not aware of his marital status. Now, the dilemma is whether to prioritize the wife's right to know over the man's privacy. \n\nIn most ethical frameworks, the right to privacy is significant, but so is honesty in a marriage. The author might not be in the wrong for wanting to inform the wife, as the wife has a right to know about infidelity. However, the act of outing someone, even to tell the truth, can have severe consequences. \n\nThere's a middle ground if the author can find a way to inform the wife without outing the man, but the scenario suggests that might be difficult. So, the author's decision to expose the cheater is complicated. \n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions\u2014both in the affair and the potential exposure\u2014are problematic. They contributed to the infidelity and are now in a position to reveal it, which could be seen as a moral obligation or a breach of privacy. The answer hinges on whether the author's decision to expose the cheater is justified despite the consequences.\n"
