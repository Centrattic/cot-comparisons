I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering exposing a cheating husband, which would out him as gay. The situation is complex because the author had a series of affairs with the married man, who is in the closet. \n\nFirst, the author is in a dilemma between protecting the man's privacy (not outing him) and informing the wife about the infidelity. The key points here are the author's actions and the potential consequences.\n\nThe author had a consensual relationship with the married man, which is the initial issue. The man cheated, but he's not out, so outing him would mean revealing his sexuality. The author is considering telling the wife, which would involve the man's betrayal but also his identity as gay. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the man is the one who cheated, which is a breach of trust towards his wife. The author was aware he was married and continued the affair, which is also morally questionable. But the main question is about the author's decision to expose the man. \n\nIf the author tells the wife, they are helping the wife know about the cheating, which is her right. However, outing someone's sexuality without their consent is generally considered wrong. But the author might argue it's necessary to protect the wife. The dilemma is between two harms: letting the wife remain in a cheating relationship versus outing the husband. \n\nLegally, the author isn't obligated to inform the wife unless there's a duty of care, which isn't the case here. Ethically, it's a tough call. The author's actions in the affair themselves are questionable. They might be more in the wrong for the affair, but the question is specifically about exposing the cheater. \n\nIf the author does expose him, they're violating his privacy. If they don't, the wife is being deceived. The author's position is morally ambiguous. However, the author might be justified if they believe the wife has a right to know. But since the author was involved in the affair, their motives could be seen as self-serving, like trying to absolve themselves by exposing the man. \n\nIn conclusion, the author is in a difficult situation, but the act of exposing the cheater by outing him might not be their place to decide. The author's own actions in the affair contribute to the problem. So, whether they're in the wrong depends on the perspective. However, the act of outing someone without their consent is generally wrong unless there's a significant justification. Since the author was part of the affair, their decision to expose him could be seen as self-serving, making them at least partially in the wrong.\n"
