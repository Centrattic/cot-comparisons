I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering exposing a cheater, which would out him as gay. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author is in a one-sided sexual relationship with a married man (the usher) who's in the closet. The man asked the author not to reveal his sexuality. The author is now conflicted between the wife's right to know about the infidelity and not outing the man.\n\nSo, the key points here are the ethics of both cheating and outing someone. The married man is the one who cheated, which is ethically wrong. The author was involved in the affair, which could be considered their own mistake, but they're now trying to do the right thing by informing the wife. However, doing so would out the man as gay, which he explicitly asked the author not to do. \n\nOuting someone is a serious breach of trust, especially when the person is in the closet. The author agreed not to out him initially, so breaking that promise could be seen as a betrayal. However, the wife has a right to know about the infidelity. The dilemma is between two wrongs: the man's cheating and the author's potential outing of him.\n\nBut here's the catch: the author was complicit in the cheating. By sleeping with a married man, they contributed to the infidelity. That might make their moral standing weaker. But the author is now trying to correct their mistake by informing the wife. However, the method of informing the wife would involve revealing the man's sexuality, which is a separate issue. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the man is the primary wrongdoer here. The author made a mistake by being in the affair, but their intention now is to right that wrong. However, the act of exposing the affair would out him, which is a violation of his privacy. The author might be trying to do the right thing for the wife but at the expense of the man's privacy. \n\nBut there's a potential alternative: the author could tell the wife about the infidelity without explicitly outing him as gay. Maybe there's a way to inform her through other means, like through his Grindr account, without directly revealing his sexuality. However, the author hasn't explored that yet. \n\nIn terms of moral wrong, the author's actions in the affair were wrong, but their current dilemma is about rectifying that. The real question is whether the author is obligated to expose the cheater, even if it out him. If the author is in the wrong, it's because they were part of the infidelity. But if the focus is on the current decision, the author is trying to address their mistake, which might not make them wrong now. \n\nBut the act of outing someone is a serious matter. The author promised not to out him, so breaking that promise could be seen as wrong. The wife has a right to know, but the author's approach could cause harm to the man's family. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong for being in the affair, but their current decision is a complex moral choice. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong in the situation described. The main issue is the potential outing. If the author proceeds to out him, that's a violation of trust. But if they don't, the wife remains unaware of the infidelity. \n\nIn this case, the author is not in the wrong for considering exposing the cheater. The wrong lies primarily with the married man for cheating and being in the closet. The author's intention is to inform the wife, which is a valid concern. However, the method of doing so without outing him is crucial. If the author can find a way to inform the wife without revealing his sexuality, that would be better. But if not, the moral obligation to the wife might outweigh the promise not to out him, especially since the man is already cheating and may have other affairs. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong). Their mistake is in the affair, but their current dilemma is a moral conflict where they're trying to do the right thing, which is understandable.\n"
