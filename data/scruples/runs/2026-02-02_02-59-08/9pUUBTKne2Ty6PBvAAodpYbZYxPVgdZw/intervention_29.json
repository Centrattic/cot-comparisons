I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author sleeping with someone who is married and gay, and now they're considering exposing the cheater, which would out him, despite his being in the closet.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author had a relationship with a married man who was hiding his sexuality. The man asked the author not to reveal his sexual orientation, which the author initially agreed to. Now, the author is conflicted between the wife's right to know about the infidelity and the potential harm of outing the man, especially considering his family's possible reaction.\n\nThe author is in a position where they were deceived. The man was married and cheating, which is a betrayal of trust. The author might feel justified in wanting to inform the wife because she has a right to know. However, doing so would also out the man, which could lead to other consequences for him, including family issues. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? The author's actions themselves\u2014sleeping with a married man\u2014could be seen as unethical. However, the main question is about the decision to expose the cheater. The dilemma is between two harms: the wife's right to know versus the man's right to privacy regarding his sexuality. \n\nIn some ethical frameworks, one might prioritize the spouse's right to truth over the man's privacy, especially considering the deceit involved. However, outing someone against their wishes could be seen as a violation of their autonomy. The author might not be in the wrong for wanting to protect the wife, but they might also be overstepping by making a decision that affects another person's life without their consent.\n\nAlternatively, others might argue that the author is not in the wrong because they were deceived and are now trying to correct a wrong by informing the wife. However, the act of exposing the affair and outing the man's sexuality could cause significant harm, and the author's responsibility here is unclear. \n\nGiven that the author was involved in the relationship by choice, even if they were deceived about the man's marital status, the question is whether they have a duty to expose this. Since the author wasn't in a relationship with the wife, their obligation might be more about their own actions rather than the spouse's knowledge. However, the moral dilemma here is complex. \n\nConsidering all factors, the author's initial involvement in the affair is questionable, but the core issue is whether exposing the cheater is the right action. The answer might hinge on whether informing the wife is a moral obligation versus respecting the man's privacy. Since the author is also facing internal conflict, it's a nuanced situation. However, since the author is considering outing the man, which could have severe consequences, and they were part of the affair, there's a case that the author is in the wrong for both the affair and the potential exposure. But the question is specifically about the exposure part. \n\nIn WIBTA scenarios, the community often considers the intent and consequences. If the author's intent is to prevent further harm to the wife, maybe that's seen as less wrong. However, the act of outing the man might be considered crossing a line, hence leading to the answer that the author is in the wrong. But I'm a bit split here. Given the options A and B, I think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because they are considering an action that could cause significant harm to another person without a clear ethical justification beyond their own internal conflict.\n"
