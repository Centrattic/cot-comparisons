I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong. So the author is someone who had a series of affairs with a married man who's in the closet. They had sex multiple times, and now they found out he's married. The author is conflicted between exposing the man (which would out him as gay) to the wife or keeping quiet.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the author's actions. They had consensual relationships with the man, who was married and in the closet. The man didn't disclose his marital status or sexual orientation, and the author didn't know. But the author promised not to out him, which they respected initially. Now, the author is considering informing the wife about the cheating, which would out the man.\n\nIs the author at fault for the affair? Well, the man was married, so cheating is wrong regardless. The author didn't know about the marriage at first, but after the first time, the man continued the affair. The author kept meeting him, which could imply some negligence in checking his relationship status. But it's not entirely clear how the author could have known he was married. However, the fact that the man was an usher at his sister's wedding\u2014maybe he's part of their social circle, so it's possible the author could have asked around before sleeping with him. But maybe not, since he was hiding his marriage.\n\nNow, the dilemma is whether to expose the cheater. The author is considering telling the wife, which would out the man. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to do that. The options are A (yes, the author is wrong) or B (no).\n\nIf the author is in the wrong, it would be because they were part of the affair and now want to expose him, maybe out of guilt. But the man was the one who cheated. The author's actions were consensual, but they might have been complicit. However, the key issue here is whether informing the wife is wrong. The author might feel a duty to the wife because she's been cheated on, but outing someone's sexual orientation can have serious consequences. \n\nThe author is in a bind. The man is the one who committed adultery, which is wrong. The author didn't know about the marriage initially. The man lied about his relationship status and sexual orientation. The author now wants to inform the wife, which would out him. But is the author in the wrong for that? The author's main fault is participating in the affair, but the question is whether they're wrong for exposing the cheater now. \n\nIf the author didn't know he was married, maybe they aren't entirely at fault. But after the first time, the man continued the affair, so the author had the chance to stop. Now, the author is trying to do the right thing by the wife, even though it means outing the man. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to do that. The options are whether the author is wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nI think the main issue here is the moral dilemma. The author is trying to decide between protecting the man's privacy (not outing him) or protecting the wife's right to know. Since the man cheated, the wife has a right to know. However, outing the man could cause harm. But the man is the one who committed adultery, so the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to inform the wife. The author's actions in the affair might be questionable, but the decision to expose the cheating is a moral choice. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
