I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering exposing a cheater, which would out him as gay. \n\nFirst, the author had a relationship with a married man who's in the closet. They had multiple encounters, and the man was upfront about being gay but not ready to come out. The author didn't know he was married until later. Now they're conflicted about whether to tell the wife, which would out him.\n\nSo, the key points here: the man is cheating, which is wrong, but he's also in a closeted situation. The author is considering exposing the cheating, which would reveal his sexuality. The question is if the author is in the wrong for wanting to do that.\n\nLegally, cheating is a personal matter between the spouses. The author isn't obligated to intervene. Ethically, it's tricky. The author has a right to privacy too, but they might feel guilty because they were part of the infidelity. However, outing someone without their consent can cause significant harm, especially if the person's family is not accepting. \n\nThe author might think they're doing the right thing by protecting the wife, but it's also possible that there are other ways to approach this, like contacting the wife anonymously. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. If they decide to expose the man, they could be violating his privacy. But if they don't act, they might feel complicit in the cheating. \n\nThe dilemma is between the man's right to privacy and the wife's right to know. Since the author was involved in the cheating, their position isn't entirely neutral. They might have breached their own agreement to keep the man's secret. However, they had no idea about the marriage initially. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author might feel they have a duty to the wife, but they also have a duty to the man's privacy. The answer might depend on cultural and personal values. If the author proceeds, they could be seen as causing harm by outing him, even if the intent is good. On the other hand, if the wife deserves to know, the author's action could be justified. \n\nBut since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, considering all factors, the answer isn't straightforward. The author isn't in the wrong for considering it, but the act itself could be problematic. However, the options are between two wrongs. The answer here would likely be B (No), because the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to expose the cheating, but the situation is complex. However, the act of outing someone without their consent might make them wrong. But given the circumstances, the user is seeking validation, so the answer might be B.\n"
