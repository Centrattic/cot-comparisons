I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering exposing a cheater, which would out him as gay.\n\nFirst, the author had a relationship with a married man who's in the closet. They slept together multiple times, and he asked her not to tell anyone. Now she's conflicted about telling his wife, which would out him.\n\nThe key points here are the author's actions and the potential consequences. The author was in a situation where she had consensual encounters with someone who was married. She didn't know he was married at the time, which might affect the dynamics. However, once she found out, she felt guilty and wants to tell the wife. The dilemma is between the husband's privacy and the wife's right to know.\n\nIs the author at fault for sleeping with a married man? Well, the husband was married, so he was the one who was unfaithful. The author didn't know he was married initially, but she continued the relationship after finding out. That could be seen as her being part of the infidelity. But she didn't know he was married when they first met. However, after she found out, continuing the relationship might be considered wrong because she was aware he was married. So maybe she's partly at fault for continuing the affair after knowing.\n\nBut the main question is whether she's in the wrong for wanting to expose him. The user is asking if she's wrong for choosing to tell the wife, which would out him as gay. The husband is in the closet, so outing him could be a violation of his privacy. However, the wife has a right to know about the infidelity. The author is trying to balance these two aspects.\n\nThe author's initial agreement to keep his secret was part of their arrangement. By breaking that, she might be violating his trust. But the husband was already cheating, so maybe the author's actions in continuing the relationship after knowing are more problematic than exposing him. The question is about her exposing him versus her being in the wrong for her own actions.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the husband is the one who was married and cheating. The author's role in continuing the affair after knowing could be seen as complicit, but she's now trying to do the right thing by informing the wife. However, outing him without his consent might have serious repercussions on his family and his personal life.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If she decides to tell the wife, she's protecting the wife's rights but violating the husband's privacy. If she doesn't, she's letting the husband continue to cheat. The answer might depend on the ethical framework used. From a deontological perspective, lying and cheating are wrong, so the author's initial actions (after knowing) might be wrong. From a consequentialist view, the outcome of telling might have more negative consequences for the husband's family.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author is considering exposing him, she's trying to right a wrong by informing the wife, but she might be overstepping by outing him. However, since she's the one who had the relationship, maybe she's more responsible for her actions. Alternatively, the husband's actions as a married man cheating are more at fault.\n\nThe answer is likely B (No), because the author is trying to do the right thing by informing the wife, even though it's a tough decision. The husband's actions are the primary issue here. The author's decision to expose him isn't inherently wrong because she's trying to address the infidelity. However, there's a nuance in the potential consequences of outing him. But the question is whether she's in the wrong, and since her intention is to inform the wife, it's not entirely her fault.\n"
