I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is a 20-year-old who had multiple affairs with a married man who is also gay and in the closet. The man asked the author not to reveal his sexuality, but now the author is considering exposing the cheating because they feel it's the right thing to do for the wife. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the author had consensual relationships with the man, who is married. The man was dishonest about his marital status and his sexuality. The author didn't know he was married when they started the relationship, which complicates things. The author is considering telling the wife, which would out him as gay.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the relationships were consensual between the author and the man. The author didn't know about the marriage initially. Now, the author is trying to do the right thing by informing the wife, but that action would out the man. The dilemma is between the wife's right to know about the infidelity and the man's desire to stay closeted.\n\nThe author is in a tough spot. On one hand, cheating is wrong, and the wife deserves to know. On the other hand, outing someone without their consent is also a violation of their privacy. However, the author isn't the one who committed the infidelity; the man did. The author's role is more about the consequences of their actions. \n\nThe key points are: the author didn't know about the marriage initially, the relationships were consensual, and the author is trying to report the cheating. The author isn't the cheater, but their decision to inform the wife would out the man. But since the man is the one who cheated, the author is trying to take responsibility by informing the wife, even though it's a difficult choice.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the author isn't the one who committed the infidelity. The man is the one who was dishonest. The author's decision to tell the wife, while causing unintended consequences, isn't inherently wrong because the wife has a right to know. However, the author might be in a moral gray area because outing someone without their consent is serious. But given the circumstances, the author's intention is to do the right thing by the wife. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because they are trying to inform the wronged party (the wife) about the infidelity, even though it involves a difficult choice regarding the man's privacy. The author isn't the one who committed the adultery; the man did. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to expose the cheating, even if it means outing him.\n"
