I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. So the user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA post is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author sleeping with a married man who is gay and in the closet. The author is now conflicted about exposing him to his wife, which also means outing him.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author met the man at a wedding, had a series of affairs without his wife knowing. The man is married, has kids, and is in a closeted relationship. The author didn't know about his marriage initially and later found out. Now the author is torn between telling the wife (which would out him) and keeping it secret.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's consider the ethics here. The man is cheating, which is morally wrong. The author is part of that infidelity. Cheating is a breach of trust in a marriage, so the author's actions contributed to that. However, the author didn't know he was married when they started the relationship. Wait, but the story says the author had multiple encounters after finding out he was married? Wait no, the author says they started sleeping after the wedding where they met, and then later found out he's married. Wait, the timeline: the man was married, his wife was out of the country during the wedding. The author met him at the wedding, slept with him, then continued the affair. The author found out later that he's married. Wait, but how did they meet? The author was at the wedding of their friend's sister, so the man is the friend's sister's husband? Wait, the friend's sister got married, and the man was an usher. So the author is the friend of the friend's sister. The man is married to the friend's sister? Wait no, the friend's sister got married. So the man is the husband of the friend's sister? Wait no, the author is friends with a kid (the friend) whose sister got married. The man is the husband of that sister. So the author is sleeping with the sister's husband, who is married to the author's friend's sister. That's a problem because it's an affair. The author is having an affair with a married man. So the author is complicit in the cheating.\n\nThe man is married and having an affair. The author is in a relationship with him, which is also cheating. So the author is at fault for participating in the infidelity. Even if the author didn't know about the marriage initially, once they found out, continuing the affair would be wrong. Wait, but in the story, the author says they found out a week ago that he's married. Wait, the author says they had a series of encounters after the wedding (five more times). Wait, but when did the author find out he's married? The author says they found out a week ago. So the author slept with him multiple times before knowing he's married. That's a key point. So the author was in an ongoing affair without knowing he was married. But how is that possible? If the man is the husband of the author's friend's sister, then the author should have known he's married. Unless the author didn't know the man's marital status. Wait, the author was at the wedding of the friend's sister, so the man is the newlywed. The author met him at the after-party. So the author should have known he's married. Unless the author didn't realize that he's the husband. Maybe the author didn't know he's married when they started the affair. Wait, but the friend's sister got married, so the man is the husband. So the author is having an affair with the brother-in-law. But if the author didn't know his marital status initially, maybe they met, had sex, and then later found out he's married. But that seems unlikely if they were at the wedding. But maybe the author didn't know he was married until later. Let me re-read the original story.\n\nThe author says: \"He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet.\" So the man told the author he's gay but married. Wait, but when did the author find out he's married? The user says: \"I found out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children.\" So the author didn't know he was married until a week ago. Wait, but if the author was at his wedding, how didn't they know he's married? Unless the author didn't realize who he was. Maybe the author met him at the wedding as an usher, not knowing he was the husband. So the author had sex with the usher, who later revealed to be married. So the author didn't know he was married until after sleeping with him. That's possible. So the author had an affair with someone they didn't realize was married. Then later found out. So the initial affair was unintentionally cheating. But once they knew, they continued hooking up. So the author continued the affair knowing he's married. That's problematic.\n\nSo the author's dilemma is whether to tell the wife, thus outing the man, which would mean revealing his sexuality and his infidelity. The author is now conflicted between the man's privacy and the wife's right to know.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, initially, the affair started without the author knowing the man was married. But once they found out, continuing the affair is cheating on a married man. So the author is complicit in the infidelity. However, the author didn't out the man when he asked not to. The author has a right to privacy as well. But the author is now considering exposing the affair to the wife, which would out him. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering this.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author is in a difficult position. The man is cheating, so the author is part of that. However, the author didn't know initially. Once they found out, continuing the affair is wrong. The author might have a duty to the wife to inform her, but that comes at the cost of outing the man. The author is not the one who is wronged in this scenario. The man is the one who is cheating, and the author is an accomplice, but perhaps not in the wrong in the same way. The author is trying to do the right thing by considering telling the wife, but that's a tough choice. The author's actions are not entirely without fault, but the main wrongdoer is the married man. So whether the author is in the wrong depends on the perspective. The author's dilemma is between two wrongs: outing the man or letting the wife stay in the dark. The author might not be in the wrong for considering telling the wife, as the wife has a right to know. However, the author's affair is also ethically problematic. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong in the situation described. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering exposing the cheater, even if it out him. The answer would depend on whether the author's actions (the initial affair) and the potential exposure are morally justified.\n\nIn summary, the author is part of an affair with a married man, which is ethically wrong. However, the author's intention to inform the wife might be seen as trying to correct a wrong. The author's main fault is participating in the affair. But the question is whether they are in the wrong for considering to expose the cheater. The answer is that the author is not entirely in the wrong for wanting to do the right thing, but their initial actions were wrong. However, the main wrong is the married man's. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong, so the answer would be A (Yes) because the author was part of the cheating, but the dilemma is about whether to expose. However, the question is specifically about the author's current dilemma: \"Is the author in the wrong?\" The answer might be that the author is not in the wrong for considering to tell the wife, but they were wrong to be in the affair. But the options are A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No. The question is whether the author is in the wrong in the situation described. The situation includes both the affair and the dilemma. The author's actions (affair) are wrong, but the question is whether they are in the wrong for considering to expose the cheater. The answer depends on whether the author is at fault for the affair or for the potential exposure. If the user is asking if the person who wrote this (the author) is in the wrong in the situation, the answer is A (Yes) because they participated in an affair, which is generally considered wrong. However, the dilemma is about exposure, which is a separate issue. The user's question is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the situation described. The answer would be A because the author was involved in an affair, which is ethically wrong. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering to expose the cheater. The answer might be B because the author is trying to do the right thing by informing the wife, despite the personal cost. But the initial affair is where the wrong occurred. The answer might be A because the author is part of the cheating, but the dilemma is about exposure. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in the situation, which includes both their actions and the dilemma. The main wrong is the affair, so the answer is A. However, the question is specifically about the author's current actions of considering to expose, which might not be wrong. The user might be conflating the two aspects. The answer is tricky. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in the situation, which includes both their actions and the dilemma. If the focus is on the exposure, then the answer is B (No), because the author is trying to correct the wrong. But if the focus is on the initial affair, then A (Yes). Given the context of the question, the user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for considering to expose, which is part of the dilemma. The answer would be B (No) because the author is trying to do the right thing by informing the wife, even though being in the affair was wrong. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong in the situation described, which includes both the affair and the dilemma. The answer is A because the author is part of an affair, which is wrong. However, the dilemma is about exposure, not the affair itself. The user's question is \"Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\" The situation includes the affair and the dilemma. The main wrong is the affair, so the answer is A.\n"
