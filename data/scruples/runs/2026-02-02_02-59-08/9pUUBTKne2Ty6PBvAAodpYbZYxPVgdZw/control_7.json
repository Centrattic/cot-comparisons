I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for considering exposing a cheater, which would also out him as gay. They had a relationship with someone who's married, and now they're conflicted about whether to tell the wife.\n\nFirst, the author was in a consensual relationship with the married man, which is cheating. But they didn't know he was married when they started. However, they did know he wasn't out and promised not to tell. Now they found out he's married and want to inform the wife but don't want to out him. \n\nThe key points here: The author kept a secret about his sexuality, which he requested. They then had multiple affairs, which is cheating. The author now wants to tell the wife, which would break the man's confidentiality. \n\nBut the author is in a dilemma between protecting the man's privacy and the wife's right to know. However, the author's actions in the first place\u2014sleeping with a married man\u2014were part of an affair. So, ethically, they might be in a tricky spot. Even if they have good intentions, they were part of the cheating scenario. \n\nAlso, the author might not be the only one he's cheated with, as mentioned with Grindr. So, there's a potential ongoing harm to the wife. But the author is trying to do the right thing by informing her, even though it out him. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they were part of the cheating, perhaps they are complicit. However, their intention to inform the wife could be seen as trying to make amends. But the act of exposing someone's infidelity, even if it out them, is a gray area. \n\nOn one hand, the wife has a right to know. On the other, the author is breaking the man's confidentiality. But the author might not be in the wrong because they're trying to right a wrong they were part of. Alternatively, their initial involvement in the affair could make them complicit, so they might be in the wrong for both being part of the cheating and then trying to expose him. \n\nHmm. It's complex. The answer might be that the author is not in the wrong because they're trying to inform the wronged party, even if it complicates the situation. But maybe they are in the wrong for getting involved in the affair in the first place. The question is specifically about whether they're in the wrong for considering exposing him. \n\nThe WIBTA forum often considers intent and consequences. The author's intent is to protect the wife, even though it harms the man's privacy. But since they were part of the cheating, maybe they are in the wrong. However, the act of informing the wife could be seen as trying to correct their mistake. \n\nI think the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong because they're trying to do the right thing by the wife, even if the method is complicated. So, B for No.\n"
