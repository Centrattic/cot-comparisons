I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering exposing a cheater, which would out him. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the author had a sexual relationship with someone who's married and closeted. The man was an usher at a wedding, and they met there. The author didn't know he was married until later. The man is in a closeted relationship, and the author promised not to out him. Now, the author wants to tell the wife about the infidelity but is worried about outing him, which could affect his family, especially his parents who might not be accepting.\n\nSo, the main conflict is between the wife's right to know she's been cheated on and the man's right to privacy regarding his sexuality. The author is torn between these two. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering telling the wife.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the author isn't breaking any laws by not reporting the infidelity unless there's a duty to report. But morally, it's tricky. The man is cheating, which is wrong, but the author is also in a consensual relationship with him. The author's actions led to the affair, even if they didn't know the man was married initially. \n\nHowever, the author is trying to do the right thing by the wife, even if it means outing the man. The problem is that outing someone can have serious consequences, especially if the man's parents are not accepting. The author might be causing more harm than good. \n\nBut the author is also a victim here, having been involved in an affair without knowing the man was married. They might feel a duty to the wife because they know about the cheating. However, the author's role in the cheating is a factor. If the author had known from the start the man was married, they wouldn't have continued the relationship, which implies they contributed to the cheating.\n\nIn terms of ethics, there's a duty not to harm others. Outing someone could harm the man's family and relationships. But the wife has a right to know. The author is in a difficult position where both choices have negative consequences. \n\nConsidering all this, the author is trying to navigate a moral dilemma. They are not the one who cheated; they were involved in a relationship with someone who was already in an adulterous situation. The author is now trying to correct their mistake by informing the wife, but the method (outing) complicates things. It's possible they're not in the wrong because they're attempting to do the right thing despite the potential harm. However, their involvement in the affair is a factor. \n\nBut since the author didn't know the man was married when they started the relationship, maybe they're not entirely at fault. However, the act of continuing the relationship after finding out could be seen as contributing to the cheating. Still, the decision to expose the cheating is a moral effort to do the right thing. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the author is trying to do the right thing even though it's complicated. But there's a nuance here. Alternatively, some might argue the author is in the wrong for being part of the affair in the first place. However, the main question is about exposing the cheater, not the affair itself. Since the author is trying to inform the wife, which is a moral obligation, even if it leads to outing, they might not be in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
