I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a person who had a sexual relationship with a married man who's in the closet. The author is considering exposing the cheating but is worried about outing him. \n\nFirst, the author had consensual sex with someone who is married, which is adultery. Even though the man asked him not to come out, the author didn't know about the marriage initially. But after finding out, the author is conflicted between exposing the cheating and outing the man.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) The author had a relationship with someone married, which is a betrayal of the man's wife. 2) The author is now considering informing the wife, which would out the man. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author doesn't act, he's letting the cheating continue. If he does act, he's outing someone. But the author's initial relationship is part of the problem. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author might feel they have a duty to the wife, but they also have a confidentiality promise from the man. However, the author is not in a position to enforce the man's commitments. The author's actions contributed to the problem by engaging in the affair. So, the author's initial decision to have the affair is part of the issue. \n\nBut the main ethical dilemma is whether to expose the man's cheating. If the author decides to tell the wife, they might be doing the right thing for the wife, but it's still outing the man. However, the author's actions here are a reaction to being part of the affair. The author's primary wrong is participating in the affair without knowing the man was married. \n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong now, considering the dilemma. The answer depends on whether the author should have known about the man's marriage before the affair. Since the author didn't know, but is now considering informing the wife, the author's current action is a moral choice. However, the initial act (affair) could be considered as part of the problem. \n\nIf the author is considering informing the wife, they might be trying to make amends, but the act of outing the man complicates it. So the author's current position is trying to right a wrong, but their initial participation was wrong. However, the question is about the current situation. If the author is now trying to take responsibility, they might not be entirely in the wrong. \n\nBut the user initially thought the author is in the wrong. Considering all factors, the author's primary wrong was entering the affair without knowing. Now, the dilemma is about exposure. The answer hinges on whether the author's current intentions matter. If the author is trying to do the right thing, maybe they're not in the wrong now. But their initial actions were problematic. However, the question is about the current situation. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the author is now trying to take responsibility, even if the initial act was wrong. But the user's question is about whether the author is in the wrong in the scenario presented, which is the current dilemma. The initial act is past, and the current dilemma is about exposing the cheater. The author is conflicted between two wrongs. The author's decision here is a moral choice, not necessarily being in the wrong. So, the answer might be B.\n"
