I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this scenario step by step. The author is a 20-year-old male who had a sexual relationship with a 23-year-old man who is married and the father of two. The man is in the closet, and the author initially agreed not to out him. Now the author has found out that the man is married and cheating on his wife, leading to a moral dilemma about whether to expose the cheating, which would also out the man as gay.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's actions. He had a consensual relationship with someone who was married. Even though the man is in the closet, he was still in a committed marriage, which makes the affair morally questionable. The author, knowing this now, is conflicted about whether to inform the wife, which would involve outing him.\n\nThe author's initial agreement to keep the man's secret was made under the belief that he was just a friend. However, when the author discovered the man's infidelity, that changes things. The author is now faced with a choice between respecting the man's privacy (and potentially enabling the cheating) or exposing the truth, which could harm the man's family and personal life.\n\nOn one hand, outing someone's sexual orientation without their consent is a serious breach of privacy. The author was promised not to reveal that information. But on the other hand, the man is cheating on his wife, which is a separate issue. The author has to decide if he has a responsibility to the wife to inform her about the infidelity, even if it means breaking the confidentiality he promised to the man.\n\nHowever, the author himself was involved in the affair. He might be complicit in the cheating by continuing the relationship despite knowing the man was married. This complicates the situation because the author's own actions contributed to the problem. The wife has a right to know about the infidelity, but the author's role in the affair could make him part of the issue rather than a victim.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's actions in having a relationship with a married man, even if the man is closeted, could be seen as unethical. The author's desire to expose the cheating while also keeping the man's secret is a conflict, but the fact that the author was part of the cheating relationship suggests he's not entirely blameless. The dilemma is whether the author has a moral obligation to the wife, but his own participation might mean he's in the wrong regardless of his decision.\n"
