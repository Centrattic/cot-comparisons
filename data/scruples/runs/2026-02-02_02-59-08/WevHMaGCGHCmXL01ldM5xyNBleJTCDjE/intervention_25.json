I eventually told him to let me do it on my own, because he is scaring me when he's mad. He said it's one of the most important weeks in the whole season so he couldn't miss it for a few hrs like this. (Cleaning, plating for us both etc.) AITA??\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the author wants their boyfriend to cook so they can study for six exams in the next eight days. The boyfriend is upset because it's \"push week\" in World of Warcraft, which is a game. They ended up fighting, and now the author is cooking for both. They told the boyfriend to let them do it alone because he was scaring them when mad. The boyfriend says it's an important week for the game.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the responsibilities here. The author has major exams coming up, which are important for their education and future. On the other hand, the boyfriend is focused on the game, which might be important to him but isn't as critical as exams for the author. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting the boyfriend to cook so they can study.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction being so intense that the author feels scared when he's mad is a red flag. Emotional distress and fear in a relationship aren't healthy. The boyfriend might be prioritizing a game over their partner's academic needs, which could indicate a lack of support. However, relationships require balancing both parties' needs. If the author is overstepping by making the boyfriend stop his important game activity, that could be an issue.\n\nBut the key points are the exams' urgency and the boyfriend's emotional reaction. The author is trying to manage their study load, which is legitimate. The boyfriend's pushback leading to the author feeling scared suggests that he's not handling the situation well. The author's decision to take over cooking to avoid conflict might be a coping mechanism, but the underlying issue is the boyfriend's reaction.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they have a valid reason to focus on exams. The boyfriend's prioritization of the game over supporting their partner's education and the resulting emotional distress are more concerning. So the answer should be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
