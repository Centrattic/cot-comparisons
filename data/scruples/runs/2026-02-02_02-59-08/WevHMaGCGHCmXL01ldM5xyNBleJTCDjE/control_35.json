      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is that the woman (F18) is asking if she's at fault for wanting her boyfriend (M21) to cook so she can study for six exams coming up in eight days, with one the next day. The boyfriend is super mad because it's \"push week\" in WoW, and she ended up cooking for both to avoid a fight. She mentioned that he's scaring her when he's angry and he said it's one of the most important weeks of the season, so he can't miss it for a few hours.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The woman is dealing with a major academic deadline\u2014six exams in a short time. That's a lot of pressure, and needing to focus is valid. On the other hand, the boyfriend has a significant commitment in his gaming schedule, which he considers important. But wait, WoW is a game. The user might think that academic responsibilities should take precedence over gaming. \n\nThe key points here are the woman's academic workload and the boyfriend's reaction. The woman is trying to manage her stress and prioritize studying, which is understandable. The boyfriend's anger and the fact that he's making her cook instead, even though he's the one upset, might indicate that he's not being supportive. Also, she mentions that he's scaring her when he's angry, which is a red flag. Emotional safety is important in a relationship. \n\nThe boyfriend expecting her to cook for both when he's busy with gaming seems like an unfair expectation, especially when she has critical exams. The woman's decision to take over cooking to avoid conflict shows she's trying to de-escalate, but that shouldn't mean she has to sacrifice her study time. The boyfriend dismissing the importance of her exams compared to his gaming push week might be the real issue here. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the woman isn't wrong for needing support during a stressful time. Relationships should involve mutual support. If the boyfriend can't be flexible here, that's his issue. The woman isn't at fault for prioritizing her exams. The answer here is B\u2014she's not in the wrong.\n"
