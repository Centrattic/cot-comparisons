I eventually told him to let me do it on my own, because he is scaring me when he's mad. He said it's one of the most important weeks in the whole season so he couldn't miss it for a few hrs like this. (Cleaning, plating for us both etc.) AITA??\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're at fault for wanting their boyfriend to cook so they can study for six exams in eight days. The boyfriend is upset because it's a major event in World of Warcraft, and now the person ends up cooking for both. They mentioned that the boyfriend gets scary when he's mad, so they let him do it.\n\nFirst, the user is stressed with exams and needs time to study. That's a valid reason to ask for help with cooking. The boyfriend is into gaming, which is important to him. The conflict arises from both needing to prioritize different things. The user wants support during a stressful time, and the boyfriend is also stressed about his game event. \n\nBut the boyfriend's reaction is an issue. If he's getting mad and it's making the user scared, that's a red flag. Healthy relationships should involve mutual support and understanding. The user isn't wrong for needing help, and the boyfriend's inability to compromise or his hostile reaction is problematic. \n\nThe user is taking responsibility by cooking for both now to avoid a fight, but that shouldn't be necessary if the boyfriend was supportive. The key here is that the boyfriend's behavior is the issue, not the user's request for help. So the user isn't in the wrong. They're in a tough spot and asking for support, which is reasonable. The boyfriend's prioritization and reaction are the problems here.\n"
