      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple where the girl (F18) wants her boyfriend (M21) to cook so she can study for exams. The boyfriend is upset because it's \"push week\" in World of Warcraft, which is probably a big event. The girl ends up cooking for both to avoid a fight. She mentions he's scary when mad, and he says it's one of the most important weeks of the season.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girl is preparing for six exams in eight days, which is a significant academic commitment. She's asking for support by having him cook so she can focus on studying. That seems reasonable. On the other hand, the boyfriend is involved in a game event that's critical to him, which he's prioritizing over helping with cooking. He might feel that his time during push week is essential, so he's reluctant to help.\n\nThe girl's main argument is that she needs the time to study, which is a major life priority. The boyfriend's push week in a game might be important to him, but it's a hobby or leisure activity. There's a possible imbalance here\u2014academic responsibilities versus game commitments. However, the boyfriend's reaction is strong; he's mad and the girl feels scared when he's angry. That's a red flag. Healthy relationships shouldn't involve fear or conflict over such things. The fact that the girl is now cooking for both to avoid a fight suggests he's being inflexible. \n\nThe girl's decision to let him cook when he's mad might be a sign of submission due to fear, which isn't healthy. But the root issue is whether her request was reasonable. Cooking for a few hours each day seems like a small ask compared to the importance of her exams. If the boyfriend is unable to compromise, that's his issue, not hers. \n\nHowever, maybe the girl didn't communicate her needs effectively. She might have assumed he would help without explaining the urgency. Alternatively, the boyfriend might have overreacted. The key points are the girl's academic priorities and the boyfriend's fear of conflict. Also, the mention that the boyfriend is \"scary when mad\" indicates a potential problem in their relationship dynamics, which isn't the girl's fault. \n\nSo, considering all this, the girl's request seems valid. The boyfriend's reaction is disproportionate, especially if he's being abusive when angry. The girl's main fault could be not setting boundaries or addressing his behavior, but the primary issue is his inability to support her during a critical time. Therefore, the answer might be that the author is not in the wrong (B), because her need to study is significant, and the boyfriend's reaction is unreasonable.\n"
