      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong. The situation involves the author (F18) asking her boyfriend (M21) to cook so she can study for her exams. The BF is upset because it's \"push week\" in his game, WoW. The author ended up cooking for both because of the argument, and now she's questioning if she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author has six exams in eight days, one tomorrow. It's a critical time for her academics. She's asking her BF to help with cooking, which he refuses because he's focused on his game's important week. He gets angry, and the author feels scared when he's mad, so she tells him to leave her alone. She ends up cooking for both, which she didn't want to do.\n\nNow, considering both sides. The author has a legitimate reason to need help\u2014preparing for exams is a major life event. Students often need support during intense study periods. On the other hand, the BF is also dealing with something important to him, \"push week\" in a game. But how important is that compared to exam prep?\n\nThe BF's reaction seems extreme. If he's getting mad and causing a fight, that's a red flag. The author mentions he's scary when angry, which is a serious issue. Emotional abuse or aggressive behavior isn't acceptable. Prioritizing a game over a partner's academic needs might indicate a lack of support. \n\nHowever, maybe the BF has a right to expect some consideration. But the key here is the BF's response. Getting angry and causing conflict is not a healthy way to handle disagreements. The author's decision to cook for both to avoid conflict shows she's trying to maintain peace, but the BF's reaction is problematic.\n\nAlso, the author is in a vulnerable position with exams and stress. Asking for help is reasonable. The BF not supporting her during this time and becoming hostile could be the issue. The fact that the author feels scared when he's mad is a significant point. That suggests his anger might be more than just disagreement; it could be emotional abuse.\n\nSo, considering all that, the BF's behavior is more in the wrong. The author is justified in seeking help and setting boundaries when he becomes abusive. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
