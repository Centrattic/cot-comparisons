I eventually told him to let me do it on my own, because he is scaring me when he's mad.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post (AITA) is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, a female in a relationship with a 21-year-old male, is asking if it's wrong for her to want him to cook so she can study for her upcoming exams. He's upset because it's \"push week\" for their game, World of Warcraft, and he can't miss it. The author ended up cooking for both of them to avoid a fight and mentioned he gets scary when angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has six exams coming up in eight days, with one the next day. That's a lot of pressure, and needing support from her partner makes sense. On the other hand, the boyfriend is in a critical week for the game, which he considers important. But the author is now cooking for both because he's angry, and she's scared of his anger.\n\nI should evaluate the dynamics here. The key factors are the importance of her exams and his gaming schedule. Exams are academic obligations that can affect her future, while gaming push weeks are time-bound events in a video game. The boyfriend's reaction seems extreme if he's getting angry and making her scared. The author is trying to manage stress by asking for help, which is reasonable. However, the boyfriend's refusal because of his own priorities might be neglecting her academic needs. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong for prioritizing her studies? Probably not. However, the situation might depend on how they communicate. If she asked politely and he's being unreasonable, then the issue is on his side. The fact that she's now cooking for both to avoid conflict suggests that he's being inflexible. Also, the mention of him scaring her is a red flag. Healthy relationships shouldn't involve fear or anger over such matters. \n\nSo, the author's request is valid, and the boyfriend's reaction is inappropriate. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
