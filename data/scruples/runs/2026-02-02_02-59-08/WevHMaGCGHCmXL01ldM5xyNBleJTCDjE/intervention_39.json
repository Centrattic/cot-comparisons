I eventually told him to let me do it on my own, because he is scaring me when he's mad. He said it's one of the most important weeks in the whole season so he couldn't miss it for a few hrs like this. (Cleaning, plating for us both etc.) AITA??\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about their boyfriend cooking instead of them because the author needs to study for six exams coming up in eight days. The boyfriend is upset because it's a big week for his game (WoW push week), and now the author is cooking for both. The boyfriend mentioned it's important for him to play during that time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is under a lot of academic pressure with exams, which is a valid reason to need time to study. Cooking is a shared responsibility, but if the author is overwhelmed, it's reasonable to ask for help. However, the boyfriend is also facing a significant event in his game, which he considers important. He might feel that helping with cooking takes away from his time. The author mentioned that the boyfriend is mad and even scares them when angry, which is a red flag. The boyfriend's reaction might be over the top, especially if he's not considering the author's stress.\n\nOn the other hand, the author initially asked for help, which is fair. If the boyfriend is unwilling to assist, maybe the expectation was unreasonable. But given the circumstances (exams), the author's need to study is pressing. The fact that the boyfriend is upset about cooking and the author is now doing it alone suggests there's a communication issue. However, the key point is that the author is in a stressful situation and needs support, not added pressure. The boyfriend's reaction leading to the author feeling scared might indicate that he's not being considerate of her stress. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for needing help with exams. It's a balance of mutual support. If the boyfriend is unwilling to compromise and is being hostile, that's his issue. The author's actions are understandable. The boyfriend's reaction might be the problem here. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
