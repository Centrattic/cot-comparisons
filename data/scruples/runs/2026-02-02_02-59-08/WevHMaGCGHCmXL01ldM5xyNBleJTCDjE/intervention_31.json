I eventually told him to let me do it on my own, because he is scaring me when he's mad. He said it's one of the most important weeks in the whole season so he couldn't miss it for a few hrs like this. (Cleaning, plating for us both etc.) AITA??\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting their boyfriend to cook so they can study for exams. The boyfriend is upset because it's \"push week\" in WoW, which is probably a game. The author ended up cooking for both after a fight.\n\nFirst, the author has six exams in eight days, one of which is tomorrow. That's a lot of pressure, so asking the boyfriend to cook could be reasonable to save time. On the other hand, the boyfriend is also dealing with an important game event. He's upset because he can't take a few hours to help. The author mentioned that he's scaring her when he's mad, which is a red flag. Healthy relationships shouldn't involve fear.\n\nThe boyfriend might feel that his priorities aren't being respected, but the author is stressed about exams. However, the key point is the fear the author experiences when he's angry. That's a sign of a problem in the relationship, not just about cooking. The author is taking on cooking now to avoid conflict, which isn't healthy either.\n\nSo, the question is about whether the author's request is fair. It depends on communication and understanding. But since the boyfriend's anger is making her scared, that's a bigger issue. The author might not be in the wrong for needing help, but the relationship dynamics are problematic. The answer might be B because the author isn't wrong, but the boyfriend's behavior is the main issue. However, if the author is expecting the boyfriend to prioritize her needs over his own important event without discussion, maybe she's partly at fault. But the fear aspect points more towards the boyfriend being in the wrong.\n"
