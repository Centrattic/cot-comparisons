I eventually told him to let me do it on my own, because he is scaring me when he's mad.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a romantic partner (F18) asking her bf (M21) to cook so she can study for six exams over eight days, one the next day. The bf is upset because it's \"push week\" in WoW, a game. The woman ends up cooking for both, and the bf is mad. She mentions that he scares her when angry.\n\nFirst, the main points: She needs help to study, which is a valid academic priority. He's prioritizing gaming, which might not be as critical. The fact that she's in a high-stress period with exams is important. The bf's anger and the fear she feels when he's mad are red flags. Even if both have priorities, his reaction seems excessive and possibly disrespectful. Cooking is a shared responsibility, but she's taking on more because he's unwilling to compromise. The key here is that she's prioritizing her education, which is a major life goal, and he's not being supportive. The fact that he's upset about a game during a time when she's under academic pressure might indicate poor prioritization on his part. Also, if he's being scary when angry, that's a sign of possible emotional abuse. The writer isn't in the wrong for needing help and setting boundaries. So, the answer is B (No).\n"
