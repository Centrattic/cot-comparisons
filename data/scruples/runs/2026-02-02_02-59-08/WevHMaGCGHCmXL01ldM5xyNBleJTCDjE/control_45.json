      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author is a female 18, her boyfriend is male 21. She wants him to cook so she can study for her six upcoming exams in the next eight days, one tomorrow. He's really upset because it's push week in World of Warcraft, and to avoid a fight, she's now cooking for both of them.\n\nShe mentioned that when she told him to let her do it alone because he was scaring her when he's mad, he said it's one of the most important weeks of the season and couldn't miss it for a few hours. The author is asking if she's in the wrong (AITA). The options are A for yes, B for no.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has major exams coming up, which is a significant academic commitment. She's asking her boyfriend to take over cooking duties for a short period to help her study. On the other hand, the boyfriend is focused on an important event in his game, World of Warcraft, which he considers crucial. However, the time required is a few hours, which seems manageable compared to the importance of exams, which are life-changing for someone 18 years old. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is intense\u2014mad, leading to the author feeling scared. That's a red flag. If he's so upset that he's making her feel unsafe, that's a problem in the relationship. The fact that she had to take over cooking to avoid a fight suggests there's some imbalance in their priorities and communication. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the boyfriend has valid reasons for needing to focus on the game, but the reaction seems disproportionate. The author is trying to balance her education with the relationship, which is a valid concern. The boyfriend's inability to compromise during a stressful time for her could indicate a lack of support. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author is trying to manage her responsibilities, which is reasonable. The boyfriend's response is problematic because it's causing conflict and making her feel scared. The key point here is that the boyfriend's reaction is extreme and affects her well-being. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. Her needs for studying are valid, and his reaction is excessive. The boyfriend should be supportive of her exams, especially given their impact on her future. The fact that he's causing her to feel scared is a serious issue, and the author has every right to ask for help without facing such a negative reaction.\n"
