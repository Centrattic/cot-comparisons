      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is at fault here. So the situation is that the author, a woman in her late teens, wants her boyfriend, who's a bit older, to cook so she can study for six upcoming exams in eight days. But the boyfriend is really upset because it's \"push week\" in World of Warcraft, which I think is a game, and he can't miss it. The author now ends up cooking for both of them to avoid a fight. She mentioned that he's scaring her when he's angry and that he can't miss a few hours for cooking.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the balance of responsibilities in a relationship. Cooking for a partner is a common task, but when one person is under a lot of stress, like exams, it's reasonable to ask for help. The boyfriend's argument is that this is an important week for the game, but exams are also a significant stressor for the author. However, the boyfriend's reaction being so intense that he scares her is a red flag. Healthy relationships involve mutual support and respect for each other's priorities.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend is also dealing with his own commitments in the game. But he's asking her to cook when she's busy studying, which could be seen as not considering her situation. The fact that she's taking exams that are crucial for her future might mean that her academic responsibilities should take precedence. However, the boyfriend's reaction suggests that he might not be prioritizing her needs, which is a problem.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The author asked for help, which is reasonable, but the boyfriend refused, leading to conflict. She now has to take on both cooking and studying, which might not be fair. However, the boyfriend's argument that it's an important week for him is his justification. The question is whether his refusal to help is valid given her exam schedule. Since she's in a critical period for her exams, not being able to focus because of household duties could impact her significantly. The boyfriend's anger and the fear it's causing in the author suggest that he's not handling the situation well, which could mean the author isn't at fault here. \n\nBut maybe there's a middle ground. Perhaps they could have compromised, like taking turns helping with cooking or finding another solution. The fact that the author is now cooking for both when she was initially asking him to do it might indicate that she's not standing up for herself enough. However, the boyfriend's threatening behavior is a bigger issue. In any case, the author's main point is that she's stressed about exams and needs support, which should be a priority. The boyfriend's refusal to help in a reasonable way might make him at fault, so the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
