      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about the author (AITA) asking if they're at fault for wanting their boyfriend to cook so they can study for six upcoming exams over the next eight days, with one exam the next day. The boyfriend is upset because it's \"push week\" in World of Warcraft, which he considers important. The author mentions that the boyfriend gets mad and even scared them, leading to her now cooking for both of them to avoid conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author is under a lot of academic pressure with exams, which is a valid reason to need time to study. On the other hand, the boyfriend is focused on his gaming schedule, which he deems crucial. The key points here are the balance between their priorities and how they're handling the conflict.\n\nThe author's justification is that they need time to study, which is understandable. However, the boyfriend's reaction is intense\u2014he's \"super mad\" and the situation escalated to the point where the author feels scared. That's a red flag. Healthy relationships involve mutual respect and communication. If the boyfriend is reacting with anger to a reasonable request (like cooking for a few hours), that's not healthy. The author is trying to manage their responsibilities, and asking for a short break in cooking duties isn't unreasonable, especially given the time constraints of exams.\n\nBut wait, maybe the boyfriend's push week is also important to him. However, the key issue here is how he's handling it. Insisting on his priorities to the point of causing fear in the relationship is definitely problematic. The author is prioritizing their academic responsibilities, which are time-sensitive and critical. The boyfriend should ideally be supportive, even if he has his own commitments. The fact that the author feels scared when he's mad suggests that there might be underlying issues in the relationship, like emotional abuse or lack of communication.\n\nHowever, the author's initial stance is that they want the boyfriend to cook so they can study. If the boyfriend is willing to cook at other times but this one instance is a problem, maybe the author could have adjusted or communicated better. But given the exam timeline, time is limited, so asking for help is reasonable. The boyfriend's reaction is excessive if he's expecting her to manage both studying and cooking during a critical exam period. His anger leading to the author feeling scared is a significant issue. So the author isn't wrong for needing time to study, and the boyfriend's response is the real problem here. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
