I eventually told him to let me do it on my own, because he is scaring me when he's mad.

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a boyfriend and girlfriend with conflicting priorities. The girl is stressed about upcoming exams and wants him to cook so she can study. The boyfriend is upset because it's an important \"push week\" in World of Warcraft, a game. They end up in a situation where they argue, and the girl ends up cooking for both to avoid a fight. She also mentions that when he's mad, he scares her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girl has six exams in eight days, which is a significant academic responsibility. It's reasonable for her to want to focus on studying. On the other hand, the boyfriend is involved in a major game event that requires his attention. Both are important to them, but the timing is clashing.\n\nThe key points here are about mutual respect and communication. The girl asked for help with cooking so she could study, which is a common request in relationships. However, the boyfriend's reaction being angry and making her feel scared is a red flag. Emotional distress and intimidation, even if unintentional, are not acceptable in a healthy relationship. \n\nThe fact that the girl now cooks for both to avoid conflict shows she's trying to maintain peace, but that might not be fair if the underlying issue of his anger isn't addressed. The boyfriend should be supportive, especially during her stressful exam period. If he's unable to prioritize her needs when it's critical, that reflects poorly on his ability to be a supportive partner.\n\nHowever, the boyfriend also has legitimate interests in his gaming commitments. The problem might be more about how he handled the situation rather than the request itself. The girl's right to ask for help isn't wrong, but the boyfriend's response was inappropriate. The fact that he's causing her fear when angry is a serious issue that needs addressing beyond just this situation.\n\nSo, weighing both sides, the girl isn't in the wrong for wanting support during exams. The boyfriend's reaction and inability to compromise are problematic. Therefore, the answer should be B\u2014she's not in the wrong.\n"
