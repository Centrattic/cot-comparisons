I eventually told him to let me do it on my own, because he is scaring me when he's mad. He said it's one of the most important weeks in the whole season so he couldn't miss it for a few hrs like this.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author (F18) is stressed about upcoming exams and wants her boyfriend (M21) to cook so she can study. But he's really upset because it's \"push week\" in World of Warcraft, which he considers super important. Now she's the one cooking for both, and he's mad. She mentioned he's scaring her when he's angry, and he argues that he can't miss the push week for a few hours.\n\nHmm. So first, I need to consider both sides. The author has a valid reason: exams are important, especially if they're coming up soon. She's trying to manage her time effectively. On the other hand, the boyfriend's push week in WoW is a significant event for him, which he can't miss. The key here is balancing personal priorities and mutual respect in a relationship.\n\nWait, the author is asking if she's in the wrong. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong. But maybe not. Relationships require compromise. If the boyfriend is prioritizing gaming over helping with cooking, especially when the author is under stress, that could be a problem. But if the author is making a request for help during a critical time for the boyfriend, there's a balance to consider.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend's reaction is intense\u2014he's super mad and scaring her. That's a red flag. How he's handling the situation is important. Arguing and making her take over cooking when she asked for help isn't healthy. The author's right to feel scared is valid. \n\nBut the original question is about who is in the wrong. The author wanted help, which is reasonable. The boyfriend's push week might be important to him, but relationships should involve support. If he can't adjust even for a few hours, maybe that's a bigger issue. However, the author's request might be a bit self-centered, not considering his priorities. But given his response, he's not being supportive either.\n\nSo, considering the situation, the author isn't in the wrong for asking for help with cooking to study. The boyfriend's reaction and inability to compromise might be more at fault. But maybe the author could have communicated better, checking if he's available during push week. However, the main issue is his reaction and the lack of support from him. So the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
