I eventually told him to let me do it on my own, because he is scaring me when he's mad. He said it's one of the most important weeks in the whole season so he couldn't miss it for a few hrs like this. (Cleaning, plating for us both etc.) AITA??\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the person (the author) is at fault for wanting their boyfriend to cook so they can study for six exams over 8 days. The boyfriend is upset because it's \"push week\" in World of Warcraft, and now the author ends up cooking for both. The key points here are the exams, the boyfriend's WoW commitment, and the resulting conflict.\n\nFirst, the author has a significant academic deadline coming up. Exams are important and require focused study time. Asking a partner to help with chores to create study time isn't unreasonable. The boyfriend, however, is in the middle of a crucial phase in a game, which seems like a personal priority. The author felt they had to take over cooking after a fight, which makes them question if they're wrong.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems to be about his own priorities conflicting with the author's needs. The author isn't demanding the boyfriend to sacrifice his own time entirely but just wants assistance during a stressful academic period. The boyfriend's frustration might be misplaced if the author's exams are time-sensitive. Also, the author mentions feeling scared when the boyfriend is angry, which adds an emotional component. The boyfriend's insistence on his gaming time without flexibility could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nBalancing both priorities is important in a relationship. While the boyfriend's commitment to his game matters, supporting each other during critical times is essential. The author isn't wrong for seeking help to focus on exams, especially since the exams are time-sensitive. The boyfriend's reaction might indicate a lack of understanding or support. So, the author isn't at fault here.\n"
