I eventually told him to let me do it on my own, because he is scaring me when he's mad. He said it's one of the most important weeks in the whole season so he couldn't miss it for a few hrs like this. (Cleaning, plating for us both etc.) AITA??\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a girl wanting her boyfriend to cook so she can study for exams, but he's upset because it's \"push week\" in WoW. They ended up in a fight, and now she's cooking for both, but he's mad. She's scared when he's angry.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out both sides. The girl has a lot of exams coming up, one tomorrow. It's a critical time for her. She's asking her bf to help with cooking so she can focus on studying. On the other hand, the bf is saying this is an important time for him too, playing WoW. He's upset that she's asking him to cook during this week. The girl ended up cooking for both, but he's still mad. She's also scared of his anger.\n\nSo, the key points here are about priorities and communication. The girl is trying to manage her academic responsibilities, which are time-sensitive. The boyfriend has his own priorities with the game. The conflict arises from different priorities. The question is whether her asking him to cook is unreasonable. \n\nFrom the girl's side, she's under a lot of pressure with exams. It's reasonable to need help, especially when she's stressed. The boyfriend's response, however, seems to prioritize his game over her academic needs. That could be a problem because exams are a major life event, whereas \"push week\" in a game is temporary. However, the boyfriend might feel that his game is important to him, and she's not respecting that. \n\nBut the fact that she's scared when he's mad is a red flag. It suggests that his anger is affecting her emotional well-being. That's a serious issue regardless of the situation. Even if there's a conflict of priorities, his reaction being so intense that she's scared is a problem. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? She's asking for help during a critical time, which is understandable. The boyfriend's refusal and anger might be the bigger issue here. The author isn't necessarily wrong for needing help. However, maybe she could have communicated better or considered his feelings more. But given the circumstances, exams are a significant responsibility. \n\nI think the boyfriend is being unreasonable by not helping when she's in a crisis. The fact that he's upset about the game during her exam week could indicate that he's not prioritizing her needs adequately. Also, his anger leading her to fear him is a major concern. So the author isn't in the wrong for needing help; the boyfriend is being inconsiderate. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
