I eventually told him to let me do it on my own, because he is scaring me when he's mad. He said it's one of the most important weeks in the whole season so he couldn't miss it for a few hrs like this. (Cleaning, plating for us both etc.) AITA??\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple where the girl wants her boyfriend to cook so she can study for six upcoming exams in eight days, one of which is tomorrow. The boyfriend is upset because it's \"push week\" in World of Warcraft, which he considers super important. The girl ended up cooking for both after a fight.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate both sides. The girl has a major academic commitment with exams coming up. Preparing for exams is a significant responsibility, and she might be feeling stressed. On the other hand, the boyfriend is upset because he's in the middle of an important gaming event. But the girl mentioned that he's scaring her when he's mad, which is a red flag. His reaction seems excessive if he's losing his temper over something like cooking.\n\nThe girl's request seems reasonable. Asking for help with cooking so she can study is a way to manage her time and stress. The boyfriend's response might be showing a lack of support, especially since exams are a critical time for students. Also, the fact that she now has to cook for both after a fight suggests that he wasn't accommodating, which could be a problem in the relationship. His prioritization of gaming over her academic needs, especially when she's already stressed, might be selfish. Plus, his anger being so intense that she feels scared is a serious issue, regardless of the situation. So the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
