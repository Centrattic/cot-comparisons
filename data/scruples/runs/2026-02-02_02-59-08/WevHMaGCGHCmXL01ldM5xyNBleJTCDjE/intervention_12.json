I eventually told him to let me do it on my own, because he is scaring me when he's mad. He said it's one of the most important weeks in the whole season so he couldn't miss it for a few hrs like this. (Cleaning, plating for us both etc.) AITA??\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting their boyfriend to cook so they can study for exams. The boyfriend is upset because it's a crucial week for him in World of Warcraft. The author ended up cooking for both after a fight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has six exams coming up, one the next day. That's a lot of pressure. It's reasonable they'd need time to study. On the other hand, the boyfriend's game push is important to him. But why is cooking a big deal here? Maybe they have a routine where he usually cooks, and the author is taking over, causing friction.\n\nThe key points: The author is stressed with exams and wants help. The boyfriend is upset because he's focused on his game. The author ended up cooking for both to avoid conflict but feels scared when he's angry. That's concerning. The boyfriend's reaction might be over the top, but the author's request is for support during a critical time.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, asking for help when overwhelmed is understandable. However, maybe the author didn't consider the boyfriend's feelings or the timing. But given the exam situation, it's a valid request. The boyfriend's anger and the author feeling scared are red flags. Communication might be an issue. The author shouldn't be expected to cook for both if they're stressed. So, B (author not in the wrong) seems right. The boyfriend's reaction is more problematic here.\n"
