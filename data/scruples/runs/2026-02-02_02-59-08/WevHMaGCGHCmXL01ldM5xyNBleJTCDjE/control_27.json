I eventually told him to let me do it on my own, because he is scaring me when he's mad.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person is at fault here. The situation is that the girl wants her boyfriend to cook so she can study for her exams. Her boyfriend is upset because it's \"push week\" in WoW, which is probably a critical time for his gaming. They end up fighting, and she starts cooking for both to avoid conflict. She mentions that he's scary when angry and that he can't miss a few hours for cooking.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girl has six exams coming up in eight days, so her priority is studying. It's reasonable for her to ask for help with chores to focus on her studies. On the other hand, the boyfriend is invested in his gaming, and the user mentions it's an important week. However, the key point here is the response when she asked. If he was unable to help, maybe they could have compromised. But he got so angry that she felt scared, which is a red flag. \n\nThe fact that she had to take over cooking because he was upset suggests that he wasn't considering her needs. Prioritizing gaming over a partner's academic needs might not be balanced. Also, his reaction being scary indicates possible emotional issues or lack of communication. \n\nIn relationships, mutual support is important. If he's not willing to help during her stressful time, maybe there's an issue with how responsibilities are shared. However, she did take initiative to do the cooking herself after the fight, which shows she tried to resolve it. But the root problem is his reaction and the imbalance in support. \n\nSo, the girl isn't in the wrong for needing help with exams. The boyfriend's refusal and the resulting conflict place him in a more questionable position. Therefore, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
