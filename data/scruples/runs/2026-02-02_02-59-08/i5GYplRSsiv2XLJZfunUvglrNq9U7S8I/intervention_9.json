I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who kicked a guest out is in the wrong. The scenario is a party where the guest was being left alone and kept saying no one was talking to him. The host tried to help by introducing him and suggesting he join activities, but he refused. Then the host tells him to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the host's responsibility. They invited people, including a coworker's friend, even if it was a plus one. The guest was awkward, but is the host responsible for ensuring every guest is socializing? Maybe not. The host did make an effort to include the guest, but when the guest refused to participate, they decided he should leave.\n\nOn the other hand, the guest might have been shy or uncomfortable. But the host's time is limited, and they might be hosting for their own enjoyment. It's a balance between being considerate and maintaining the event's environment. The host might argue that they can't force social interactions, especially if the guest is being passive. However, asking someone to leave after just a few attempts to help could be seen as harsh. But maybe the host felt it was necessary to not let the guest disrupt the party further.\n\nI think the key points are whether the host gave sufficient opportunities for the guest to engage and whether the host's actions were reasonable. The host tried a couple of times to integrate the guest. The guest, however, didn't reciprocate. The host's decision might be justified if they felt the guest wasn't making an effort. It's a bit of a grey area. Some might say the host is in the right because they can't be responsible for every guest's social skills. Others might think it was harsh. But given the host's perspective, they might not be in the wrong.\n"
