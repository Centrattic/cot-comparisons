I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they had a party, and there was a guest who was a plus one but not really, meaning maybe they weren't sure if he was supposed to be there. The guest kept saying people weren't talking to him, even after the author tried to help by introducing him to someone with similar interests. Then the guest refused to join a game or mingle, so the author told him to leave.\n\nHmm. The key points here: The guest was invited as a plus one but maybe not explicitly. The author tried to help him integrate, but he didn't make an effort to socialize. The author got annoyed and asked him to leave. The coworker (his friend) thought it was harsh, but the author defended their action by saying the guest wasn't making an effort.\n\nI need to consider if the author overstepped. Hosting a party comes with the responsibility of managing the environment. If someone is not engaging and is being resistant to social efforts, the host might feel it's necessary to remove them to maintain the party's atmosphere. However, kicking someone out for not socializing could be seen as harsh, especially if the guest was just shy or struggling. But the author did make efforts to help, and the guest kept refusing. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author should have given more time or considered that the guest might be introverted or uncomfortable. But the situation here seems to escalate quickly. The guest was given options, and he refused. The author might feel it's not their responsibility to force someone to socialize. \n\nSo, the author's actions could be justified if they felt the guest was disrupting the event or not respecting the social norms. However, some might argue that it's unkind to ask someone to leave because they're not engaging, unless they're being disruptive. The line here is between maintaining the party vibe and being considerate of someone's social anxiety. \n\nI think it's a bit of a grey area, but leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because they tried to help and the guest wasn't making an effort. However, others might think it's too harsh. But given the details, maybe B is the right answer.\n"
