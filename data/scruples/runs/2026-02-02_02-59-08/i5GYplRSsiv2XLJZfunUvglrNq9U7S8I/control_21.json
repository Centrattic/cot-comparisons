I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for kicking out a guest who wasn't socializing.\n\nFirst, the situation: The host had a party and noticed a guest was being awkward and not interacting. They tried to help by talking to him, introducing him to others, suggesting activities, but he kept standing alone and refused to engage. The host then told him to leave, and the coworker friend was upset.\n\nNow, considering the host's perspective: Hosting a party is a social event, and guests are expected to participate to some degree. The host made efforts to include the guest, but after multiple attempts, the guest still didn't engage. The host felt it was their responsibility to manage the party environment, and if someone isn't contributing or causing discomfort, removing them might be necessary.\n\nFrom the guest's side: He might have felt anxious or out of place. However, social events usually require some initiative from attendees to mingle. If he was truly uncomfortable, maybe he should have communicated that earlier or left on his own rather than expecting others to force interactions.\n\nThe coworker friend is upset, which suggests there might be a cultural expectation of politeness. But the host is also within their rights to set boundaries for their event. It's important to consider if the guest was making the environment uncomfortable for others. If others were being affected by his presence, the host's action is justified.\n\nHowever, the host's approach of directly telling someone to leave could come off as harsh. Maybe a more diplomatic approach, like a private talk, could have been better. But the host did try to help and gave multiple chances. \n\nUltimately, while the host's method might be a bit direct, the underlying issue is about social responsibility in a hosted event. The guest's refusal to make an effort might be the crux here. So the host isn't entirely in the wrong, but there could be room for a more considerate approach. Given the options, B (not in the wrong) seems appropriate.\n"
