I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves a party where a guest was kicked out for not socializing. I need to analyze the details and decide if the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, the setup: The author hosted a party, and a guest came with a coworker but wasn't directly invited. The guest seemed awkward, and the author tried to help by talking to him and introducing him to others. The guest kept saying no one was talking to him, even after being introduced. Then he refused to join a game and eventually was told to leave. The coworker (the guest's friend) thought it was harsh, but the author defended their decision.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. The key points here are the responsibility of the host and the guest's actions. As a host, it's reasonable to expect guests to make an effort to socialize, especially if the event is for people who know each other. The guest's friend was invited, but the plus one wasn't. The guest might have felt out of place, but the author did make attempts to integrate him. However, the guest didn't take initiative, which is on him. The author's frustration is understandable because they can't be responsible for every guest's social interactions indefinitely.\n\nBut was it wrong to kick him out? If the guest was causing discomfort or not respecting the host's event, then maybe not. Hosts have the right to maintain the atmosphere they want. However, some might argue that the author could have handled it more gently, like having a private conversation instead of making an announcement. Yet, the author did try to help multiple times before asking him to leave. The coworker's reaction might be valid, but the author isn't obligated to cater to every guest's needs beyond a reasonable effort.\n\nIn terms of social norms, it's expected that guests at a party will engage to some extent. If someone is unwilling to make even a small effort, the host isn't wrong to ask them to leave, especially if it's affecting the event's dynamics. The author isn't in the wrong here because they provided opportunities for the guest to socialize and then set a boundary when those efforts failed. The answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
