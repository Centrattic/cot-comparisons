I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for kicking out a guest who wasn't socializing. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The host had a party with friends and coworkers. A guest, a friend of a coworker, came separately. The host tried to help him integrate by talking to him, introducing him to someone with similar interests, and suggesting he join a game. But he kept standing alone and said no one was talking to him after refusing to mingle or join the game. The host then told him to leave if he wasn't going to participate. The guest left, and the host's coworker (his friend) thought it was harsh. The host is now questioning if they were wrong.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to decide between A (yes, the author is wrong) or B (no, they are not). \n\nLet me consider the host's perspective. They were trying to be helpful, offering multiple opportunities for the guest to engage. The guest didn't take initiative, perhaps expecting others to approach him. The host had other guests and responsibilities, so maybe they felt it was necessary to maintain the party's atmosphere. \n\nOn the other hand, the guest might have had social anxiety or was just shy. The host's direct approach could be seen as abrupt or not considering the guest's feelings. Telling someone to leave because they're not socializing might come off as dismissive, even if the host tried to help. \n\nBut the host did make efforts to include the guest. They talked to him, introduced him, and suggested activities. The guest didn't make an effort to connect after that, so the host's frustration is understandable. Parties can be stressful, and the host has to manage the environment. If the guest was a one-time invitee and wasn't contributing to the social aspect, the host might have a right to ask him to leave if he's not engaging. \n\nHowever, the line between being a passive guest and being inconsiderate is thin. The host could have handled it more gently, maybe by giving him a bit more time or more subtle encouragement. But the guest kept saying no to all the suggestions, which might justify the host's actions. \n\nI think the key points are whether the host was reasonable in their approach and if the guest's behavior warranted being asked to leave. Since the host tried multiple times and the guest didn't reciprocate, the answer might lean towards B, the host is not in the wrong. But if the host should have been more accommodating, maybe A. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nAlso, the host's coworker (his friend) is upset, which adds a layer of social obligation. The host might have considered that, but since the guest wasn't making an effort, the host's responsibility isn't to force socialization. \n\nSo, I'm leaning towards B, the author is not in the wrong. They made a good faith effort and had the right to set boundaries for the party's environment.\n"
