I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author did the right thing by kicking a guest out of the party for not socializing. Hmm.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author hosted a party, a guest came as a plus one (sort of) and started being awkward. The author tried to help by talking to him and introducing him to others, but the guest kept being alone. Then the author told him to leave, and the question is whether that's wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here. The guest was a plus one but not officially. The author made an effort twice to include him. The guest didn't take initiative to mingle or join activities after being suggested. The author got annoyed because the guest was passive and wanted others to make the effort. Then the author told him to leave.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. Well, the guest did come to a party that's supposed to be social. If he didn't want to socialize, maybe he shouldn't have attended? But maybe he's shy or socially anxious? The author tried to help, but maybe the guest had valid reasons for not engaging. However, the author is hosting their own party and has the right to set boundaries. If someone isn't making an effort and is just being a burden, the host can ask them to leave. The problem is whether the author overstepped. The guest was not disruptive, just not socializing. So maybe the author was within their rights to ask him to leave. But some might argue that the guest wasn't doing anything wrong, just being quiet. But in a social event, the expectation is to participate. So the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
