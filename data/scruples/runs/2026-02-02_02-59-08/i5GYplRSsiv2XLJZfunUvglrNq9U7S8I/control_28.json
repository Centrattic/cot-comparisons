I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a party where the host kicked out a guest because he wasn't socializing. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the guest was a plus one of a coworker but came separately. The host thought it was okay. Then, after about 20 minutes, the guest is standing around awkwardly. The host approaches him, talks to him, introduces him to someone with similar interests. They chat a bit, but then the guest is alone again. The host suggests joining a game of Uno and mingling, but the guest refuses. Finally, the host tells him to leave because he's not making an effort.\n\nSo, the key points here are the guest's behavior and the host's response. The host tried to help by introducing him and suggesting activities, but the guest didn't engage. The host got annoyed and decided to kick him out, leading to the question of whether that was wrong.\n\nFrom the host's perspective, they might feel responsible for the party's atmosphere and ensuring everyone has fun. If someone is not contributing or engaging, it could affect others. Plus, the host might feel it's reasonable to ask someone to leave if they're not respecting the social dynamics.\n\nOn the other hand, the guest might have felt uncomfortable or anxious. Maybe he's an introvert or just not good at socializing. The host's actions could come across as harsh, especially if the guest was genuinely trying but struggling. Also, the fact that the host's coworker (the guest's friend) was present might mean there was an unspoken obligation to be more tolerant.\n\nLegally and socially, hosts can set boundaries. If someone is not following the social norms of the event, the host might have the right to ask them to leave. However, if the guest's behavior was within acceptable limits (just being shy, not disruptive), the host's reaction could be seen as overly strict.\n\nThe coworker's reaction adds another layer. She called it \"shitty,\" implying that the host was too harsh. But the host explained their reasoning, which was that the guest wasn't making an effort. So, it's a balance between empathy and responsibility as a host.\n\nIn similar scenarios, people often argue that it's up to the host to create a comfortable environment, but also that guests should make an effort to participate. The line between being a responsible host and being inconsiderate can be blurry here.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the host had tried to help the guest integrate but the guest wasn't cooperating. The host's frustration is understandable, especially if the party was meant to be social. Therefore, the host might not be in the wrong for asking the guest to leave after multiple attempts to assist him.\n"
