I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a party where a guest was kicked out for not socializing.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The host had a party, invited friends and coworkers, and a guest came with a coworker. The guest was standing around awkwardly, and the host tried to help by talking to him, introducing him to someone with similar interests. The guest then stood alone again, refused to join activities, and the host told him to leave. The coworker (the friend of the guest) was upset about it.\n\nSo, the host did make an effort to include the guest. The guest, however, didn't reciprocate or make an effort to socialize despite the host's attempts. The host felt that the guest was being passive and wanted others to accommodate him without effort. The host then decided to ask him to leave because they couldn't spend all their time managing the guest's discomfort.\n\nNow, the question is whether the host was in the wrong. From a social perspective, hosts often have to manage their space and energy. If a guest is not engaging and is taking up the host's time without effort, it's reasonable to set boundaries. However, some might argue that the guest felt awkward and the host should have been more patient or accommodating.\n\nBut the host did try to help, and when the guest still refused to socialize, the host didn't want to spend more time on it. The host's party, so they have the right to ask someone to leave if they're not contributing or making others uncomfortable. The guest's behavior was passive-aggressive, expecting others to approach him but not reciprocating. So the host's action might be seen as justified.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe there's a lack of understanding of the guest's possible social anxiety or shyness. But the host isn't obligated to provide constant one-on-one attention. The answer would depend on common social norms and expectations. In many cases, guests are expected to make some effort to socialize, and if they refuse and remain unengaged, the host can set limits.\n\nSo, considering all that, the host isn't necessarily in the wrong. The answer would be B (No).\n"
