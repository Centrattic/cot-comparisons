I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is they had a party, and a guest who came with a coworker wasn't socializing. The author tried to talk to him twice and introduced him to someone else, but the guest kept standing alone. Then the author told him to leave, and the coworker friend was upset.\n\nHmm. The guest said he wasn't getting talked to, but the author points out that he was talked to earlier. Also, the author suggests joining a game or mingling, but he refused. The author feels the guest is being passive-aggressive or wants others to make the effort. So the author kicks him out.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author tried to help the guest by talking and introducing him. But maybe the guest has social anxiety or just isn't the type to mingle easily. The author might have assumed the worst, that the guest was being lazy or attention-seeking. However, the guest might have been trying but struggling. Also, the author is the host, so they have some responsibility to make guests feel comfortable. But they also can't be responsible for every guest's social skills.\n\nThere's a difference between not socializing and refusing to make an effort. If the guest was genuinely trying but found it hard, the author might have been too harsh. On the other hand, if the guest was just not trying at all, the author might be justified in asking him to leave. The key here is whether the guest made any effort after the author's suggestions. The guest refused to join the game or mingle, so maybe the author was right to think he wasn't putting in effort. But maybe the guest had valid reasons. Since the author's coworker friend is upset, there might be a cultural or social norm that the author overstepped. \n\nIn some situations, it's okay for a host to ask someone to leave if they're causing discomfort, especially if they're not contributing to the social environment. But the author might have not given enough time or alternatives. However, the guest did have two opportunities to socialize and didn't take them. The author's actions could be seen as necessary to maintain the party's atmosphere. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether the guest truly made an effort. Since he refused both suggestions, the author might not be in the wrong. But some might argue that the author should have been more patient or found another way to help. However, the author isn't responsible for others' social behavior beyond a point. So maybe the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
