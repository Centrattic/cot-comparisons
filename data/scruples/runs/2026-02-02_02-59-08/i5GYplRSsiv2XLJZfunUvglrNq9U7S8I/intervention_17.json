I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they had a party and kicked out a guest who wasn't socializing. The guest was a plus one of a coworker, but they came separately. The author tried to help him by talking to him and introducing him to someone else, but he kept standing around alone even after being given opportunities to join in.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations. When you invite someone to a party, you probably expect them to make an effort to socialize. If someone is just standing around and not engaging, maybe the host has a right to ask them to leave. But then again, some people are naturally shy or anxious, and maybe the host should be more accommodating.\n\nThe author tried to help him by talking and introducing him to another person. The guest had two chances, but he didn't take the initiative. The author got annoyed because the guest kept saying no one was talking to him despite previous interactions. The key point is whether the guest made an effort. If he didn't, maybe the host is justified in asking him to leave. But is it the host's responsibility to ensure everyone is socializing?\n\nAnother angle: the guest might have social anxiety or be uncomfortable, which isn't his fault. The host might not have handled it well by immediately asking him to leave instead of giving more time or support. However, the party is the host's space, and they can set boundaries. \n\nAlso, the coworker (the guest's plus one) might have a different perspective. The author told the coworker, and the coworker thought it was shitty. But the author explained the situation. So maybe the coworker understood.\n\nSo, balancing between the host's right to manage their event and the guest's possible social challenges. The author did make attempts to help, but the guest didn't reciprocate. The decision to ask him to leave might be seen as reasonable if the guest wasn't making an effort. However, some might argue that the host should be more patient and not kick someone out over social awkwardness. \n\nBut the problem is the guest's refusal to engage despite being offered help. If he's just being passive, the author isn't obligated to force interaction. So the author's action might be justified. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
