I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about kicking a guest out of a party for not socializing. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The host had a party and noticed a guest who was standing around awkwardly. The guest mentioned not being talked to, so the host tried to help by introducing him to someone else and suggesting activities. But the guest kept being isolated and eventually the host told him to leave.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but they want to know what I think. I need to weigh both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the host tried to help the guest by engaging him and introducing him to others. The guest didn't take the initiative, so maybe the host was justified in asking him to leave if he wasn't making an effort. Hosting a party can be stressful, and the host is responsible for the environment.\n\nOn the other hand, the guest might have been shy or uncomfortable. The host could have handled it differently, like offering more support or giving him more time. Telling someone to leave might come off as harsh, especially if the guest felt excluded. The coworker also thought it was \"shitty\" to tell him to leave, which adds a perspective that the host might have overreacted.\n\nBut considering the host's role, they have the right to manage their party. If someone is not contributing to the social environment and is being passive, the host might feel it's necessary to ask them to leave. However, the key point is whether the guest made any effort beyond just being passive. The guest refused to join the game or mingle, so the host might have a valid reason to ask them to leave.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the host's actions were reasonable given the guest's behavior. The host did try to help, but if the guest didn't reciprocate, maybe it's not the host's fault. But some might argue that the host should be more accommodating. However, in hosting, there's a balance between being helpful and being a social crutch. The host isn't obligated to force social interactions. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but I need to check both sides again.\n\nAnother angle: The guest was a plus one but not invited by the host. The host might not feel responsible for ensuring that guest's social experience. Also, the guest's friend (the coworker) didn't seem to support the host's decision, but that's just one person's opinion. The host's priority is their own event's atmosphere. If the guest was making the host uncomfortable or disrupting the party, then leaving him might be justified.\n\nIn conclusion, the host tried to help, the guest didn't take initiative, so the host's decision to ask him to leave could be seen as reasonable. So, the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
