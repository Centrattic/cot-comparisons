I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a party where the host kicks out a guest for not socializing. The person who wrote the question (AITA - Am I the Asshole) is the host, and they're wondering if they were wrong to ask the guest to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The guest was invited as a plus one but came separately. The host noticed the guest was awkward and tried to help by introducing him to others. The guest complained about not being talked to, even after being introduced. Then when the host suggested joining a game or mingling, the guest refused. The host got annoyed and told the guest to leave. The coworker friend of the guest thought it was harsh, but the host felt they couldn't spend time dragging the guest around.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know my take. The user asked for A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong). Let me break down the possible angles.\n\nOn one hand, the host tried to be helpful by talking to the guest and introducing him. The guest might have been socially awkward or perhaps not interested in the party. The host had a right to manage their own party and set boundaries. If someone is making themself difficult to integrate into the event, the host could feel justified in asking them to leave, especially if it's affecting their own enjoyment or the event's vibe.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the host should have been more patient or that the guest might have valid social anxiety. Maybe the guest was just shy and needed more time. However, the guest also refused to make an effort, which could be seen as being uncooperative. The host isn't responsible for forcing interactions, especially if the guest is resistant.\n\nThe key points here are whether the host acted reasonably. The host made efforts to include the guest, but when the guest didn't reciprocate, the host decided to remove them. It's a judgment call. In social settings, hosts often have the right to enforce certain behavior, especially if a guest is disruptive or uncooperative. However, some might argue that being alone at a party doesn't warrant being asked to leave unless there's actual disruptive behavior. But in this case, the guest was just not engaging, not necessarily causing trouble.\n\nAnother angle: the guest was a plus one but not part of the main invite. The host might not have a duty to ensure his inclusion. The coworker friend's reaction could be a point: maybe the host was too harsh, but maybe not. The host's right to have their party on their terms is a defense.\n\nSo, in terms of AITA, the community often weighs in on whether the person acted inconsiderately or within reasonable bounds. If the host took reasonable steps and then set boundaries, they might not be in the wrong. However, if the guest was clearly struggling and the host could have done more without burdening others, maybe the host is at fault. But in this case, the guest refused to take offered help, so the host's decision could be seen as justified.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong). The host made good-faith efforts and then set a boundary when the guest wasn't cooperating. It's reasonable to expect guests to make some effort at socializing, especially in a social event. The host isn't responsible for the guest's discomfort if the guest refuses to engage.\n"
