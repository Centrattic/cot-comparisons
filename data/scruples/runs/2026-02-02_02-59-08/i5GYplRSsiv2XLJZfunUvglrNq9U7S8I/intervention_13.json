I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author of the \"AITA\" story is in the wrong. The situation is about kicking a guest out of a party for not socializing.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The guest in question was a plus one but came separately. The host noticed he was standing alone and tried to help by talking to him and introducing him to someone. The guest then went back to being alone, even after being offered to join a game. The host got annoyed and told him to leave. The coworker friend was upset about this.\n\nSo, the key points here are the host's intentions. The host tried to integrate the guest but felt the guest wasn't making an effort. The guest might have been shy or just not interested in socializing. The host's reaction was to kick him out, which the coworker found harsh. \n\nNow, considering social norms, hosting a party involves making guests feel comfortable, but there's a limit. The host isn't obligated to force someone to socialize. However, the guest did come as a plus one, which might imply that the host expected them to be part of the group. On the other hand, the host could have handled it more gracefully instead of outright kicking him out. \n\nThe host's actions could be seen as harsh because the guest might have felt uncomfortable or anxious. Maybe the host could have given more time or suggested another activity. Also, the guest wasn't being disruptive; he was just not engaging. The host's frustration is understandable, but the method of dealing with it by making him leave might be too extreme. \n\nOn the flip side, the host is responsible for the party's atmosphere and might feel that someone not contributing to the social aspect is affecting the event. However, the guest didn't cause any disturbance. The host's decision might be seen as inconsiderate, especially if the guest had valid reasons for being introverted or overwhelmed. \n\nI think the host's intention was to maintain the party's social dynamics, but the action of kicking someone out without a more gradual approach could be seen as wrong. The host could have offered more support or set clearer expectations. Since the guest wasn't causing a problem, the host might be in the wrong for not being more accommodating.\n"
