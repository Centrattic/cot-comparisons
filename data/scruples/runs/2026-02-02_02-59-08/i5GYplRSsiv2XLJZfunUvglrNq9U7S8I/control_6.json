I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who kicked out the guest was wrong. The situation is a party where a guest, who was a plus one but came separately, was standing alone. The host tried to help by introducing him to someone else, but the guest kept being isolated. The host then told him to leave because he wasn't making effort to socialize.\n\nFirst, the host tried to help the guest by talking to him and introducing him to a friend. That's good. The guest, however, didn't engage after that. The host suggested joining a game or mingling, but the guest refused. The host got annoyed because the guest was creating a situation where he claimed no one was talking to him but didn't take initiative. The host's main point is that the guest wasn't putting in effort, so they had to ask him to leave.\n\nNow, the key points here are the guest's behavior versus the host's response. The host tried multiple times to help, but the guest didn't reciprocate. Parties require some level of social effort from guests. If someone is there and not making an effort, the host can't be responsible for their social interactions all the time. The host is also right that it's unreasonable to expect others to drop everything to make someone else comfortable.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the host should be more accommodating and ensure all guests feel welcome. However, there's a balance. The host has a right to manage their party and maintain a positive environment for all attendees. If someone is being a burden by not engaging and expecting others to cater to them, the host can set boundaries.\n\nIn this case, the host's actions were justified because they made a genuine attempt to integrate the guest, but when that failed, they had to enforce a boundary. The guest's behavior was likely self-centered, expecting others to solve his social issues without his participation. So the host isn't in the wrong here.\n"
