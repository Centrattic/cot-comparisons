I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a party where the host kicks out a guest for not socializing. The guest was a plus one, not officially invited, but came along with a coworker. The host noticed the guest was awkward and tried to help by introducing them to others, but the guest kept being alone and refused to participate. The host then told them to leave.\n\nFirst, the guest was a plus one but arrived separately. That might mean they weren't formally invited, so maybe the host didn't have an obligation to include them. The host did attempt to integrate the guest by talking to them and introducing them to someone with similar interests. The guest then became isolated again and refused to engage further. The host tried to get them involved in activities but they declined. The host's frustration is understandable, as hosting a party requires managing the social dynamics. \n\nThe host's main point is that the guest wasn't making an effort to socialize, just expecting others to make the first move. The host felt they couldn't spend their own time dragging the guest around. The coworker friend of the guest criticized the host for being harsh, but the host explained their reasoning. \n\nNow, is the host wrong? Well, the guest wasn't making an effort, so maybe it's reasonable to ask them to leave if they're not participating. However, the host could have handled it more gracefully, like offering to help further or giving the guest more time. But the guest was given multiple chances. The host is responsible for the event's atmosphere, so ensuring everyone feels welcome is part of that. However, the guest's behavior could be seen as passive-aggressive, expecting others to fix their social issues without effort on their part. \n\nThe line between being a good host and being reasonable is thin. The host might not be in the wrong if the guest wasn't contributing to the party's social environment. But the act of kicking someone out might be seen as harsh, even if justified. However, the guest wasn't causing harm, just not engaging. The host could have been more empathetic. \n\nOn the other hand, the host isn't obligated to force social interactions. If the guest was making others uncomfortable or being disruptive, then it's clear. But here, the issue is the guest's lack of effort. The host's frustration is valid, but the response might be seen as overly harsh. \n\nConsidering all this, there's a balance. The host tried to integrate the guest, but after multiple failures, they decided to remove the guest. Whether that's right depends on cultural norms and expectations. In some cases, it's fair to ask someone to leave if they're not engaging, especially if it's affecting the host's experience. However, the guest might not have been disruptive, just uncomfortable. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the host's actions are reasonable given the circumstances. The host isn't in the wrong because they made efforts and the guest was unresponsive. So the answer is B.\n"
