I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party because the guest wasn't socializing. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the host had a party with friends and coworkers. The guest in question was a plus one but not really a plus one, since he came separately. The host noticed him being awkward after 20 minutes. The host tried to help by talking to him, introducing him to someone with similar interests, but the guest ended up alone again. When asked why, the guest said no one was talking to him, even though he had just been. The host suggested joining a game or mingling, but he refused. The host then told him to leave if he's just going to stand around.\n\nNow, is the host in the wrong? Let's consider the host's perspective. They tried to help the guest by making introductions and offering activities. The guest, however, wasn't making an effort to socialize. The host might feel responsible for everyone's enjoyment and maybe felt that the guest was being difficult. But is it right to kick someone out for being shy or awkward?\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the guest was just introverted or uncomfortable in social settings. The host's actions might come off as judgmental. The host had the right to host the party as they saw fit, but excluding someone for not socializing could be seen as harsh. The coworker (his friend) found it shitty, which might indicate that others felt the host was too abrupt.\n\nBut the host did make attempts to help, and if the guest continued to be uncooperative, maybe the host felt justified. However, the line between helping and being inconsiderate can be thin. The host's responsibility is to their own party and the comfort of other guests. If the guest was making others uncomfortable or not following the party's vibe, it's understandable. But if it's just about not socializing, the host might have overstepped. \n\nIn similar situations, people often encourage guests to make their own connections but don't remove them unless there's a problem behavior. The guest not socializing is their choice, not a reason to be kicked out. So maybe the host is in the wrong for not being more patient and for not considering the guest's personal comfort level. The answer could be A.\n"
