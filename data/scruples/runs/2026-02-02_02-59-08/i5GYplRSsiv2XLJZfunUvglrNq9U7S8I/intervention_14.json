I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party because the guest wasn't socializing. The situation is a bit nuanced, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the host had a party with friends and coworkers. The guest in question was a plus one but arrived separately. The host noticed the guest was awkward and tried to help by introducing him to someone else. The guest then stood alone again and refused suggestions to join activities. The host got annoyed and told him to leave. The coworker (the guest's friend) thought it was shitty, but the host defended their decision.\n\nI need to consider a few points. As a host, the responsibility is to create a welcoming environment. However, the guest also has a role to engage. The host made efforts to include the guest by talking to him and introducing him. The guest's refusal to participate might indicate a lack of effort on his part. But did the host overstep? Kicking someone out for not socializing could be seen as harsh if the guest is naturally shy or has social challenges.\n\nBut the host also mentions that the guest was given multiple opportunities to engage and still chose not to. The host's time and resources are limited, and they can set boundaries. If the guest's behavior was disruptive (even if just being quiet), the host has the right to ask them to leave. However, the key point is whether the host handled it appropriately. The guest might have felt unwelcome, but the host's actions were based on the guest not making an effort. \n\nIn terms of social norms, hosts generally aren't expected to force interaction. Guests are expected to participate to some extent. If someone's presence is making the host uncomfortable or they're not contributing to the social aspect, the host can ask them to leave. The coworker's friend might feel hurt, but the host isn't necessarily wrong if they set boundaries. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the host tried to help, and the guest didn't make an effort. But there's a balance. If the guest had a valid reason for not socializing (like anxiety), maybe the host should handle it more gently. However, the story doesn't mention that. The host's actions were based on the guest's refusal to engage despite opportunities. Therefore, the host isn't in the wrong.\n"
