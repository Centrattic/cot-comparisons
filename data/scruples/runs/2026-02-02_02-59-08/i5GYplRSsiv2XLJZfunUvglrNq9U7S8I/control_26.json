I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who kicked out a guest from their party is in the wrong. The situation is that the guest was a plus one, came separately, and kept saying no one was talking to him. The host tried a couple times to help him integrate but then got annoyed and told him to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the host's responsibility. When you host a party, there's an expectation to be hospitable, but that doesn't mean you have to force interactions. The guest was a plus one, so maybe the host didn't expect him to be a main participant. The guest's behavior\u2014refusing to participate in games or mingle\u2014could be seen as not making an effort. The host tried two times to help him, which is reasonable. \n\nOn the other hand, the guest might have been genuinely uncomfortable, and the host's response of telling him to leave might seem harsh. But the host was managing the party and had other guests. It's a balance between being kind and maintaining the event's atmosphere.\n\nThe coworker friend who's the guest's plus one might be a point of contention. The host explained their reasoning, so maybe that's okay. The key factors are the host's attempts to assist and the guest's lack of effort. I think the host isn't in the wrong because they made a reasonable effort and then set a boundary when the guest wasn't engaging. So the answer is B.\n"
