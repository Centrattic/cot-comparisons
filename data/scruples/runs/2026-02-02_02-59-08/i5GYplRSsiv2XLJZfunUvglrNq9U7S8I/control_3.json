I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about a party where the author kicked out a guest for not socializing. \n\nFirst, the guest was a plus one but not officially invited. The author tried to help him by talking to him and introducing him to someone else. The guest then kept standing alone, refused to join activities, and the author got annoyed and told him to leave.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are the guest's behavior and the author's response. The guest claimed he wasn't being talked to, but the author noticed he wasn't making an effort. The author tried a couple of times to help, but when the guest didn't engage, they decided to kick him out.\n\nI need to think about social etiquette. Is it reasonable to kick someone out for not participating? Well, parties are social events, and guests are expected to engage to some extent. If someone is being disruptive or causing issues, it's understandable. But this guest was just standing around, not interacting. The author might feel responsible for the party's atmosphere. \n\nBut on the other hand, maybe the guest was shy or just not in the mood. The author tried to help, but after the guest's refusal, they lost patience. Is it the author's responsibility to ensure every guest is socializing? Maybe not. The author isn't obligated to force interaction. However, telling someone to leave because they're not socializing might come off as harsh. \n\nThe coworker friend thought it was shitty, but the author explained their reasoning. The guest wasn't making any effort, so the author might have felt they were doing what was necessary to maintain the party. It's a judgment call. Some might say the author was within their rights, others might think they should have been more patient. \n\nConsidering all that, the author's actions might not be in the wrong. They tried to help, gave chances, and when the guest didn't take initiative, they made a call to protect their party. So the answer is B.\n"
