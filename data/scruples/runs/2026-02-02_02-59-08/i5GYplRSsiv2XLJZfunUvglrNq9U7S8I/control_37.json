I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who hosted a party is in the wrong for kicking out a guest who wasn't socializing. The host invited friends and coworkers, and this guest was a plus one but came separately. The host tried to help the guest by talking to him and introducing him to someone with similar interests. The guest stood alone again, refused to join activities, and the host got annoyed. Then the host told him to leave, and the coworker (the friend of the guest) found it harsh. The host's reasoning was that the guest wasn't making an effort.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the host overstepped. The guest was a plus one but not officially invited. The host made two attempts to socialize him, but the guest didn't engage further. The host's frustration might be valid if the guest was taking up the host's time without contributing. However, kicking someone out can be seen as harsh unless there were other issues. The guest might have had a personality that made socializing difficult, but the host has a right to set boundaries at their own party. The key points are the guest's lack of initiative and the host's attempts to help. If the guest was genuinely trying, the host's reaction might be wrong. But since the guest didn't respond to the offers, the host might feel justified. The coworker's reaction is important, but the host is responsible for their own event. So, the answer could be B, but I need to check if there's a nuance I'm missing. Maybe the host should have given more time? But the guest didn't try. So B might be the right choice.\n"
