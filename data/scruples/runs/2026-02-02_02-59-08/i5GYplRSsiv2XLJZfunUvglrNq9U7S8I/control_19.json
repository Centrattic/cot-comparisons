I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party for not socializing. The story is that the guest was a plus one but didn't really fit in. The host tried to help by introducing him to others and suggesting activities, but he kept standing alone. The host got annoyed and told him to leave if he was just going to be there without interacting.\n\nHmm, so the host's perspective is that the guest wasn't making an effort and was being difficult. The guest's friend thought it was shitty for the host to tell him to leave. The key points here are the guest's behavior and the host's actions. \n\nFirst, the host did make an effort to help. They approached the guest twice, introduced him to someone with similar interests, and even suggested joining a game. The guest didn't act on these suggestions and remained isolated. The host might feel that it's not their responsibility to force social interaction, especially if the guest is an adult and should take initiative.\n\nOn the other hand, the guest might have felt anxious or shy, and the host's ultimatum could be seen as abrupt. However, since the host tried multiple times to assist and the guest didn't reciprocate, maybe the host is justified in setting boundaries. Parties can be stressful for some, but the host is also responsible for the event's atmosphere. If the guest was disruptive or uncooperative, the host has the right to ask them to leave.\n\nThe friend's reaction is interesting. She might not realize the guest's lack of effort, but the host did. The host could have handled it more gently, but the outcome was the guest left, and the host explained their reasoning. It's a bit of a gray area. The host isn't in the wrong if they felt the guest wasn't contributing to the social environment and was making themself uncomfortable. So I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
