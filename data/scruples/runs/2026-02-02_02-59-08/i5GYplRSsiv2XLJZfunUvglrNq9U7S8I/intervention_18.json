I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario (the author) is in the wrong. The situation is about hosting a party and kicking out a guest who wasn't socializing.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the details. The author hosted a party, and there was a guest who was a plus one of a coworker. The coworker and the guest came separately. The guest seemed awkward. The author tried to help by talking to him, introducing him to someone with similar interests, and suggesting activities. But the guest kept being isolated. Eventually, the author told him to leave because he wasn't making an effort. The coworker (the guest's friend) thought it was harsh, but the author defended their decision.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my take. So, I need to assess both sides. On one hand, the host is responsible for the environment and may have a right to set boundaries. The guest might have been shy or struggling socially, and the host tried to help. But if the guest is not engaging despite efforts, maybe the host is justified in asking them to leave. On the other hand, maybe the host was too quick to judge, especially since the guest might have been genuinely uncomfortable. Also, the guest could have been in a bad mood or had a low social energy that day.\n\nThe key points are whether the author overstepped by asking the guest to leave. The author tried to help multiple times, and after the guest refused to engage further, the author decided to eject them. Hosts do have the right to manage their own event, especially if someone's presence is causing issues or not aligning with the event's purpose. However, some might argue that the guest was just introverted and needed more time or encouragement. The author's approach might have been abrupt, but if the guest wasn't making an effort, maybe it's reasonable.\n\nI need to consider cultural norms and typical social expectations. In some circles, a host might feel responsible to include everyone, but if someone is actively making the host's job difficult by not trying to socialize, the host might feel justified in setting boundaries. Alternatively, maybe the host could have given more time or found a different solution. However, the fact that the guest was a plus one and not a direct invitee might play a role here. The author might feel less responsible for that guest's inclusion.\n\nAlso, the coworker's reaction is that it was \"shitty\" to kick out the guest, which might imply that some people think the host is being too strict. But the author explained their reasoning, and the coworker might not fully understand the situation. \n\nAnother angle: the guest's actions. If he kept standing alone despite being helped, maybe he wasn't interested in the party. The author's party is their space, and they can enforce their rules. So perhaps the author isn't in the wrong. The fact that they tried to help multiple times before deciding to ask him to leave shows they gave him a chance. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions might be seen as justified because they made efforts to assist the guest, and after those failed, they set boundaries. The guest's refusal to engage could be a reason for the author to ask them to leave. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
