I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

I need to determine if the answer is A or B.\n\nFirst, the situation: The host had a party, invited friends and coworkers. A guest came as a plus one but not officially. The host tried to help the guest by talking to him and introducing him to someone with similar interests. The guest then stood alone again, refused to join a game or mingle, and the host told him to leave if he wasn't going to socialize. The coworker friend thought it was bad, but the host explained they couldn't force people to interact.\n\nSo, is the host at fault? Well, the guest was clearly not making an effort. The host made attempts to help, but the guest didn't engage further. The host has the right to set boundaries for their party. If someone isn't participating and is being passive, maybe it's reasonable to ask them to leave for the sake of the event. The host also mentions they didn't have time to \"drag him around,\" which implies they were being considerate but couldn't be responsible for his entire experience. The coworker's reaction is that it was \"shitty,\" but the host had a valid reason. However, maybe the host could have handled it more politely, like suggesting he leave if he wasn't comfortable. But the core issue is the guest not trying. So the host isn't necessarily in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
