I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who kicked out a guest from their party is in the wrong. The situation is that the guest, a plus one of a coworker, seemed to be isolated. The host tried to help by introducing him to someone, but when the guest didn't engage further, the host told him to leave. The coworker thought the host was being mean.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the host had a right to expect the guest to make an effort. The guest was at a social event, so it's reasonable to expect some level of participation. The host did try to help by talking to him and introducing him to a friend, but the guest didn't take the initiative to continue the conversation or join activities. The host also offered to join a game, which the guest refused. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the guest felt anxious or uncomfortable. It's possible he was shy or not used to such environments. However, the host is responsible for managing their own party, ensuring it's enjoyable for everyone. If someone is not contributing to the social atmosphere and is making others uncomfortable, the host has the right to ask them to leave. \n\nThe key points here are the guest's lack of effort and the host's responsibility. The host tried to assist, but after repeated refusals, it's reasonable to set boundaries. The coworker's reaction might be expected, but the host isn't obligated to keep a guest who isn't participating and is causing disruption. \n\nSo, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. They made a judgment call to maintain the party's atmosphere, and it's reasonable to expect guests to make an effort to socialize.\n"
