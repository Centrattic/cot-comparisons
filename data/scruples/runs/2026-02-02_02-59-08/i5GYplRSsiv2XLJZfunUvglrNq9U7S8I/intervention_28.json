I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

The host tried to help him socialize twice, but the guest didn't take the initiative. Then the host told him to leave.\n\nHmm. The host's perspective is that the guest was being passive, not making an effort to talk to others, and just wanted attention. The guest kept saying no one was talking to him even after being introduced. The host got annoyed and told him to leave.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the host could have handled it more gently. But the guest was given chances to engage. The host is responsible for their own party and their own time. If guests don't contribute to the social environment, it's reasonable to ask them to leave. But some might argue that the host should be more accommodating. However, the key points are that the guest didn't make an effort, the host tried to help, and the host felt it was affecting the party atmosphere. \n\nI think the host isn't in the wrong because they set boundaries. The guest's responsibility is to engage if they want to participate. So answer B.\n"
