I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who hosted the party was wrong to kick out a guest who wasn't socializing. The situation is that the guest was invited by a coworker, came separately, and kept standing alone. The host tried to help by talking to him and introducing him to someone else, but he ended up isolating again. When the host suggested joining activities, he refused, leading the host to tell him to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the host's responsibility. They had a party, invited people, and provided food and drinks. They made an effort to include the guest initially. The guest, on the other hand, didn't take initiative after being introduced. The host might feel that their time is limited and can't cater to everyone's social needs. But maybe the guest was genuinely shy or uncomfortable, and the host's actions were too abrupt. \n\nThe coworker friend (the guest's plus one) thought it was shitty, implying that maybe the host was too harsh. However, the host might believe that if someone isn't making an effort, the host isn't obligated to intervene further. \n\nIt's a balance between being a good host and respecting the guest's autonomy. The host did try twice to help, but the guest didn't respond. If the guest is unwilling to engage despite opportunities, the host isn't necessarily wrong for setting a boundary. However, some might argue that the host should be more accommodating. \n\nBut considering that the host is also responsible for the event and other guests, it's reasonable to expect attendees to contribute to a social environment. If someone is disruptive or not participating, removing them isn't out of line. The key here is whether the host acted unreasonably. Since the guest didn't take initiative after being assisted, the host's decision might be justified. So the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
