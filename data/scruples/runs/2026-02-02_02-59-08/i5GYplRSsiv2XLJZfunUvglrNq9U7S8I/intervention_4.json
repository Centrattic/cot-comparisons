I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who hosted a party is in the wrong for kicking out a guest who wasn't socializing. Let me break down the situation.\n\nSo, the host had a party and noticed a guest who was a plus one but came separately. The guest seemed awkward, and the host tried to help by introducing him to someone with similar interests. The guest then went back to being alone, even after the host suggested joining a game or mingling. Eventually, the host told him to leave. The host is now wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the host's responsibility. Hosting a party usually involves providing a welcoming environment, but it's not their job to force guests to socialize. The guest in question was given multiple chances to engage\u2014talked to by the host, introduced to someone else, and offered to join a game. When the guest refused each time, maybe the host felt their effort was wasted.\n\nBut the guest's perspective is also important. He might have been shy or socially anxious. The host might have thought they were being helpful, but kicking someone out could seem harsh. However, the host is also in charge of their event's atmosphere. If someone is not participating and is being a passive burden, the host has the right to set boundaries.\n\nThe host did try to help, but after repeated refusals, they decided to remove the guest. The key here is whether the host was obligated to continue accommodating the guest. Since the guest wasn't making an effort, maybe the host isn't at fault. On the flip side, the host could have offered more alternatives or given more time, but they did attempt to assist multiple times.\n\nThe coworker friend's reaction might be a red flag. If the host's explanation was reasonable, why did the friend find it shitty? Maybe the host's tone or the way it was delivered. However, the host's main point is about the guest's lack of effort.\n\nIn social situations, hosts have the right to manage their event. If a guest is not engaging and is not contributing to the positive vibe, removing them isn't necessarily wrong. The host isn't responsible for every guest's social success, especially when the guest isn't trying. So, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong), but there's a nuance here. The host could have handled it more gracefully, but the action itself might be justified.\n"
