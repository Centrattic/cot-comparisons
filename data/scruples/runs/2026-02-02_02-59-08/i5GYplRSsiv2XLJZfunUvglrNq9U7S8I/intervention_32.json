I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party for not socializing. The answer options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation from both sides. The host had a party and invited friends and coworkers. A guest came with a coworker but was a plus one, not formally invited. The guest seemed awkward and claimed no one was talking to him. The host tried to help by introducing him to someone with similar interests, but the guest ended up being alone again. The host suggested joining a game and mingling, but the guest refused. The host then told him to leave, and the coworker was upset about it.\n\nNow, considering the host's perspective: They were trying to be hospitable, made efforts to include the guest, but when the guest wasn't engaging despite multiple opportunities, the host got annoyed and asked him to leave. The host might feel that they did their part and the guest wasn't making an effort.\n\nFrom the guest's side: He might feel he was left out, maybe the other guests weren't being friendly, or he's just shy or uncomfortable in social settings. But he did ask for help twice. The host did try to help both times. The guest's refusal to engage after being introduced could be seen as not taking initiative, though maybe there's a social anxiety angle here.\n\nThe coworker (the guest's plus one) is upset, thinking it was harsh. The host's reasoning is that they can't be responsible for dragging the guest around. Are parties expected to have everyone socializing? Or is it okay to have people who just attend without mingling? \n\nThe host isn't obligated to force interactions, but telling someone to leave because they aren't socializing might be overstepping. The guest was there, not causing disruption, just not engaging. Maybe the host could have handled it more gently, like suggesting he enjoy the food or drinks instead of making him leave. The act of kicking out a guest for not socializing could be seen as harsh, especially if the guest was genuinely trying to fit in but struggled. \n\nOn the other hand, the host is in their own home and can set boundaries. If the guest was being a burden or causing discomfort to others, it might be justified. But in this case, the host's frustration seems more about the guest's lack of effort rather than any negative behavior. \n\nSo, is the host in the wrong? It's a bit of a judgment call. The host tried to help, but forcing someone to leave for not socializing might not be fair. The answer could be A (in the wrong) because the host didn't give the guest enough time or alternative options, or B (not in the wrong) because the host has the right to manage their party. I think leaning towards A because the guest wasn't disruptive, just awkward, and the host could have handled it without expulsion. But maybe others would say B because the host is entitled to their space.\n"
