I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about kicking a guest out of their party because the guest wasn't socializing. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the host had a party with friends and coworkers. A guest came as a plus one, but maybe not officially. The guest was standing around looking awkward. The host tried to help by talking to him and introducing him to someone with similar interests. The guest then stood alone again, even though he was talked to before. The host suggested joining a game and mingling, but the guest refused. The host got annoyed, thinking the guest was just looking for attention, and told him to leave. The coworker (his friend) thought it was bad to tell him to leave, but the host explained it wasn't their job to drag him into conversations.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the host's perspective. They made an effort to help the guest by engaging and introducing him. The guest, however, didn't make an effort to socialize further after the host tried. The host might feel responsible for the party's atmosphere and not wanting to accommodate someone who's not contributing or trying. But on the other hand, some might argue that it's not the host's job to force social interactions, and telling someone to leave could be harsh, even if the guest wasn't proactive.\n\nHowever, the host did attempt to assist multiple times. The guest's refusal to engage after being helped might justify the host's decision. The host isn't obligated to baby-sit someone who's not making an effort. The coworker's friend might be in a bad position, but the host had the right to set boundaries for their own party. So, the author is probably not in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
