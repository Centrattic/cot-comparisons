I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party because the guest didn't socialize. The situation is from a Reddit-style \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenario.\n\nFirst, the author had a party and noticed a guest who was being awkward. They tried to help by talking to him and introducing him to someone else. The guest then went back to being alone and refused to join activities. The author got annoyed and told the guest to leave. The coworker friend (the original invitee's plus one) was upset about this.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants confirmation. So I need to evaluate if the author's actions were justified.\n\nKey points: The guest was invited as a plus one but arrived separately. The author made efforts to integrate him, but the guest wasn't taking initiative. The author felt it was the guest's own fault for not socializing and decided to remove him. The coworker friend was upset with the author.\n\nLegally and socially, can you kick someone out of your party? Yes, because it's the host's space. However, the question is about being \"in the wrong\" in terms of social norms.\n\nFactors to consider: Did the author give enough opportunity for the guest to socialize? Yes, they tried a couple of times. Did the guest make any effort after being helped? No, he refused to engage. Did the author handle it politely? The author said \"if you're just going to stand around, you can leave,\" which might come off as abrupt, but it's still within the host's rights.\n\nSocially, people might have different opinions. Some might say the author was within their rights, while others might think it's harsh. The coworker friend's reaction adds another layer, maybe implying that the author was too quick to judge. But the guest's behavior (not trying to socialize despite being offered help) could justify the author's decision.\n\nIn \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenarios, the community often considers both sides. The author did try to help, but the guest's refusal to participate might make the author justified. However, the approach of telling someone to leave could be seen as harsh. But since it's the host's party, they have the right to set boundaries.\n\nSo the answer hinges on whether the author's action was an overreaction. Given the guest's lack of effort, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But some might argue that it's rude. However, the host's authority is a factor here. I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
