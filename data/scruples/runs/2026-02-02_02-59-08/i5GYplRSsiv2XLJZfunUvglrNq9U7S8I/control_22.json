I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party because the guest wasn't socializing. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the details. The guest was a plus one of a coworker, not officially invited. The host noticed him standing alone and tried to help by introducing him to someone with similar interests. When that didn't work, the host suggested joining a game and mingling, but the guest refused. The host then told him to leave, thinking he wasn't making an effort.\n\nNow, the key points here: Did the host handle it fairly? The guest claimed he wasn't being talked to, but the host saw him being talked to earlier. The guest's actions might have been passive, expecting others to approach him. The host tried multiple times to help but then decided to remove him. \n\nOn one hand, the host is responsible for managing their party and ensuring it's enjoyable for everyone. If a guest is not contributing to the social environment and is making others uncomfortable by being a wallflower, the host has the right to ask them to leave. On the other hand, maybe the guest was genuinely shy or had social anxiety, and the host could have tried a different approach. But the guest refused all offers to engage. \n\nThe host also let the coworker know, explaining the situation. The coworker didn't agree, but the host felt justified. The question is about whether the host was in the wrong. Considering that the host made multiple attempts to include the guest and the guest repeatedly refused to engage, it might be reasonable for the host to remove them. The host isn't responsible for making the guest socialize if the guest isn't putting in effort. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But maybe there's a nuance I'm missing, like the guest had a valid reason for being awkward. However, the host can't be expected to read minds. The guest's behavior was not cooperative. So I think the host is justified.\n"
