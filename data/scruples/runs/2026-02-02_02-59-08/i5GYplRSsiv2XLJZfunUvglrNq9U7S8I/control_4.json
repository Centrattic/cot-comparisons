I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for kicking out a guest who wasn't socializing. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the host had a party with friends and coworkers. A guest came as a plus one but maybe wasn't expected. The host noticed the guest was awkward, tried to help by talking to him and introducing him to someone else. The guest then stood alone again, refused to join activities. The host got annoyed, told him to leave. The coworker friend was upset about that.\n\nSo, the host's actions: they tried to help the guest by engaging and introducing. The guest didn't take initiative after that. The host decided he wasn't making an effort and asked him to leave. The host's reasoning was that they couldn't spend time dragging him around.\n\nNow, considering social norms. Parties are social events, and guests are expected to participate to some extent. If someone is there but not making an effort to mingle, maybe the host is within their rights to manage the event. However, maybe there's a more polite way to handle it. But the host did try to help first. The guest might have had social anxiety or other issues, but the host can't be responsible for everyone's comfort all the time. \n\nThe key points: Did the host give enough support? Yes, they talked to him, introduced him, suggested activities. The guest didn't engage further. The host's decision might be seen as enforcing social participation, which is reasonable. The coworker friend's reaction might be harsh, but the host's actions were to maintain the party's atmosphere. \n\nSo, the host isn't necessarily in the wrong. They tried to help, and when the guest didn't reciprocate, they set a boundary. Maybe some would argue it's harsh, but the host has the right to manage their event. So answer B.\n"
