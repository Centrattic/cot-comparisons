I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party. The guest in question was the friend of a coworker, not an official plus-one. The host noticed the guest was isolated and tried to help by talking to him and introducing him to others. Despite these efforts, the guest kept retreating to solitude and refused to engage in activities. The host then told him to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the host's responsibility. Hosting a party involves managing the environment so that all guests can enjoy themselves. When a guest is causing discomfort or not contributing positively, the host has a right to address the situation. The host here made multiple attempts to integrate the guest into the party, showing effort to help him feel included. \n\nThe guest's behavior, however, seems to be the root of the issue. He repeatedly claimed not to be spoken to, even after interactions had occurred. When given opportunities to participate (like joining a game), he refused. This could indicate that the guest was not making an effort to engage, possibly expecting others to accommodate him. \n\nThe host's decision to ask the guest to leave might be justified because the guest's behavior was not reciprocal. The host wasn't obligated to constantly intervene to keep him engaged. It's reasonable to expect all guests to make an effort to socialize, especially when the host has already facilitated introductions. \n\nAdditionally, the host communicated the situation to the guest's friend (the coworker), which shows they took responsibility for their actions and were transparent. The coworker's initial reaction was negative, but the host explained their reasoning. \n\nPossible counterarguments might be that the host could have handled it more gracefully or that the guest might have social anxiety. However, the scenario doesn't mention any prior awareness of such issues. The host acted based on the guest's responses and the situation at the party. \n\nIn conclusion, the host's actions were a response to the guest's refusal to engage despite efforts to include him. The host isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries to maintain the party's atmosphere. The correct answer is B.\n"
