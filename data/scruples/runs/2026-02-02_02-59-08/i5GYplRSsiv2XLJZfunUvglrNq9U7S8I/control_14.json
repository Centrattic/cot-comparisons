I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who kicked the guest out was in the wrong. The situation is a party where a guest was being awkward and not socializing. The host tried to help by introducing them to someone else and suggested joining a game, but the guest refused both times. Then the host told them to leave.\n\nFirst, consider the host's perspective. They had the right to have the party in their home and set boundaries. The guest was invited, possibly as a plus one, but maybe not explicitly. The host made efforts to include the guest, so it's not like they were ignored. The guest kept isolating themselves, which could be seen as not making an effort. The host's frustration is understandable, especially if they had limited time and energy. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that making someone leave a party could be harsh, especially if the guest was genuinely shy. However, the guest was given multiple chances to engage and refused. The host isn't responsible for forcing social interactions. The key points are the guest's lack of effort and the host's attempts to help. So the host might not be in the wrong here. The answer is B.\n"
