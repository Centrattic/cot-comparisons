I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for kicking out a guest who wasn't socializing at their party.\n\nFirst, the setup: the guest was a plus one but not officially invited. The host noticed the guest was alone and tried to help by introducing them to someone. The guest then became isolated again, refused to join activities, and the host eventually told them to leave. The coworker friend of the guest got upset about this.\n\nI need to consider the responsibilities of a host and guest behavior. As a host, it's reasonable to expect guests to make some effort to socialize, especially in a group setting. The guest in question didn't engage, rejected suggestions to join in, and seemed to want others to make the effort. The host tried to assist multiple times, which shows they were trying to be accommodating.\n\nHowever, there's a line between being a good host and overstepping. Kicking someone out for not socializing could be seen as harsh, but the host did attempt to integrate the guest. The guest's own actions (refusing to participate) might justify the host's decision. The key point is whether the host gave adequate opportunities for the guest to engage. Since they did, and the guest still didn't make an effort, the host's action might be reasonable.\n\nAlso, the guest's friend (the coworker) is upset, which complicates things. The host had to balance their own event management with the feelings of their coworker. But the host's primary responsibility is to their own event. The guest's behavior was passive and not contributing, so the host's response could be justified as maintaining the party's environment.\n\nIn conclusion, the host isn't necessarily in the wrong because they made efforts to include the guest and the guest didn't reciprocate. The decision to ask them to leave is a reasonable boundary when the guest isn't engaging despite help.\n"
