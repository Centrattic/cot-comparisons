I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party for not socializing. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants another opinion. \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author had a party where a guest was invited by a coworker. The guest was standing around alone, and the author tried to help by talking to him and introducing him to someone else. But the guest kept saying no one was talking to him even after being introduced. Then the guest refused to join a game or mingle, leading the author to tell him to leave.\n\nNow, the key points here are: was the guest actually being rude or uncooperative? The author tried to help, but the guest didn't reciprocate the effort. The author might feel that their time is limited and they can't cater to everyone's needs. On the other hand, kicking someone out could be seen as harsh, even if the guest wasn't engaging.\n\nBut the guest's perspective is important too. Maybe he was genuinely shy or had social anxiety, making it hard for him to approach others. The author's response to someone not socializing might be too quick. However, the guest did have opportunities to interact but didn't take them. The author might not be responsible for the guest's discomfort beyond a certain point.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the author tried to assist, but when the guest didn't make an effort, the author decided to end the situation. It's a judgment call. Some might say the author acted unfairly, while others might agree that it's reasonable not to force social interactions. But given that the guest was a plus one, maybe the author's tolerance is lower. However, the author's action of telling someone to leave could be seen as overly harsh. But if the guest was a burden, maybe not. I think the answer here is B, the author is not in the wrong because they made an effort to help and then set a boundary when the guest wasn't reciprocating.\n"
