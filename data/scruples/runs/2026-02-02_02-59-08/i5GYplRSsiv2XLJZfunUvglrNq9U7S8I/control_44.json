I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (AITA) is in the wrong for kicking out a guest who wasn't socializing.\n\nFirst, context: The host had a party, invited friends and coworkers. A guest came as a plus one but not officially. The host noticed the guest was standing around, approached him twice, introduced him to someone, but he kept isolating himself. The host got annoyed, told him to leave if he's just going to stand there. The coworker (his friend) thought it was harsh, but the host justified it by saying the guest didn't make effort.\n\nSo, is the host in the wrong? Well, hosting a party involves setting the tone. People have different social comfort levels. The guest might have been shy or anxious. The host did try to include him twice. But maybe the host could have been more patient or given more opportunities. However, the guest refused to engage even when given options. The host's responsibility isn't to force socialization, especially in a party setting where people come for fun. The host isn't obligated to make every guest comfortable, especially if the guest isn't making effort. The host might have the right to ask someone to leave if they're not participating and it's affecting the event. So, probably not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
