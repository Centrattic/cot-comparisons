I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party for not socializing.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The host had a party, a guest came as a plus one but not officially. The guest was standing alone, and the host tried to help by talking to him, introducing him to others, suggesting activities. The guest kept saying he wasn't being talked to, even after interactions. The host got annoyed and told him to leave. The coworker friend of the host thought it was harsh.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the host made multiple efforts to include the guest. The guest, despite being offered help, refused to engage further. The host's party was for socializing, so expecting guests to participate makes sense. The guest's behavior might be passive-aggressive or expecting others to make the effort entirely.\n\nBut is the host wrong? Well, the guest was a plus one, not an official invitee. The host isn't obligated to ensure every guest is happy, especially if they don't make an effort. However, kicking someone out for not socializing could be seen as harsh. But considering the host tried multiple times and the guest was uncooperative, maybe it's justified. Also, the host is responsible for the atmosphere of their own party. If someone is making others uncomfortable or not following the social norms, removing them might be reasonable.\n\nThe coworker friend is upset, but the host explained their reasoning. The main question is whether it's fair to expect guests to socialize. Not everyone is a social butterfly, but if someone is clearly not making an effort despite help, the host might not be in the wrong. So leaning towards B, the host isn't in the wrong.\n"
