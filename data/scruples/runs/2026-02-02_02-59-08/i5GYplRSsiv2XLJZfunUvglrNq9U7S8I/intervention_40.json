I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party for not socializing. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but is curious about my opinion. I need to decide between A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong).\n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The author had a party, invited friends and coworkers. A guest came as a plus one but not officially. He was there with a coworker, but they arrived separately. The author noticed the guest was awkward, asked him twice if everything was okay, and tried to introduce him to someone. The guest then stood alone again, refused to join activities, and the author told him to leave if he was just going to be there alone. The guest left, and the author's coworker (the plus one's friend) was upset, but the author defended themselves by saying the guest didn't make an effort. The user is leaning towards A but wants confirmation.\n\nNow, to analyze. Host responsibilities: A host can set expectations for guests' behavior. If someone is being a burden or not following the social norms, the host has the right to ask them to leave. However, the approach matters. The author did try to help by talking to him, introducing him, suggesting activities. But the guest didn't engage. The author's frustration is understandable if they're managing the party and trying to keep everyone comfortable. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, even if the guest wasn't socializing, the host should handle it politely. Telling someone to leave because they're not socializing enough could be seen as harsh unless the guest was disruptive. The guest didn't do anything inappropriate, just didn't engage. Maybe the author overstepped by making the guest leave. On the other hand, the guest might have felt uncomfortable, but that's different from the host being at fault. The coworker's reaction might be part of the issue\u2014maybe the author should have handled it more privately or with more sensitivity. \n\nAnother angle: The guest was a plus one who came separately. If the author allowed that, the guest isn't a total outsider. The author's approach could be considered rude, but if they were managing the party and the guest was making others uncomfortable by being passive, maybe it's justified. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nI think the key points are that the host made an effort to include the guest, but when the guest didn't reciprocate, the host decided to remove them. Since the guest wasn't being hostile or disruptive, just not engaging, the host might have handled it better by offering to help again or setting the guest up with others. However, the host isn't necessarily in the wrong because they have the right to ask someone to leave if they feel the person isn't contributing positively. The answer here might be B, not in the wrong, because the host tried to include the guest and had the right to set boundaries. But others might say the host should have been more patient. Hmm.\n"
