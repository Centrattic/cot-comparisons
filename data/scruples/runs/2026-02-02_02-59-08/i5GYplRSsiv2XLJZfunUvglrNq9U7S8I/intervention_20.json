I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party for not socializing. The scenario is from an AITA (Am I the Asshole) thread.\n\nSo, the host had a party, invited friends and coworkers. A guest came with a coworker, but they arrived separately. The host noticed the guest was awkward and tried to help by talking to him, introducing him to someone with similar interests. The guest then stood alone again, refused suggestions to join a game or mingle. The host got annoyed, told him to leave. The coworker friend was upset, but the host argued that the guest wasn't making an effort.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. The question is whether the answer is A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The host made an effort to help the guest socialize. The guest, however, seems to be resistant. The host's party is their space, so they have some control over the environment. However, the line is whether it's reasonable to kick someone out for not socializing. \n\nBut the guest might have different social needs or anxiety. Maybe he was just shy or uncomfortable. The host tried twice to help, and the guest didn't engage. The host's frustration is understandable, but kicking someone out for not being social might be harsh. \n\nThe host could have other options, like giving space or suggesting a game again. However, the host is responsible for the party's atmosphere. If someone is making them uncomfortable with their behavior, it's their right to ask them to leave. \n\nBut the key point is whether the host acted unreasonably. The guest was a plus one, not explicitly invited by the host. The host might have expected guests to participate. However, socializing isn't mandatory. If someone is awkward, the host can't force them to socialize. \n\nIn some cases, people might feel nervous or introverted. The host might have overreacted. Alternatively, the guest wasn't making any effort, so the host is within their rights to ask them to leave. \n\nThe host's justification is that they were busy and couldn't be a social director. The guest's actions might be seen as not respecting the host's effort. \n\nIn terms of social norms, it's generally expected that guests make an effort to socialize at parties. If someone is completely unengaged and refuses all help, the host might feel justified in asking them to leave. \n\nBut another angle is that the host should be more accommodating. However, the host is not obligated to ensure every guest is having fun. The line is where responsibility lies. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the host is within their rights to manage their party's atmosphere, especially if a guest is not contributing and is passive. The guest might be at fault for not making an effort. However, some might argue that the host should have been more patient or understanding. But given the context, the host's actions could be seen as reasonable.\n"
