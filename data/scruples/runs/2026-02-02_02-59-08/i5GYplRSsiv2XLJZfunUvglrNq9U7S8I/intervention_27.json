I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for kicking out a guest who wasn't socializing. The situation is that the guest, a plus one, felt ignored and was asked to leave because he didn't make an effort to mingle.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms here. Hosts do have the responsibility to manage their parties, but guests also have a role to play in social interactions. The guest in question was a plus one but maybe not explicitly invited. The host tried to help by introducing him to a friend and suggesting activities, but the guest kept withdrawing.\n\nThe host's reasoning is that the guest wasn't making an effort, so the host told him to leave. The host's coworker (the friend of the guest) thought it was harsh, but the host defended their decision. Now, the user initially thought the author was in the wrong but wants to know if that's the case.\n\nI should think about whether the host overstepped. Did the guest have a right to be there? If the guest was invited through a friend, maybe the host didn't have the authority to kick him out. Also, was the guest truly being ignored, or was he not trying hard enough? The host tried to intervene twice, but maybe that's not enough. Alternatively, maybe the host was within their rights to ask him to leave if they felt it was affecting the party.\n\nAnother angle: sometimes people are shy or anxious at parties. The guest might have had social anxiety, making it hard to interact even though he wanted to join. The host's approach might have been too abrupt. However, the guest did refuse the suggestions, which might indicate he wasn't interested in participating.\n\nIn terms of social etiquette, it's generally polite to make an effort to socialize at a party. If someone is not engaging and is a burden to the host, the host can politely ask them to leave. However, the method of handling it could matter. The host did try to include the guest, so maybe it's justified. On the other hand, the guest might have needed more support, and the host's frustration led to a hasty decision.\n\nI think the key points are whether the guest was given enough chances and whether the host handled it appropriately. The host tried twice, and the guest didn't take initiative. So, the host might not be in the wrong. But there's a nuance here. The answer could be either way, but leaning towards the host not being in the wrong because the guest didn't make an effort. The host isn't responsible for making every guest comfortable if they don't reciprocate.\n"
