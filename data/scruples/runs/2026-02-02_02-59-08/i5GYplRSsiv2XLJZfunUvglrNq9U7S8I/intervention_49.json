I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party for not socializing. The author had a party, noticed a guest was being awkward and not engaging, tried to help by introducing him to others, but he kept isolating himself. Eventually, the author told him to leave because he wasn't making an effort. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants a second opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The guest was a plus one but not officially invited. The author tried to help him integrate by talking to him and introducing him to others. The guest then went back to being alone, even when given opportunities to join activities. The author got annoyed because the guest was passive, not making an effort, and eventually asked him to leave. The coworker (his friend) was upset, but the author stood by their decision.\n\nNow, to evaluate if the author was in the wrong. On one hand, the author tried to help the guest, which is thoughtful. But once the guest didn't respond to those efforts, the author might feel they can't spend all their time managing someone else's social anxiety. However, kicking someone out for not socializing could be seen as harsh. The guest might have had social difficulties and wasn't at fault for being awkward. The author's party is their space, but is it reasonable to ask someone to leave for not engaging enough?\n\nPossible angles: The author's right to their space vs. the guest's social situation. The guest was a plus one, which might not have the same expectations. The author tried to help, but maybe giving up was too quick. Alternatively, the author isn't obligated to force socialization. Also, the coworker's reaction suggests that the author's action might have been socially expected to be more forgiving.\n\nBut in the end, the author is the host and has the right to set boundaries. If someone is not making an effort to participate and is being a burden, the host isn't wrong to ask them to leave. The guest's responsibility is to try to engage, not just wait for others. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
