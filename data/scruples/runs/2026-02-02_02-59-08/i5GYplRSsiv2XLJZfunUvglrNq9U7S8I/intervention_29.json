I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about kicking out a guest who wasn't socializing.\n\nFirst, the host had a party with friends and coworkers. A guest came along with a coworker but wasn't really a plus one. The host noticed the guest was awkward and tried to help by talking to him and introducing him to someone else. But after that, the guest kept being alone again and refused suggestions to join activities. The host then told him to leave because he wasn't making an effort.\n\nNow, considering the host's perspective: they were trying to help, but after multiple attempts, the guest still wasn't engaging. The host felt it was their responsibility to manage the party and ensure others were comfortable. They didn't want to spend time dragging the guest around, which is understandable.\n\nOn the other hand, the guest might have felt anxious or out of place. Maybe he wasn't comfortable approaching people on his own. The host's approach might have been abrupt, especially if the guest was already feeling excluded. However, the host did make efforts to include him and gave him chances. If the guest continued to isolate himself, maybe the host had a right to ask him to leave to maintain the party's atmosphere.\n\nThe coworker friend who defended the guest might have thought the host was too harsh, but the host's explanation about the guest not making an effort is valid. It's a balance between being hospitable and respecting the event's dynamics. The host isn't obligated to force interactions. So, I think the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
