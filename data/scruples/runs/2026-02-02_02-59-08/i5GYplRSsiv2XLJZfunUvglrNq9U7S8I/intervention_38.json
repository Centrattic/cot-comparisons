I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this AITA scenario. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party because the guest wasn't socializing.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The host had a party with friends and coworkers. The guest in question was a plus one but didn't come with the coworker. Early on, the guest seems awkward and mentions no one is talking to him. The host tries to help by talking to him, introducing him to someone with similar interests, suggesting a game. The guest then goes back to standing alone, again says no one is talking to him, and refuses to mingle or join the game. The host gets annoyed and tells him to leave if he's just going to stand around. The coworker friend is upset about it, but the host explains they couldn't baby-sit the guest.\n\nSo, the key points are: The host made efforts to include the guest, but the guest didn't reciprocate. The host felt it was the guest's own issue and didn't want to keep trying to force interaction. The question is whether the host was wrong to ask him to leave.\n\nNow, I need to think about social norms and host responsibilities. Typically, a host isn't obligated to ensure every guest is entertained or to actively facilitate all interactions beyond the initial invitations. The guest was an invitee of a coworker, so maybe the host isn't fully responsible for his experience. However, the guest was a plus one, which sometimes can be a bit ambiguous. \n\nThe host did make an effort by talking to him and introducing him to someone. The guest's refusal to join in or approach others might be seen as passive, not trying to engage. The host's annoyance is understandable because they didn't want to be the sole person responsible for his inclusion. Kicking someone out for not socializing can seem harsh, but if the guest is not participating and is being a burden, maybe the host had a valid point.\n\nI should consider if there's any underlying issue. Maybe the guest is introverted or uncomfortable in social settings. The host might have overstepped by telling him to leave. But the guest also didn't make an effort, so the host's explanation about not having time to drag him around is a defense.\n\nIn the AITA format, the community often looks at both sides. The host isn't wrong for setting boundaries, especially if the guest was being uncooperative after multiple attempts to help. But the coworker's reaction (calling it shitty) might indicate that the host was a bit too abrupt. However, the guest's behavior was his own choice, and the host isn't obligated to force interactions.\n\nSo, the answer might hinge on whether the host's actions were appropriate given the guest's lack of effort. Since the host tried a few times and the guest didn't reciprocate, maybe the host isn't in the wrong. But I need to check if being a plus one gives the host less responsibility. Plus ones usually come with the main guest, so the host might not be responsible for ensuring they have a good time. The coworker invited the friend, so maybe that's where the responsibility lies.\n\nUltimately, the host's actions could be seen as reasonable. They made an effort, the guest didn't engage, and the host decided to set a boundary. However, some might argue that it's not the host's role to police social interactions. But given the context, the host's explanation that they couldn't take time to keep dragging the guest around might justify their decision. The answer might be B, not in the wrong, but I need to be careful. If the guest was uncomfortable and the host didn't do enough to help, maybe A. But the host did try, so B seems plausible.\n"
