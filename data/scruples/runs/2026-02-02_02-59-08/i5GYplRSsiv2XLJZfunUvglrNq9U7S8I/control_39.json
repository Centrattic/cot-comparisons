I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party for not socializing. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the host had a party with friends and coworkers. The guest in question was a plus one, but they arrived separately. The host noticed him standing around awkwardly. He told the host that no one was talking to him. The host tried to help by introducing him to someone with similar interests. They talked briefly, but then he was alone again. The host asked again, and the guest repeated the same issue. The host suggested joining a game or mingling, but he refused. The host then told him to leave if he wasn't going to socialize. The coworker (his friend) thought it was harsh, but the host defended their decision.\n\nHmm. So, the main question is whether the host was wrong to ask him to leave. Let's consider the host's perspective. They were hosting a party, which requires managing the environment. If a guest is not making an effort to socialize and is instead expecting others to come to them, it could be frustrating. The host did try to help by introducing him and suggesting activities. However, the guest didn't take initiative after that. The host felt it was their responsibility to maintain the party's atmosphere and not let someone who isn't contributing to the social aspect stay. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the guest was genuinely shy or introverted. The host might have overstepped by demanding he leave. Maybe there's a lack of understanding of social anxiety. The host could have given more time or found another way to help. But the guest's refusal to engage despite suggestions might indicate that he wasn't interested in the party's purpose. \n\nAlso, the guest's friend (the coworker) thought it was harsh. But the host explained their reasoning. The host's responsibility is to their own event. If a guest is just standing around and not participating, it might disrupt the vibe. It's possible the host is not in the wrong because they tried to assist and set boundaries when efforts failed. The guest had the choice to leave on his own but was asked when it became an issue. \n\nI think the answer is B (No). The host isn't in the wrong because they made an effort to help, and after repeated refusals, they had the right to enforce the party's social environment. The guest was responsible for his own actions and could have left without being asked if he wasn't comfortable. The host's actions were within their right to manage their own event.\n"
