I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The host had a party and a guest was being left out. The host tried to help by talking to him and introducing him to someone else, but the guest kept standing alone. The host got annoyed because the guest seemed to want others to make an effort for him. Then the host told him to leave, and the guest went. The coworker friend was upset, but the host felt it was justified.\n\nFirst, the host is responsible for managing the party. If someone is struggling to socialize, it's reasonable to try to integrate them. The host did try a couple of times\u2014talking to him, introducing him, suggesting activities. But after multiple attempts, the guest still didn't engage. The host might have felt that the guest wasn't making an effort, which is understandable. \n\nHowever, kicking someone out can be seen as harsh. Social events can be stressful, and some people might need more encouragement. The host's frustration is valid, but maybe there were other options, like pairing him with another guest or giving him a task. \n\nOn the other hand, the host also has the right to set boundaries. If the guest is not contributing to the social environment and is being a burden, removing him could be seen as necessary for the comfort of other guests. The key point is whether the host acted out of genuine concern versus impatience. Since the host tried to help and the guest refused to participate, the host's actions might be justified. The answer might lean towards B, but there's nuance. The host might be in the right because they made efforts first, and the guest didn't reciprocate. So the answer is B.\n"
