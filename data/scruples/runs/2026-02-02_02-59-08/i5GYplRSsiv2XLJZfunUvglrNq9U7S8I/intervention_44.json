I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong. So, the situation is a party where a guest was kicked out for not socializing. The guest was brought by a coworker but not as a plus one. The author tried to help by talking to him and introducing him to someone else, but the guest kept being alone. The author got annoyed and told him to leave.\n\nFirst, the guest's perspective: he felt ignored and was uncomfortable. He might have been shy or just not in the mood. But he did reach out for help twice. The author tried to help, but maybe not enough? Or maybe the guest didn't want help in the way offered?\n\nThe author's actions: They engaged the guest, introduced him to someone, suggested joining a game. When the guest didn't take those steps, the author told him to leave. The coworker (his friend) thought it was harsh. The key here is whether the author had the right to kick someone out for not socializing. \n\nParties are social events, but people have different comfort levels. If the guest was there by a friend's invitation, maybe he expected some social interaction but didn't have to force himself to interact. The author is the host, but is it their responsibility to ensure everyone is socializing? Maybe not. But if the guest was causing discomfort to others or being disruptive, then yes. However, in this case, the guest was just standing around. \n\nThe author's frustration is understandable if they felt pressured to make the guest socialize. But kicking someone out for not interacting might be too harsh. The guest might have had valid reasons for not engaging further, like anxiety or not feeling comfortable. The author could have offered more support or given him space instead of demanding he leave. \n\nOn the other hand, the host has the right to manage their event. If someone is not contributing to the party's vibe and is a burden, the host can ask them to leave. But in this case, the guest wasn't causing trouble, just being quiet. The author's response might be seen as a bit abrupt. \n\nThe coworker's reaction (\"shitty\") suggests that the author's action was perceived as unkind. The author's defense is that the guest wasn't making an effort, but maybe the expectation was too high. It's possible the guest did try to interact but failed, leading to his withdrawal. \n\nSo, considering all angles: The author tried to help, but the final action of kicking out might be too harsh. The guest's discomfort is valid, and the host's responsibility is to the party's atmosphere. However, the line between being a social host and being a social director is thin. The author might be in the wrong for not handling it with more empathy, but not entirely. Alternatively, since the guest was not disruptive, the host's action is questionable. \n\nI think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because the host's response was too harsh and not considering the guest's possible social anxiety. The guest was trying to communicate discomfort, and the host didn't provide enough support before resorting to kicking them out.\n"
