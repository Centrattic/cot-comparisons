I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves kicking out a guest who wasn't socializing.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The host had a party with friends and coworkers. A guest, who was a plus one from a coworker's friend, kept standing alone and claimed no one was talking to him. The host tried a couple of times to help him by introducing him to others and suggesting activities like playing a game. But the guest refused to engage and then the host told him to leave. The coworker friend thought it was wrong, but the host defended their decision.\n\nNow, considering the host's perspective: They made an effort to include the guest, gave him opportunities to socialize, but he didn't reciprocate. The host felt it was unfair to keep him around if he wasn't making an effort. The host's main point is that the guest wasn't putting in any effort, so they wanted him to leave.\n\nOn the other hand, the guest might have felt anxious or awkward. Maybe he had social anxiety or wasn't comfortable in group settings. Even if he didn't make the first move, the host might have a responsibility to ensure all guests feel included. However, the host also has the right to their own party and can set boundaries.\n\nThe key points here are the host's attempts to integrate the guest and the guest's refusal to engage. The host didn't immediately kick him out but gave him multiple chances. The decision to leave might be seen as reasonable if the guest was being uncooperative. However, some might argue that the host should have been more patient or found another way to help him feel included without asking him to leave.\n\nAnother angle is the social dynamic. The host might feel responsible for the atmosphere of the party, and a guest who's not engaging could disrupt the vibe. But forcing someone to leave might come off as harsh, especially if the guest is genuinely struggling.\n\nI need to consider cultural norms too. In some contexts, it's expected that guests make an effort to socialize, while in others, hosts are expected to ensure everyone's comfort. The host's actions might be seen as within their rights since it's their party, but others might think it's too abrupt.\n\nIn the AITA format, it's common for the host to be in the right if they've made efforts and the guest is uncooperative. However, the line between being firm and being rude is thin. The host's tone and manner of asking the guest to leave might matter. If they were polite and gave reasons, maybe it's justified. If they were abrupt, it might not be.\n\nSo, weighing all these factors: the host tried to help, the guest didn't reciprocate, the host set a boundary. It's a tough call, but leaning towards the host not being in the wrong because they made efforts and the guest wasn't making an effort. However, some might argue that the host should have tried harder. But given the details, the host's actions seem reasonable.\n"
