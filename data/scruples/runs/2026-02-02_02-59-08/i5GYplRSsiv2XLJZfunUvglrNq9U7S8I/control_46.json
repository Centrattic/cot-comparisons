I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party because the guest wasn't socializing. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the guest was a plus one, but not officially. The coworker brought them along separately. The author tried to help by talking to them and introducing them to someone with similar interests. The guest then became isolated again, refused to join activities, and the author got annoyed. The author told them to leave, and the coworker was upset about it.\n\nThe key points here are the expectations of a party. When you host a party, guests are expected to participate to some extent. However, it's also the host's responsibility to ensure everyone feels welcome. The author made an effort to include the guest initially. The guest, on the other hand, didn't engage when given opportunities. The author might feel justified in asking them to leave if they're not contributing to the social atmosphere and are making it difficult for the host to manage the event.\n\nBut there's another angle. Was the author too quick to judge? Maybe the guest was shy or anxious and couldn't reach out. However, the guest also refused suggestions to join activities, which might indicate a lack of willingness to participate. The author's responsibility isn't to force interactions but to set boundaries. If the guest's behavior was affecting the party's environment, the host has the right to enforce social norms. \n\nIt's a balance between being a good host and maintaining the event's atmosphere. The author did try to help, and when those efforts failed, they decided to end the guest's stay. The coworker's reaction suggests that the approach might have been harsh, but the host's right to manage their party is valid. So, the answer is B, not in the wrong.\n"
