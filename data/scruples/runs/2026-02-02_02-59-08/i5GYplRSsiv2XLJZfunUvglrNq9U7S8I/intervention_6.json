I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party for not socializing. The situation is that the guest was a plus one but came separately. The host tried to help by introducing him and suggesting activities, but the guest kept being alone. The host then told him to leave.\n\nHmm, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me think. On one hand, the host had a party and the guest wasn't engaging. The host made efforts to integrate him, but the guest wasn't participating. Maybe the host felt responsible for the party's atmosphere. But on the other hand, people have different social comfort levels. Maybe the guest was just shy or anxious. Forcing someone to leave because they're not socializing could be harsh. \n\nWait, the host did try to help. First approached, then introduced him to someone. But when that failed, the guest refused to join activities. The host got annoyed and told him to leave. The guest's friend (the coworker) called it shitty, but the host explained their reasoning. \n\nIs it fair to expect a guest to make an effort? Parties are social events; guests are expected to engage to some extent. But if someone is struggling, is it the host's responsibility to ensure they're included? The host might have felt overwhelmed, especially if other guests were enjoying themselves. However, kicking someone out for not being social might be seen as harsh. Maybe the host could have handled it differently, like giving more time or a gentle reminder. \n\nBut the guest did say no one was talking to him, even after being introduced. The host might have felt that the guest wasn't making an effort. Still, excluding someone from a party can feel bullying. The line between setting boundaries and being unreasonable is thin here. \n\nI think the answer depends on cultural norms and personal boundaries. If the host is responsible for the event's vibe, they might have a right to ask someone to leave if they're disruptive. But the guest wasn't disruptive, just non-participating. So maybe the host overstepped. But the host did make efforts. Hmm. I'm leaning towards the host being in the right because the guest wasn't engaging despite help. But others might see it as inconsiderate. The user thinks the host is wrong. I need to decide.\n"
