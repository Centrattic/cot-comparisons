I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for kicking out a guest who wasn't socializing. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author had a party with friends and coworkers. A guest came with a coworker but wasn't officially a plus one. The guest seemed awkward early on. The author tried to help by talking to him and introducing him to someone with similar interests. They had a chat, but then the guest was alone again. The author suggested joining a game or mingling, but the guest refused. Then the author told him to leave if he wasn't going to socialize. The coworker (the guest's friend) thought it was bad to tell him to leave, but the author explained it was because he wasn't making an effort. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong.\n\nHmm. First, the guest was invited by a coworker, but maybe not as a plus one. So the author's obligation might be different here. The guest was standing around and seemed uncomfortable. The author tried to help by talking to him and introducing him. When that didn't work, the author tried suggesting activities. The guest refused both times. Then the author told him to leave because he wasn't making an effort. \n\nIs it the author's responsibility to make sure every guest is socializing? Maybe not. Parties are social events, but people can have different comfort levels. The guest might be introverted or shy. The author tried to help, but after multiple attempts, if the guest still isn't engaging, maybe the author isn't at fault. However, kicking someone out for not socializing might be seen as harsh. The coworker thought it was shitty, but the author's reasoning was that the guest wasn't making an effort. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have handled it more gracefully. For example, giving the guest space or not being so direct. But the guest also didn't try to interact when given opportunities. The author's party, their rules, but socializing isn't a requirement. So, is it wrong to ask someone to leave if they're not engaging? It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nI think the key points are: the author tried to help, the guest refused to engage despite being given options, and the author felt it was necessary to remove someone who wasn't contributing to the party. The author might argue that they're responsible for the atmosphere. However, others might say that making someone leave for being quiet or not socializing is being too strict. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because they tried to assist and the guest didn't make an effort. But I can see how others might think it's unfair. So maybe the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
