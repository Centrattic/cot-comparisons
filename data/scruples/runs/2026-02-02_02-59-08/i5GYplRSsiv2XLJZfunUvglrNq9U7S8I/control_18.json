I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about a party where a guest wasn't socializing and was kicked out. \n\nFirst, the host had a party, invited friends and coworkers. The guest was a plus one, but came separately. The host noticed he was alone a couple of times and tried to help by talking to him and introducing him to someone else. But when the guest again stood alone and refused to join activities, the host asked him to leave. The coworker (his friend) thought it was harsh, but the host felt the guest wasn't making an effort.\n\nSo, is the host wrong? Well, the host did make an effort to include the guest. The guest, on the other hand, didn't take initiative after being introduced. The host's reasoning is that the guest was expecting others to make the effort, which isn't always the case in social events. The host also mentions they were busy and couldn't baby-sit the guest.\n\nI think in this case, the host isn't in the wrong. They tried to help, and when the guest didn't reciprocate, it's reasonable to set boundaries. The host is responsible for the event's atmosphere and can't be expected to force socialization. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
