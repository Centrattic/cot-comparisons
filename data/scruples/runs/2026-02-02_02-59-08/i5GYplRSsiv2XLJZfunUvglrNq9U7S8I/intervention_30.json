I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the host made a mistake by asking a guest to leave for not socializing enough. The guest was a plus one, not explicitly invited by the host. The host tried to help him integrate by talking to him and introducing him to others, but the guest kept standing alone and refused to participate in activities.\n\nFirst, the host's responsibility might be limited. Since the guest wasn't directly invited by them, maybe the host isn't obligated to ensure the guest has a good time. However, they did make an effort initially. The guest's behavior\u2014repeatedly not engaging despite opportunities\u2014could be seen as not respecting the social setting. \n\nOn the other hand, kicking someone out can feel harsh. The guest might have had valid reasons for being uncomfortable, like social anxiety. The host's frustration is understandable if the guest is being passive-aggressive or uncooperative. But does that justify asking them to leave? It might depend on the host's expectations for the party. If the party is supposed to be a social event, guests are expected to participate to some extent. However, expecting someone to \"network\" on their own can be tough if they're introverted or nervous.\n\nThe coworker who brought the guest was upset, which adds a layer. The host's explanation might not have been clear enough, leading to the coworker feeling defensive. But the host also has the right to manage their event, especially if someone's behavior is affecting the atmosphere. \n\nSo, is the host at fault? If the guest was causing a disruption or not respecting the social norms of the gathering, then maybe not. But if the guest's lack of socializing was due to personal issues and the host didn't give enough support, then the host might be too quick to judge. The line between enforcing social norms and being inclusive is thin here. The host's actions might be seen as reasonable, but the approach could have been more empathetic to avoid making someone feel excluded. Therefore, the answer could lean towards A, the host is in the wrong, because pushing someone out for not socializing might be too harsh without understanding deeper reasons or providing more support.\n"
