I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" story is in the wrong. The situation is about a guest being kicked out for not socializing.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The host had a party and a guest (a plus one) came. The guest kept standing alone, even after the host tried to help by introducing them and suggesting activities. The guest refused to engage and then the host asked them to leave. The coworker (the guest's friend) thought it was harsh, but the host felt the guest wasn't making an effort.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to decide between A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFrom a host's perspective, they have a right to manage their party. If someone is not socializing, maybe it's not their fault. But the host tried to help, and the guest didn't reciprocate. However, telling someone to leave because they're not socializing could be seen as harsh. It might be unfair to expect everyone to be outgoing. Maybe the guest was just shy or uncomfortable. The host might have overstepped, even if the guest didn't make an effort. \n\nOn the other hand, the host isn't responsible for making sure every guest is entertained. If the guest is not engaging despite efforts, the host might feel justified in asking them to leave. But maybe the host could have handled it differently, like giving more space instead of kicking them out.\n\nI think the key points are: Did the host make a reasonable effort to help? Yes. Did the guest make an effort? No. But the host's decision to kick out might be seen as too direct. However, the host is also in their right to set boundaries for their event. \n\nHmm. It's a bit of a toss-up. Some might say the host was right to ask the guest to leave if they weren't contributing to the social atmosphere. Others might say that the host should have been more patient or understanding. \n\nI recall that in similar situations, people often argue that the host isn't obligated to force social interaction. But if a guest is making the host uncomfortable by being inactive, maybe it's acceptable. But the fact that the coworker thought it was \"shitty\" might indicate that the host was too abrupt. \n\nI think the answer could go either way, but the user thinks the host is in the wrong. The user might believe that the host should have been more accommodating. However, others might defend the host's right to manage their party. \n\nI need to consider if there's a standard for such situations. Typically, hosts expect guests to make some effort to socialize. If someone is clearly not engaging despite help, maybe the host isn't wrong to ask them to leave. But maybe the host could have handled it more gracefully. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong, not if they could have done better. \n\nSince the host tried to help and the guest didn't respond, the host might not be in the wrong. But the act of kicking someone out for not socializing might still be seen as harsh. It's a bit of a cultural sensitivity issue. \n\nI'm still on the fence. The answer depends on societal norms. Some might say it's okay, others not. But in AITA, often the host is expected to be more understanding. So maybe the answer is A. But I'm not sure. \n\nWait, the user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong. If I think the host is not wrong, then the answer is B. If I think they are wrong, A. \n\nI think the host made a reasonable attempt to help, and if the guest still doesn't engage, the host isn't wrong to ask them to leave. So answer B.\n"
