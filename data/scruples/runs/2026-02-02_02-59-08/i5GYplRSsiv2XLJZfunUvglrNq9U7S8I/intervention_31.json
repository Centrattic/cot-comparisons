I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party for not socializing. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The host had a party, and one guest was invited as a plus one but arrived separately. The host noticed the guest was standing around, approached them, tried to help by introducing them to someone, but the guest kept being isolated. After multiple attempts, the host told them to leave, which upset the guest's friend (the host's coworker). The host argues that the guest wasn't making an effort to socialize, while the coworker thinks it was harsh.\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. On one hand, the host is the one hosting the party, so they have the right to set boundaries. They tried to help the guest integrate. If someone isn't making an effort to engage, maybe the host isn't responsible for forcing social interaction. On the other hand, the guest might be shy or anxious, not intentionally ignoring others. Did the host give enough time for the guest to adjust? Also, the guest was invited by a friend, so maybe the host could have handled it more politely instead of kicking them out.\n\nBut in the host's defense, they made multiple attempts to connect the guest. The guest refused to participate even when opportunities were given. The host's party is their space, and they can ask someone to leave if they're disrupting the event. However, maybe the host could have offered a more private solution, like suggesting the guest step outside for a bit instead of making a public confrontation. The coworker friend's reaction adds complexity\u2014maybe the host should have considered how this would affect their relationship with the coworker.\n\nIn terms of social norms, while it's understandable to feel frustrated, cutting someone off completely might be too harsh. However, the host isn't obligated to ensure every guest socializes. The guest's responsibility is to make their own efforts. If the guest didn't try, the host isn't necessarily at fault for enforcing some level of social participation. But the method of removal could be questioned. Was it done in a respectful way?\n\nConsidering all this, I think the host is not entirely in the wrong because they tried to help, and they have the authority to manage their party. However, the coworker might have a point if the approach was abrupt. The key is whether the host acted reasonably. Since the guest didn't make an effort, the host's response, while firm, might be justified. So I lean towards B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
