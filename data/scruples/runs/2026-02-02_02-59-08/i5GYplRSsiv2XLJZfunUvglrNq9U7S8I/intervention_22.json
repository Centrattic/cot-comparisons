I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is wrong for kicking a guest out of their party for not socializing. The scenario is that the guest was a plus one but came separately. The host noticed the guest was standing around awkwardly, tried to help by talking to him and introducing him to someone with similar interests. The guest then ended up alone again, refused suggestions to join a game or mingle, and the host got annoyed, telling him to leave. The coworker (the guest's friend) thought it was shitty, but the host defended their decision.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from different angles. The host's perspective: they were hosting a party, made efforts to include the guest, but when the guest didn't take initiative, they felt it was their responsibility to maintain the environment. The guest's side: maybe he's shy, anxious, or not into the party scene. The coworker's reaction suggests that the friend might feel the host was too harsh.\n\nThe key points here are the host's responsibility to their own event and the guest's behavior. The host did try to help, but after the guest repeatedly didn't engage, the host decided to ask him to leave. The question is whether the host overstepped.\n\nSome might argue that the host isn't responsible for the guest's social interactions once they've made an effort. Others might think that the host has the right to manage their party and set boundaries. The guest's refusal to participate could be seen as not respecting the host's effort to include him. However, maybe the guest had legitimate reasons for discomfort, and the host's reaction was too abrupt.\n\nAlso, the guest was a plus one, which might imply that they were expected but not the main invitee. The host could feel that the guest's presence was an inconvenience if they weren't contributing to the social environment. On the other hand, excluding someone from a party can be hurtful, and the host's approach might have been harsh.\n\nI should consider cultural norms and common practices. In some social circles, it's expected that guests make an effort to socialize. If the guest refuses all overtures, the host might feel justified in removing them. However, others might say that the host should be more accommodating, especially in a social setting where not everyone is comfortable.\n\nAnother angle: the host is responsible for the atmosphere of their party. If someone is making the event uncomfortable by not participating and being a passive burden, the host has the right to ask them to leave. But the host's approach of telling the guest to leave directly might be seen as rude, even if justified.\n\nThe coworker's reaction adds another layer. The host defended their decision by saying they didn't have time to drag the guest around, which might be valid if the host is also trying to enjoy the party and manage other guests. But the coworker might not have appreciated the guest being singled out and asked to leave.\n\nIn conclusion, it's a bit subjective. The host made an effort to help, and if the guest still refused to engage, maybe the host isn't wrong. However, the decision to kick someone out might be seen as harsh. The answer hinges on whether the host's actions were reasonable given their efforts and the context of their own event.\n"
