I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The author hosted a party, had a guest who was a plus one. The guest kept saying no one was talking to him, even after the author tried to help by introducing him to someone with similar interests. The guest then stood alone again, refused to join activities, and the author eventually told him to leave. The coworker friend of the guest thought it was \"shitty\" to kick him out, but the author felt justified.\n\nFirst, the guest's behavior: he seems to be struggling socially. Maybe he's shy, anxious, or not comfortable in large groups. The author tried twice to help him by introducing him and suggesting activities. But the guest didn't take initiative. The issue here is whether the author was too harsh. \n\nThe author's responsibility is to maintain the party's atmosphere. If a guest is not engaging and is making the host uncomfortable, is it reasonable to ask them to leave? On the other hand, maybe the guest truly couldn't socialize that night, and the author could have been more patient. \n\nBut the key points are: the guest didn't make any effort to talk to others after being introduced. The author gave clear suggestions and he didn't follow through. The author also mentions they didn't have time to drag him around. Hosting a party requires managing the environment, and if someone is being a burden, it's acceptable to ask them to leave. \n\nThe coworker's reaction might be more about defending their friend than understanding the situation. The author did try to help, but the guest's inaction led to the decision. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
