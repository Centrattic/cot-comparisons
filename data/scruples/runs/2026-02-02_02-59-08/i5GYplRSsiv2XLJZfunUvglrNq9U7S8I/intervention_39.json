I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party for not socializing. The answer options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation clearly. The host had a party and noticed a guest who was the friend of a coworker. This guest came separately but was invited as a plus one, though it's a bit unclear. The guest stood around awkwardly, said no one was talking to him, so the host tried to help by talking to him and introducing him to others. However, after a few attempts, the guest still wasn't engaging, leading the host to tell him to leave. The coworker friend was upset, but the host felt the guest wasn't making an effort.\n\nNow, considering the host's perspective: they tried to help the guest integrate into the party by talking to him and introducing him to people. The guest, however, refused to join activities and kept standing alone. The host might feel frustrated, especially if the guest is not contributing to the social atmosphere and is perhaps expecting others to accommodate him without effort. The host has the right to manage their own party and set boundaries, especially if someone's behavior is affecting the event's enjoyment.\n\nOn the other hand, the guest might feel anxious or out of place. Social situations can be challenging for some people, and even if someone is trying to help, it doesn't always work. The host's decision to ask him to leave could be seen as harsh if the guest was genuinely trying to cope with social anxiety. However, the host isn't required to constantly monitor and facilitate interactions for every guest. There's a balance between being hospitable and setting reasonable expectations for attendees to participate social activities.\n\nLegally and socially, the host is within their rights to ask someone to leave if they feel the person isn't adhering to the party's social norms. However, some might argue that the host could have been more patient or found another solution. But given the scenario, the host made several attempts to help the guest, which shows they tried to be accommodating. The guest's refusal to engage might justify the host's action, as the host can't be responsible for everyone's social integration entirely.\n\nIn conclusion, while the host's actions might seem abrupt, they were trying to manage their event and maintain a comfortable environment for all. The guest's lack of effort to socialize, despite the host's help, could support the decision to ask him to leave. Therefore, the host might not be in the wrong here.\n"
