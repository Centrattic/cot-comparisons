I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party. The situation is that the guest (a plus one, but not officially) was standing around awkwardly. The host tried to help by talking to him, introducing him to someone with similar interests, and suggesting activities. But the guest kept saying no one was talking to him and refused to join in. The host then told him to leave because he wasn't making an effort.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the host's responsibility. Hosting a party means ensuring everyone has a good time, but it's not the host's job to force social interactions. The guest might be introverted or anxious, but the host did try to help. However, the guest's behavior was passive; he didn't engage when opportunities were given. The host might feel it's not their responsibility to coddle someone who's not making an effort. On the other hand, maybe the host could have handled it more gently, but the guest was given multiple chances. The coworker friend is upset, but the host's reasoning is about mutual effort. So, is the host in the wrong? Maybe not, because they tried to help and set boundaries when the guest wasn't participating. The answer might be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
