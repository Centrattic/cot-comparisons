I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author hosted a party and invited some friends and coworkers. A guest, who was a plus one but not officially invited, came along with a coworker. The author noticed this guy was standing around awkwardly and tried to help by talking to him and introducing him to someone else. But after a couple of attempts, the guy was still alone, didn't engage in activities like the Uno game, and the author got annoyed. Eventually, the author told him to leave because he wasn't making an effort to socialize.\n\nHmm. The key points here are whether the author overstepped or was justified. The author did make efforts to include the guest initially, which is good. But after a couple of failed attempts, the guest still wasn't engaging. The author felt it was the guest's responsibility to make an effort, not the host's to constantly drag others to interact. \n\nI think the line is whether the host is being unreasonable. If the guest didn't want to socialize, maybe that's his choice, but if he's causing discomfort or not respecting the party's social environment, the host might have the right to ask him to leave. The author didn't just kick him out immediately; they tried to help multiple times. The guest's refusal to participate despite being offered opportunities could mean that the author was justified in asking him to leave. \n\nAlso, considering that the guest was a plus one but not officially invited, maybe the host felt it was acceptable to set boundaries. The coworker who was the host might have a different opinion, but the author explained their reasoning. It's a bit of a judgment call, but I think the author isn't in the wrong because they made efforts to include and when that didn't work, setting a boundary is reasonable. So the answer would be B.\n"
