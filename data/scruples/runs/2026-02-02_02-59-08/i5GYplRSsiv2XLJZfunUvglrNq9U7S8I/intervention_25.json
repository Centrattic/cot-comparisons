I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who hosted a party is in the wrong for kicking out a guest who wasn't socializing. The host says they tried talking to the guest, introduced him to someone else, suggested joining a game, but the guest kept standing alone. The host got annoyed and told him to leave. The coworker friend of the guest thought it was shitty.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the host's perspective. They put effort into the party, made food and games. The guest was a plus one but not officially invited. The host tried to help him integrate but he didn't make the effort. Maybe the host felt it wasn't their responsibility to force socialization. On the other hand, the guest might have been genuinely shy or uncomfortable. The host could have handled it more politely, maybe given him a heads-up to leave instead of a direct order. \n\nThe coworker friend criticized the host, but the host explained they were busy. The question is whether the host was justified. Social situations can be tricky. If the guest was making the host uncomfortable by not contributing to the social environment, it's fair to ask him to leave. But maybe the host could have been more patient or given more time. Also, the guest might have felt embarrassed. \n\nIn similar situations, hosts often handle it by politely asking someone to leave if they're disruptive or uninvolved. Since this guest wasn't engaging and was a plus one, the host might not feel obligated to keep him. However, the abruptness of the action might be a point. The key is whether the host's actions were reasonable given the circumstances. Considering all that, I think the host isn't in the wrong because they tried to help and the guest wasn't making an effort. So answer B.\n"
