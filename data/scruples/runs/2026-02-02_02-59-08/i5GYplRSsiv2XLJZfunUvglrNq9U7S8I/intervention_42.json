I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party for not socializing. The situation is that the guest was a plus one, not officially invited. The author tried to help the guest by introducing him to someone, but he kept standing around alone. The author then told him to leave because he wasn't making an effort. The coworker friend of the guest said it was shitty, so the author is wondering if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms here. Hosting a party comes with certain responsibilities, like ensuring guests feel comfortable. The author did try to help the guest by introducing them to someone. However, the guest didn't engage further. The author might have felt that if the guest wasn't participating, they were being inconsiderate of the host's time and the other guests. On the other hand, the guest might have been shy or awkward, and maybe the host was too quick to give up. \n\nThe key points here are: Was the guest's behavior really unacceptable? Did the host give them enough opportunity to engage? The guest was a plus one, so maybe they weren't as familiar with the group. The host intervened twice, but the guest didn't take initiative. The host's action of asking them to leave could be seen as necessary if they were disruptive or not contributing, but if the guest was just quiet, maybe it's harsh. However, the host is also responsible for the party's atmosphere. If the guest was making the host uncomfortable by not socializing, then the host has a right to ask them to leave. But the coworker's reaction might indicate that the host's response was too harsh. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the host's responsibility versus the guest's responsibility is often a point of discussion. The host tried to help, but maybe the guest is responsible for their own socializing. However, the host might have overstepped by telling them to leave. But if the guest was using the host's time and not engaging, the host might have a valid point. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether the host was reasonable in their expectations. The guest didn't try to engage after being introduced, so maybe the host isn't in the wrong. But if the guest was just a quiet person, maybe the host should have given more time. However, the host did give help and the guest didn't take it. So perhaps the host is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
