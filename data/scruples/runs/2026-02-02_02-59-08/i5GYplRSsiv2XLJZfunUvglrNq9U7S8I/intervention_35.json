I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party for not socializing.\n\nFirst, the situation: The host had a party, and a guest (a plus one of a coworker) came. The guest was acting awkward, and the host tried to help by talking to him and introducing him to someone with similar interests. But the guest kept standing alone, not engaging, even when the host suggested joining a game or mingling. The host got annoyed and told him to leave if he was just going to stand around. The coworker friend was upset about it.\n\nHmm. So, the host tried to integrate the guest by talking and introducing him. The guest didn't take initiative, kept being isolated. The host's actions seem to be a last resort after efforts failed. But was it right to kick him out?\n\nI need to consider social norms. As a host, it's their house, and they have the right to ask someone to leave if they're not contributing or making others uncomfortable. The guest might have been socially awkward, but maybe the host overstepped by telling him to leave. On the other hand, the host isn't obligated to baby-sit someone who refuses to engage.\n\nWait, the guest claimed no one was talking to him, but the host had just introduced him. Maybe the guest was being passive, expecting others to approach him. The host's response was frustration, leading to the ultimatum. Is that harsh? Or is it reasonable to set boundaries?\n\nAlso, the coworker friend was upset. That could indicate that the host might have overreacted, especially since the guest was a plus one. Maybe the host should have handled it more privately, but ultimately, it's the host's party. I'm torn. Maybe the host isn't in the wrong because they tried to help and then enforced a policy of participation. But some might see it as unforgiving. I think the answer depends on cultural attitudes. In some contexts, the host is justified; in others, it might be seen as rude. But the key points are the host's attempts to assist and the guest's refusal to engage. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But I need to make sure. Let me check again. The host didn't just kick him out for being shy; after multiple failed attempts, the host gave a warning. So probably B.\n"
