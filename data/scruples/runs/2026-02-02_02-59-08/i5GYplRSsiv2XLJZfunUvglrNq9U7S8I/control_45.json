I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party for not socializing. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The host had a party and invited friends and coworkers. A guest, who came with a coworker but wasn't really a plus one, was standing around alone. The host tried to help by introducing him to others and suggesting activities, but the guest kept coming back saying no one is talking to him. Eventually, the host told him to leave.\n\nNow, considering the facts. The host made efforts to help the guest interact. They talked to him, introduced him to someone with similar interests, even suggested joining a game. The guest didn't take initiative beyond that. The host might have felt frustrated because they were trying to be hospitable but the guest wasn't making efforts. \n\nIs it the host's responsibility to ensure every guest is socializing? Maybe not. Parties are social events, but some people might be more introverted or uncomfortable. It's possible the guest was shy or anxious. However, the host isn't obligated to force interactions. On the other hand, kicking someone out might be seen as harsh if the guest was genuinely trying but struggling. \n\nBut in this case, the guest didn't try after the initial help. The host's actions were proactive. The coworker friend who was with the guest might have felt the host was too abrupt, but the host explained their reasoning. \n\nSo, the host isn't in the wrong because they tried to assist and set boundaries. The guest's behavior was passive, and the host had every right to ask him to leave if he wasn't engaging. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
