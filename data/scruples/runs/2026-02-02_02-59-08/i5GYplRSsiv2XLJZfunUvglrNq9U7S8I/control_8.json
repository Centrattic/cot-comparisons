I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" story is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party for not socializing. \n\nFirst, the setup: the author hosted a party, invited friends and coworkers. The problematic guest was a plus one who came separately. The guest became a bit of a social isolate, approached the host twice for help, but didn't take the host's suggestions to mingle or join a game. The host then told the guest to leave.\n\nI need to consider the host's perspective. They were organizing the event, which requires effort. The guest didn't make an effort to integrate, despite being offered assistance. The host felt it was too much responsibility to keep facilitating interactions for someone who wasn't contributing. \n\nOn the other hand, the guest might have been socially anxious or uncomfortable. The host could have handled it differently, maybe by offering more support or understanding. However, the guest's repeated refusal to engage could be seen as a failure to participate in the social event they were invited to.\n\nThe host's action of asking the guest to leave might be justified if the guest was not following basic social norms of the party. Parties typically require attendees to interact to some extent. The host is also within their rights to manage their own event as they see fit, especially when a guest isn't adhering to the social expectations.\n\nBut then again, is it the host's responsibility to ensure every guest is socializing? Maybe not. The host provided help, and when the guest didn't take it, the host decided it was too much. The coworker friend (the one who brought the guest) was upset, but the host explained their reasoning. \n\nIn terms of social norms, it's common for guests to at least attempt to socialize. If someone is completely disengaged and refuses all overtures, the host might feel justified in removing them. But there's also a consideration for guests who might be shy or introverted. The line here is thin. \n\nThe key points are: the host tried to help, the guest didn't reciprocate, and the host felt the guest was using them as a social crutch. The host's decision to ask the guest to leave might be seen as reasonable, especially in a private event where the host has control over the environment. However, some might argue that the host should have been more patient or offered more options. But given that the guest was a plus one and not a close friend, the host's tolerance might be lower.\n\nSo, weighing both sides, the host's action might not be wrong. The answer is B.\n"
