I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party for not socializing. The scenario is from an AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post. \n\nFirst, the author hosted a party with friends and coworkers. The guest in question was a plus one but not officially invited. The guest kept saying no one was talking to him, even after the author tried to help by introducing him and suggesting activities. The author eventually told him to leave because he wasn't making an effort.\n\nI need to consider the social norms and responsibilities here. As a host, the author is responsible for ensuring guests are comfortable, but also for the overall atmosphere of the event. The guest was a plus one, which might mean he wasn't expected to be the center of attention. However, the author did make efforts to help him integrate. On the other hand, the guest might have felt anxious or overwhelmed, which isn't uncommon in social settings. \n\nThe key points are whether the author overstepped by asking him to leave. Was it reasonable to expect the guest to make an effort, or was the author being too harsh? The guest did say he was uncomfortable, so maybe the author could have tried another approach. But the guest also refused suggestions to mingle or join a game, indicating a lack of effort. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, hosts often have the right to ask guests to leave if they're disruptive. However, the situation here isn't about disruptive behavior but rather social discomfort. The author's frustration is understandable, but kicking someone out for being shy or not socializing might be seen as harsh. However, the guest wasn't causing a disturbance, just wasn't engaging. \n\nI think the author might be in the right because the guest wasn't adhering to the social expectations of a party, but there's also the consideration of empathy. The answer might depend on cultural or personal views on social responsibilities. If the party is a social event, guests are expected to participate to some extent. If the guest couldn't do that, maybe it's their fault. But if the host's solution was too abrupt, that's another angle. \n\nThe coworker (the friend of the guest) felt it was \"shitty,\" which could indicate that the author's approach was too harsh. However, the author explained their reasoning. The line between being a considerate host and being overbearing can be thin here. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because they tried to help and set boundaries when the guest wasn't making an effort. But there's a counter-argument that the guest might have had valid reasons for not socializing. However, in the context of a social event, it's expected to at least try. So the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
