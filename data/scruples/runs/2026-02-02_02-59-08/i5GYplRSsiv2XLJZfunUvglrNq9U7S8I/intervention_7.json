I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for kicking a party guest out for not socializing. The situation is that a guest was invited by a coworker, came alone or as a plus one, and then stood around awkwardly. The host tried to help by introducing him to others, but when he continued to isolate himself, the host told him to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the responsibilities of a host. As the host, it's their job to provide a space for guests to enjoy, but they aren't obligated to force interactions. However, the guest was already trying to socialize, and the host did attempt to help. But when the guest didn't take those opportunities, the host got annoyed and asked him to leave. \n\nIs it reasonable for the host to set boundaries? If the guest is not engaging despite efforts, maybe the host is within their rights to ask them to leave if they're disrupting the event. However, some might argue that the host should be more patient and understanding of social anxiety or shyness. \n\nOn the other hand, the host is also managing their own time and energy. They can't be expected to constantly facilitate interactions for every guest. The guest's refusal to engage in activities might be seen as uncooperative. \n\nThe coworker friend who invited him might feel the host was too harsh, but the host is responsible for their own party. The question is whether the host's actions were justified. If the guest was making no effort, then the host isn't in the wrong. But if the guest had a valid reason for being shy, maybe the host could have been more inclusive. However, the guest's repeated refusal to participate might have crossed a line. \n\nI think the key points are: the host tried to help, the guest didn't take the initiative, and the host set a boundary. Whether that boundary was appropriate depends on the context. Since the guest was not causing disruption other than being unengaged, maybe the host could have handled it differently, but ultimately, the host isn't in the wrong for asking someone to leave if they're not contributing to the event.\n"
