I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party for not socializing.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The host had a party with friends and coworkers. A guest, who was a plus one but not officially invited, came with a coworker. The guest was standing around awkwardly, said no one was talking to him. The host tried introducing him to someone with similar interests, but after a short interaction, the guest was alone again. The host then suggested games and mingling, which the guest refused. The host told the guest to leave, and the guest left. The coworker (the guest's friend) thought it was shitty, but the host explained they couldn't spend time dragging him around.\n\nSo the question is, is the host in the wrong? The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants another opinion.\n\nI need to consider a few factors. First, the guest was a plus one but not officially invited. That might mean they weren't expected to be a main attendee. Hosts often have the right to set boundaries for their event. If someone is not engaging and being a plus one, maybe they're not there to socialize but to tag along. The host tried to help by introducing him, offering activities, but the guest didn't take initiative. The host's responsibility is to their own party and other guests' enjoyment. If a guest is not contributing, it's reasonable to ask them to leave, especially if they're not making an effort. However, the host's approach might be harsh, but the guest didn't make an effort either. The key is whether the host overstepped by asking someone to leave for not socializing. Also, the guest wasn't being disruptive, just awkward. But maybe the host felt it's their right to manage the party. The coworker's friend might have been inconsiderate, but the host had the final say on their own event. So the host isn't necessarily in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
