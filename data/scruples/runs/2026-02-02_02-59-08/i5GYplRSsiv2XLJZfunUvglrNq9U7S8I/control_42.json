I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is that the host kicked out a guest who wasn't socializing. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the host had a party with friends and coworkers. The guest was a plus one but came separately. The host tried to help him by talking to him and introducing him to someone. The guest kept being alone and refused to engage in games or mingle. The host got annoyed and told him to leave. The coworker friend was upset, but the host defended their decision.\n\nSo, is the host in the wrong? Well, hosting a party is the host's space, so they have the right to set boundaries. The guest didn't make an effort to socialize despite being helped twice. The host tried to be accommodating, but when the guest was uncooperative, it's understandable to ask them to leave. The coworker friend is the one who invited the guest, but the host isn't responsible for others' guests' behavior unless they're being disruptive. The guest's behavior was passive-aggressive, not actually being a problem, but the host had the right to enforce their rules. So the answer is probably B, the host isn't in the wrong.\n"
