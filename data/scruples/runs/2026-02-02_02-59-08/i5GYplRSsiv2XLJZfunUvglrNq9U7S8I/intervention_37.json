I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party because he wasn't socializing. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The host had a party, invited friends and coworkers, and had a guest who was a plus one but came separately. The guest was standing around awkwardly, and the host tried to help by introducing him to someone and suggesting activities. When the guest didn't engage further and kept being isolated, the host told him to leave. The coworker friend of the guest didn't support the host's action, saying it was shitty, but the host explained that the guest wasn't making an effort.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Did the host have a right to ask the guest to leave? Was the guest's behavior justified? The host tried to help but the guest didn't reciprocate. The guest might have been shy or not interested, but the host might feel responsible for the party's atmosphere. However, forcing someone to socialize isn't reasonable. On the other hand, if someone is making the host uncomfortable by not participating and the host has the right to manage their own party, they might not be in the wrong.\n\nBut wait, is it the host's responsibility to make sure every guest is socializing? Maybe not. The host tried to help, and when the guest didn't engage, the host decided he was being uncooperative. However, the guest might have just been introverted or had other reasons. The host's reaction might be seen as harsh, but they have the right to control their own event. The coworker's friend is upset, which might indicate that the host's action wasn't well-received. But the host's perspective is that they were doing their best and the guest wasn't making an effort.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, sometimes the host is seen as having the right to manage their space. However, the line is thin. If the guest was being a burden or causing disruption, then the host is justified. But if the guest was just not socializing and wasn't disruptive, the host might be overstepping. The answer here could be either way. The host tried to help, but maybe should have given more time or not taken it so personally. However, the host did make an effort and the guest didn't reciprocate. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. I think the answer is B, No.\n"
