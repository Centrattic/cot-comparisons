I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about inviting a guest to a party who didn't socialize and was kicked out.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The host had a party and invited friends and coworkers. A guest came with a coworker but wasn't a plus-one. The guest was standing around awkwardly, said no one was talking to him. The host tried to help by introducing him to someone with similar interests, but after that, he was alone again. The host suggested joining a game or mingling, but he refused. Then the host told him to leave, and the coworker friend was upset about it.\n\nNow, considering the host's perspective: Hosting a party is a social event, and it's reasonable to expect guests to participate to some extent. The host made efforts to help the guest integrate but noticed he wasn't making an effort himself. The host might feel that constant passivity is not acceptable and that they can't be responsible for every guest's social interactions beyond a reasonable effort.\n\nOn the other hand, the guest might feel anxious or shy, and might not know how to approach others. Social anxiety is real, and not everyone is comfortable in large groups. The host's action of asking him to leave could seem harsh, especially if the guest was genuinely trying but struggling.\n\nBut the key points here are that the host made active attempts to help the guest (talking to him, introducing him, suggesting activities), but the guest refused to engage. The host might feel that if someone isn't making an effort, it's better to ask them to leave to maintain the party's atmosphere. However, some might argue that the host could have given more time or found another way to help him feel included.\n\nThe coworker friend's reaction is also a point. She thought it was \"shitty,\" implying that the host's action was harsh. But the host explained that they couldn't spend their time dragging people around. It's a balance between being kind and managing the event.\n\nIn terms of social norms, it's generally acceptable to ask someone to leave if they're disruptive, but standing around awkwardly isn't necessarily disruptive. However, if someone is not making any effort to participate and is being passive, some might see it as acceptable to ask them to leave to preserve the event's quality for others.\n\nSo, considering all angles: the host did try to help, the guest didn't reciprocate, and the host's decision was to set a boundary. It's a bit of a grey area, but leaning towards B (author not in the wrong) because they made efforts and had the right to manage their event. However, there's a nuance where maybe more patience could have been shown, but the host isn't necessarily at fault here.\n"
