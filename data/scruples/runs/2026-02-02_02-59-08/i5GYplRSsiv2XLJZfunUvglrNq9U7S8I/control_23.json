I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party for not socializing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The host had a party, invited friends and coworkers. A guest came with a coworker but was standing around alone. The host tried to help by talking to him, introducing him to someone else, suggesting activities. The guest kept saying no one was talking to him even after interactions. The host got annoyed, told him to leave if he's just going to stand there. The coworker friend was upset about it.\n\nSo, the host's actions: they made an effort to include the guest, but when the guest didn't engage and kept complaining, the host decided to ask him to leave. The host's reasoning was that the guest wasn't making an effort to socialize and the host couldn't be responsible for dragging him into conversations.\n\nPossible angles: The host has the right to set boundaries at their own party. If the guest was disrupting the event by not participating and just expecting others to approach him, the host might feel justified. However, the host could have handled it more kindly. On the other hand, the guest might have felt anxious or overwhelmed, and maybe the host was too quick to judge. The host's responsibility is to their own event and other guests, so if one guest is causing issues, removing them isn't unreasonable.\n\nThe guest's perspective: Maybe he was shy or struggling socially, and the host's response was harsh. But the host tried to help, and the guest didn't reciprocate. The host might not be in the wrong for expecting guests to make some effort.\n\nThe coworker's reaction says it was \"shitty,\" but the host explained their reasoning. The host's main point is that they didn't have the time or obligation to force interactions.\n\nIn similar AITA scenarios, hosts often have the right to ask guests to leave if they're disruptive or not following the social norms of the event, especially if they've made efforts to include them. The key here is whether the host's actions were reasonable given the circumstances. The host tried multiple times to help the guest integrate, and when the guest didn't engage, they asked him to leave. That seems within their rights as the host. The guest might have been expecting others to approach him, but generally, social events require some level of participant effort. So the host isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
