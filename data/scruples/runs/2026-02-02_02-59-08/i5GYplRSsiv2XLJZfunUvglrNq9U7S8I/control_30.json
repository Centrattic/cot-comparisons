I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for kicking out a guest who wasn't socializing. The story goes like this: the host had a party, a guest was a plus one, came separately. The guest stood around awkwardly, said no one was talking to him. The host tried to help by talking to him, introducing him to someone, but then he was alone again. The guest refused to join a game or mingle, so the host told him to leave. The coworker (his friend) thought it was shitty, but the host felt he wasn't making an effort.\n\nHmm, so the question is whether the host was in the wrong. Let's break it down. The host did try to help the guest by engaging him and introducing him. But after that, the guest didn't make an effort to interact further. The host might have felt responsible for the guest's comfort but also had their own party to manage. However, telling someone to leave because they're not socializing could be seen as harsh. Maybe the host should have given more time or encouragement instead of kicking him out. On the other hand, the guest might have been expecting others to approach him, not taking initiative. The host's responsibility isn't to force interactions. \n\nI think the host isn't entirely wrong. The guest had a part in not making an effort. But the host could have handled it more gracefully. However, since the guest was a plus one and maybe not the host's closest friend, the host isn't obligated to ensure his comfort beyond a certain point. So the answer might be B, the author isn't in the wrong. But maybe there's a nuance I'm missing. Like, was it appropriate to tell someone to leave for not socializing? Some might argue that the host should have been more patient, others might support the host's decision to manage the party. I think it's a judgment call, but leaning towards B since the host tried to help and the guest wasn't cooperative.\n"
