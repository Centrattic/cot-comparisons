I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

The situation is that the guest was a plus one but not officially invited. The author tried to help him by introducing him to someone, but he kept standing alone. The author got annoyed and told him to leave.\n\nHmm. I need to consider both sides. The author hosted the party, so they have some responsibility to make guests feel included. But the guest didn't make an effort to socialize, just waited for others to approach. The author tried to help, but when the guest didn't take initiative, they asked him to leave.\n\nIs it the author's responsibility to constantly facilitate social interactions? Maybe to a point, but guests are expected to make some effort. The guest's behavior could be seen as passive or expecting others to accommodate him. However, the author might have handled it differently, like offering more assistance or being more patient.\n\nThe coworker friend (the plus one's companion) thought it was shitty to tell him to leave. That's a point against the author. But the author might have felt they couldn't manage the situation further. It's a balance between being a good host and respecting personal boundaries. Did the author overstep, or was it reasonable to ask someone to leave if they weren't contributing to the social environment?\n\nI think the author might not be in the wrong entirely. They tried to help, and the guest didn't take initiative. But maybe they could have handled it more gracefully. However, the key is whether the author acted unreasonably. Since the guest wasn't making an effort, maybe it's not the author's fault. So answer B.\n"
