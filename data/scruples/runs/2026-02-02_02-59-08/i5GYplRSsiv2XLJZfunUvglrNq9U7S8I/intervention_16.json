I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is wrong for kicking a guest out of their party for not socializing.\n\nSo, the setup is that the author had a party, a guest (a friend of a coworker) came and kept saying people weren't talking to him. The author tried to help by introducing him to someone else and suggesting activities, but the guest kept standing alone. Eventually, the author told him to leave, and the coworker (who was his friend) was upset.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my opinion. I need to decide between A (Yes, in the wrong) or B (No, not in the wrong). Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the guest was a plus one but not officially invited. The author was generous with food and drinks. The guest initially was awkward, and the author tried to help by engaging him and introducing him to others. The guest then went back to being alone, refused suggestions to join activities, and the author got annoyed, thinking the guest wanted attention without effort. Then the author told him to leave, and the coworker was upset.\n\nSo, from the author's perspective, they were trying to be helpful but felt the guest wasn't making an effort. From the guest's side, maybe he felt uncomfortable or wasn't able to socialize, leading to the situation where he felt isolated. \n\nIs it fair for the author to kick someone out for not socializing? Well, hosting a party involves managing the environment, and if someone is being a burden or not contributing to the social aspect, maybe the host has the right to ask them to leave if it's affecting the event. However, it's also about how to handle it. The author did try to help, but maybe the guest had personal issues making socializing difficult. The author might have overstepped by not being more patient or providing alternative solutions.\n\nBut then again, the author is entitled to their space and can set boundaries. If someone is not engaging despite efforts, it's reasonable to ask them to leave. However, the line is blurry here. The key points are: Did the author give the guest enough opportunities to integrate? The author did introduce him once and suggested activities. The guest's refusal might indicate he wasn't interested in participating. But maybe the author could have been more empathetic, considering the guest might be shy or anxious. \n\nIn some cases, people might need more time or different approaches. The author might have acted abruptly. However, it's also the host's responsibility to manage their gathering. If someone is not engaging and it's causing stress, it's understandable to ask them to leave. The coworker's reaction suggests that the action was harsh, but the author's reasoning is that the guest wasn't making an effort.\n\nI think it's a judgment call. The author tried, but maybe the reaction was too harsh. However, the guest's behavior could be seen as not respecting the host's efforts. So, depending on the perspective, it could be either A or B. But given that the host is trying to manage their event, and the guest wasn't contributing, the answer might lean towards B, not in the wrong. However, if the guest had a legitimate reason for being unable to socialize, then the host should be more understanding. But since the scenario doesn't provide that, maybe the host isn't in the wrong.\n"
