I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party. The guest was a \"plus one\" from a coworker, and the author noticed he was standing around alone. They tried to help by talking to him and introducing him to others, but he kept being isolated and didn't engage. The author then told him to leave, and the coworker was upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author hosted a party, which means they have some responsibility to ensure guests are comfortable. But they also have the right to manage their own event. The guest in question didn't seem to make an effort to socialize despite being approached. The author tried to help but found the guest's behavior frustrating.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, hosting a party often involves managing social dynamics. If someone isn't contributing to the social aspect and is becoming a burden, the host might feel justified in asking them to leave. However, there's a line between being a social facilitator and being a social director. The author did attempt to integrate the guest, but when those efforts failed, they decided to remove him. \n\nBut wait, maybe the guest had social anxiety or was just shy. The author might have overstepped by not giving more time or support. On the other hand, the author isn't obligated to personally manage every guest's social needs. The key point is whether the author's response was reasonable given the situation. \n\nThe author's main argument is that they tried to help, but the guest wasn't making an effort. The coworker friend was upset, but the author explained their reasoning. It seems like the author acted within their rights as a host. However, some might argue that being a good host means being more forgiving. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often expect the host to be more accommodating. But this guest wasn't making an effort. So, the author might not be the asshole here. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong). But I should also consider cultural norms and typical expectations. In many cases, hosts aren't responsible for every guest's social success, especially if the guest is a plus one and not the main invitee. \n\nSo, after weighing both sides, the author's actions seem justified. They tried to help, but when the guest didn't reciprocate, they had the right to ask him to leave. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
