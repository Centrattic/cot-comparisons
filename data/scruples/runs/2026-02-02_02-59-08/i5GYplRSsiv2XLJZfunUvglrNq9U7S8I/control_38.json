I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about kicking someone out of a party for not socializing. Let me break down the details.\n\nThe person had a party, invited friends and coworkers. A guest came as a plus one, but not officially. The host noticed him standing around awkwardly. The host approached him, talked to him, introduced him to someone with similar interests. The guest then went back to being alone, said no one was talking to him again. The host tried suggesting activities and mingling, but the guest refused. The host then told him to leave if he's just going to stand there. The coworker (his friend) thought it was bad to tell him to leave, but the host explained it was because the guest wasn't making an effort.\n\nSo the question is whether the host is in the wrong. Let me consider the possible angles. On one hand, the host is the one who invited people and is hosting the event, so they might have the right to set boundaries. The guest was a plus one but maybe not the host's direct invite. The host made efforts to include the guest, but the guest didn't reciprocate. The host might feel responsible for the atmosphere and other guests' experience. If someone is not contributing to a social event and just wallowing in awkwardness, it could be disruptive.\n\nOn the other hand, the guest might have been genuinely uncomfortable, maybe introverted or not good in social settings. The host's approach might have been a bit harsh. Instead of kicking him out, maybe giving more time or finding another way to help him integrate. Also, the host might have overstepped by not allowing the guest to just be there quietly if that's what they wanted. Parties can be stressful, and not everyone is outgoing.\n\nBut the key points here are that the host tried to help, the guest refused to make any effort. The host's responsibility is to their own event and the comfort of other guests. If the guest was making the host uncomfortable or being uncooperative, then it's understandable. The coworker's friend might not have realized the context, but the host's reasoning seems valid. The host isn't obligated to baby-sit someone who isn't willing to socialize. So, the answer is probably B, the host isn't in the wrong. They made an effort to help, and when that failed, they had the right to ask someone to leave if they're not contributing to the party.\n"
