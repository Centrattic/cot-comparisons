I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" question is in the wrong for kicking out a guest who wasn't socializing.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The host had a party, and a guest who wasn't a direct invitee but came with a coworker was standing around looking awkward. The host tried to help by talking to him, introducing him to someone with similar interests, and suggesting activities. But the guest kept isolating himself. The host then told him to leave because he wasn't making an effort.\n\nNow, considering the details. The host did make attempts to include the guest. The guest, on the other hand, didn't engage when given opportunities. The host's party is their space, so they have the right to set boundaries. However, some might argue that the guest was uncomfortable and the host should have been more patient. But others might see the guest as not putting in effort, so the host was justified in enforcing party behavior.\n\nThe coworker friend of the guest said it was \"shitty\" to ask him to leave. But the host's perspective is that they can't be responsible for every guest's social interactions. Hosts often have to manage the environment for all attendees. If someone is not contributing to the social aspect and is possibly making others uncomfortable by being stand-offish, the host has a right to ask them to leave.\n\nI think the key points are: Did the host do enough to help the guest? Yes, they tried multiple times. Did the guest make an effort? No, he refused suggestions. Host's responsibility is to their own event. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
