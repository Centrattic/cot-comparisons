I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author did the right thing by kicking out the guest. The situation is that the person was invited as a plus one but came separately. He kept saying no one was talking to him, but the host tried to help by introducing him and suggesting activities. When he still didn't engage, the host asked him to leave.\n\nFirst, the guest was a plus one but didn't come with the coworker. That might have been a red flag. The host made efforts to include him twice, but he didn't respond. He kept complaining about being ignored despite being talked to. The host got annoyed because it seemed like the guest wanted others to make an effort for him, not himself. Then the host told him to leave.\n\nIs the host wrong? Well, the guest wasn't making an effort to socialize. The host tried to help, and when that failed, maybe it's reasonable to expect guests to take initiative. Parties are social events, so guests should participate. But maybe the host could have handled it more politely, like asking him to leave without making it public. Also, the coworker (his friend) might be upset, so perhaps the host should have talked to them first. But the host did explain their reasoning to the coworker later.\n\nOn the other hand, the guest might have had social anxiety or wasn't in the mood, but the host has the right to manage their own party. If someone is not contributing and making others uncomfortable, it's okay to ask them to leave. So maybe the host is in the right. Answer B.\n"
