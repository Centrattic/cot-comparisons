I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party for not socializing.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The host had a party with friends and coworkers. A guest, a friend of a coworker, came along. The host noticed he was standing around awkwardly and tried to help by talking to him and introducing him to others. But when the guest kept being isolated and refused to join activities, the host told him to leave. The coworker friend was upset about this.\n\nNow, considering the details: The host made efforts to help the guest integrate\u2014asked if he was okay, introduced him to someone with similar interests, suggested joining a game. The guest, however, didn't take initiative beyond what was offered. He kept saying no one was talking to him despite previous interactions. The host felt it was the guest's lack of effort and decided he could leave. The host also considered the time and energy they had for hosting.\n\nFrom the host's perspective, they were managing their own party and trying to be helpful. The guest's behavior might have been passive or expecting others to constantly accommodate him. The host's actions were a response to the guest's inaction and the host's own capacity to assist. \n\nPossible angles: Is it reasonable to expect guests to make an effort to socialize? Can a host set boundaries if a guest isn't contributing to socializing and is becoming a burden? The guest might not have social skills or felt anxious, but the host isn't required to force interactions. The host did try to help, and after repeated refusals, removing the guest isn't unreasonable. The coworker friend's reaction might be more about defending the guest rather than the host's responsibility.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the host has the right to manage their event. If someone isn't engaging and the host has done their part, it's not necessarily wrong to ask them to leave. So the answer might be B (No). But need to check if there's a nuance I'm missing. For example, was the guest clearly trying to be anti-social, or did the host overreact? The host's annoyance might be valid if the guest was resistant to socializing despite opportunities. The key is that the host tried to help, and the guest didn't respond. So the host isn't in the wrong here.\n"
