I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who hosted a party was wrong to kick out a guest for not socializing. The host noticed the guest was alone, tried to help by introducing him to someone, but the guest kept being alone and refused suggestions. The host then told him to leave, and the coworker (the guest's friend) thought it was bad. The user thinks the host is in the wrong but wants a second opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the host's perspective. Hosting a party comes with responsibility, but guests are also expected to contribute to the social environment. The host made efforts to include the guest, like talking to him and introducing him to others. The guest, however, didn't engage and might have been expecting others to approach him. The host might feel that after multiple attempts, the guest isn't making an effort, which could disrupt the party's atmosphere.\n\nOn the other hand, telling someone to leave can be harsh. The host might have better options, like asking the coworker to help. However, the guest was a plus one, not explicitly invited by the host, which might make it harder to manage. The line between being a good host and being accommodating is thin here. The host's main point is that the guest wasn't making an effort, so the host's action could be seen as enforcing social engagement. \n\nBut is it the host's responsibility to make every guest talk to others? The host isn't obligated to force interactions, but kicking someone out might be too extreme. Maybe a more diplomatic approach would be better. However, the guest was causing discomfort and not participating, which could affect the party. \n\nSo, the host tried to help, but the guest didn't reciprocate. The host's frustration is understandable. However, the act of kicking someone out might be seen as harsh. The coworker's friend might have social anxiety or other issues. But the host isn't a therapist. The key question is whether the host overstepped. \n\nIn similar situations, hosts often ask guests to be more social, but telling them to leave might be crossing a line. However, the host is also managing the event and their own comfort. It's a balancing act. I think the host isn't entirely wrong because the guest wasn't making an effort, but the method could be questioned. However, the question is if the host is in the wrong. If the answer is A, then yes they are wrong. If B, then no. Considering the host tried to help and the guest didn't respond, maybe the host wasn't wrong. So leaning towards B.\n"
