I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. So the question is whether the author was in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party for not socializing. Hmm.\n\nFirst, let's recap the situation. The author had a party and noticed a guest who was standing around alone. They tried to help by talking to him and introducing him to someone else. After a few attempts, the guest kept saying nobody was talking to him, even though he had interacted with someone. The author got annoyed and told him to leave. Now, the coworker friend thought it was shitty, but the author defended their decision because the guest wasn't making an effort.\n\nSo, what's the right approach here? Well, hosting a party means you have a responsibility to make guests feel comfortable, but there's also a limit to what you're obligated to do. If someone is making a conscious effort to engage but is being ignored, that's different. But in this case, the guest was given opportunities to socialize, like talking to the author, then the friend, and even being suggested to join a game. He declined both times. So maybe the author isn't entirely wrong here because the guest didn't take initiative.\n\nBut wait, is it the host's job to make sure every guest is included? If the guest is there as a plus one, maybe the host isn't responsible for their socializing. The coworker's friend was invited along, but if the host didn't know about him in advance, maybe that's a factor. However, the host did make an effort to help. \n\nOn the other hand, telling someone to leave because they weren't socializing could come off as harsh. Even if the host is busy, maybe there's a better way to handle it. But the guest was given multiple chances. The host's decision might be justified if they felt overwhelmed or if the guest was being passive. \n\nI think the key points are: Did the host make reasonable attempts to include the guest? Yes. Did the guest not take initiative? Yes. So maybe the host isn't in the wrong. But some might argue that it's unkind to ask someone to leave without exhausting all options. However, the host is allowed to set boundaries. So I'm leaning towards B (not in the wrong).\n"
