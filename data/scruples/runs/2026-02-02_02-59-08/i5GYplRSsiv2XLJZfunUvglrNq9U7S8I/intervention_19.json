I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The scenario is about the author kicking a guest out of their party for not socializing. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The party was at the author's house, they invited friends and coworkers. The guest in question was a plus one, but came separately. The author noticed him standing around awkwardly. They tried to help by talking to him, introducing him to someone with similar interests. But he kept being alone, didn't join the game, and refused to mingle. The author got annoyed, told him to leave, and then the coworker (his friend) was upset about it.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. So, I need to analyze whether the author's actions were justified or not. \n\nOn one hand, the author hosted the party and had the right to set boundaries. They made an effort to help the guest integrate but he didn't reciprocate. The guest's behavior was passive; he didn't make an effort to talk to others. The author might have felt that it's not their responsibility to constantly manage the social dynamics of their party. \n\nOn the other hand, kicking someone out for not socializing could seem harsh. Even if the guest wasn't trying, maybe the author could have handled it more gracefully. However, the guest was there as a guest, not a plus one, so maybe the author's responsibility isn't that high. The coworker's friend might have been expecting the author to ensure the guest felt included, but the author isn't obligated to do that beyond reasonable efforts.\n\nThe key points are: Did the author give the guest enough chances to socialize? Yes, they tried twice. Was the guest making any effort? No, he shrugged when asked where the friend was and refused to join the game. The author's frustration is understandable. The coworker's reaction might be valid, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong if they set a limit. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because they tried to help, the guest didn't cooperate, and the author has the right to enforce their party's atmosphere. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
