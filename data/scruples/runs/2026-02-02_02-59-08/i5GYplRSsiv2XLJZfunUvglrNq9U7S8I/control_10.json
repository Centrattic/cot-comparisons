I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

So, the situation is that the author hosted a party, and a guest (a plus one of a coworker) was standing around alone. The author tried to help by talking to him, introducing him to someone with similar interests, but the guest kept being alone again. The author then told him to leave because he wasn't making an effort.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the author's actions and intentions. The author tried to help the guest by engaging with him and introducing him to others. When the guest didn't take initiative to socialize further, the author got annoyed and told him to leave. The coworker (the guest's friend) thought it was bad to tell him to leave, but the author defended their decision.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The guest's behavior: he was uncomfortable, but he could have approached others. The author tried to help, but maybe the guest's expectations were too high. However, as the host, the author has the right to manage their party. If the guest was a problem or not contributing, the host can ask them to leave. The guest didn't make an effort, so maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But some might argue that the host should be more accommodating. However, it's the host's party, and they have the right to set boundaries. So the answer is probably B (author not in the wrong).\n"
