I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party because the guest wasn't socializing.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The host had a party, and a guest came along as a plus one but wasn't explicitly invited. The host noticed the guest was alone and tried to help by introducing him to someone. The guest then became isolated again and refused to engage when suggested. The host got annoyed and asked him to leave, which the guest did. The coworker (the plus one's friend) thought it was harsh, but the host explained their reasoning.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the host was wrong to ask the guest to leave. Let's consider different angles. \n\nHost's perspective: They organized the party and have the right to manage their space. If a guest is not contributing to the social environment and refuses to engage, it might be reasonable to ask them to leave. The host tried to help multiple times, but the guest didn't take initiative. The host might feel responsible for the comfort of all guests and not want someone who's disruptive or uninvolved to stay.\n\nGuest's perspective: The guest might feel they were excluded or awkward, which is understandable. However, the guest also didn't make an effort to join activities or talk to others. The host's attempts to help were met with resistance. The guest might argue that the host should have been more accommodating, but if they didn't take the initiative, maybe that's on them.\n\nSocial norms: Typically, hosts can set boundaries. If someone is not following the social cues and making an effort, it's acceptable to manage the situation. However, there's also a consideration for sensitivity towards people who might be shy or anxious. The line between being accommodating and being reasonable is important here.\n\nThe coworker called it \"shitty,\" but the host explained their reasoning. Maybe the coworker didn't see the context of the guest's behavior. The host's actions were based on repeated inaction from the guest despite help. \n\nLegally and ethically, the host owns the space and can ask anyone to leave. The key is whether the host's actions were justified. Since the guest was a plus one and not an official invitee, the host might have less obligation. The guest's behavior was passive-aggressive, expecting others to fix the problem instead of taking initiative.\n\nIn conclusion, the host isn't necessarily in the wrong. They tried helping, the guest didn't cooperate, and the host maintained control over their event. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
