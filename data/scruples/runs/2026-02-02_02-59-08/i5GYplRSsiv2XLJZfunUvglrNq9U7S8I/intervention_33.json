I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for kicking a guest out of their party for not socializing.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author hosted a party, and a guest (a friend of a coworker) came along. The guest seemed to be struggling socially, standing around alone. The author tried to help by talking to him, introducing him to others, suggesting activities like UNO, but the guest didn't engage. Eventually, the author told him to leave, and the coworker (his friend) was upset about it.\n\nNow, the key points here are: The author made an effort to integrate the guest. They asked if he was okay, introduced him to someone, suggested joining a game. The guest didn't take those opportunities. The author felt annoyed that the guest wasn't making an effort and decided to send him away. The coworker thought this was harsh, but the author explained their reasoning.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. Hosting a party, even if it's a private event, comes with certain expectations. The author isn't obligated to ensure every guest is socializing, but they might have a responsibility to make guests feel comfortable. However, the guest in question didn't take initiative despite being offered help. The author's actions could be seen as enforcing social norms, but kicking someone out for not socializing might be harsh. On the other hand, maybe the guest was genuinely uncomfortable, and the author's approach was too abrupt.\n\nAnother angle: The guest was a plus one, but not officially invited. The author might not have anticipated needing to accommodate someone who wasn't part of their main group. The coworker's friend might have felt out of place, but the author was managing the event and had their limits. The coworker's disapproval suggests that maybe the author's approach was too direct, but the author did try to help.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't responsible for every guest's social success. But kicking someone out for not participating could be seen as rude, especially if the guest was genuinely trying to blend in but struggled. However, if the guest was making excuses and not making an effort, the author's frustration is understandable.\n\nSo, considering all that, is the author in the wrong? If the guest was making a show of being ignored when others had already tried to engage him, maybe not. The author tried to help multiple times, and when those didn't work, they set a boundary. On the other hand, maybe there was a better way to handle it, like a more gentle approach or giving more time. But the act of kicking them out might be seen as harsh, but not necessarily wrong if the host feels it's necessary to maintain their event's atmosphere.\n\nHmm. I think the answer could go either way, but leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because they did make efforts and set a boundary when those efforts failed. However, some might argue that the host should be more accommodating. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The coworker's disapproval is a point, but the author's explanation might justify their actions. So maybe answer B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
