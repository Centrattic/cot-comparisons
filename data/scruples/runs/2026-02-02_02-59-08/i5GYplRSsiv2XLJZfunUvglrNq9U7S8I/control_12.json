I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who organized the party was wrong to kick out a guest for not socializing. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The guest was a plus-one but not officially invited. The host tried to help him integrate by talking to him and introducing him to someone else. The guest kept saying no one was talking to him even after interactions. He refused to join activities when suggested. The host got annoyed and asked him to leave because he wasn't making an effort.\n\nNow, thinking about social norms. It's common for parties to have people who are shy or awkward. The host tried a few times to assist. But the guest didn't reciprocate the effort. However, is it the host's responsibility to ensure every guest is socializing? Maybe not. But the host is the one hosting their own space. If someone is causing discomfort or being disruptive, the host has the right to ask them to leave. \n\nBut wait, the guest wasn't disruptive, just not socializing. The host's main issue was the guest not making an effort. The guest might have had social anxiety or other reasons. Did the host give enough time and options? They tried twice. Then offered to join a game, which was refused. So maybe the host was within their rights to ask him to leave if they felt it was affecting the party's vibe. \n\nOn the other hand, could the host have handled it more gracefully? Maybe not kicking him out but asking him to leave. But the host was firm. The coworker friend was upset, but the host explained their reasoning. \n\nIn terms of accountability, the guest didn't make an effort, so the host isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have the right to enforce some level of social engagement if it's impacting the event. So the answer is B.\n"
