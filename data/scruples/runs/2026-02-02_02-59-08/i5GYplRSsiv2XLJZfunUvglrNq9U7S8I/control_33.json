I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they had a party, and a guest who was a plus one started feeling left out. The author tried to help by introducing him to someone, but after a couple of times, the guest was still standing alone. The author got annoyed and told him to leave. The coworker who was his friend thought it was shitty to ask him to leave, but the author defended themselves by saying the guest wasn't making an effort.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms here. Hosting a party comes with certain expectations. The host is responsible for the atmosphere and the comfort of the guests, but there's a balance. If a guest is genuinely struggling to socialize, maybe the host should try to help more. But if the guest isn't making an effort themselves, the host might feel justified in asking them to leave if they're disruptive.\n\nThe guest in question was invited as a plus one but came separately. That might not be the host's fault. The host tried to engage him twice. The first time, they talked and introduced him. Then, when he was alone again, they suggested a game and mingling, which he refused. The host might feel that after multiple attempts to help, the guest is not reciprocating. \n\nBut then, is it wrong to expect someone to make an effort at a social gathering? Parties require some level of social engagement. If someone is there but just stands around, not trying to interact despite being offered help, the host might feel it's their right to ask them to leave if they're not contributing to the party's vibe. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the host should have been more patient, maybe even given more time for the guest to adapt. Also, the guest might have social anxiety or other personal issues that make it hard for them to engage. The host might not be aware of that. However, the guest's behavior here seems like they're not making any effort, just expecting others to approach them.\n\nThe coworker's reaction that it's \"shitty\" to ask him to leave could depend on their perspective. If the coworker feels their friend was treated unfairly, they might side with him. But the host's perspective is that they tried to help and couldn't take responsibility for the guest's lack of initiative.\n\nSo, breaking it down: The host made efforts to include the guest, but the guest didn't reciprocate. The host had the right to ask them to leave if they were making them uncomfortable. The key factors are the host's reasonable attempts to assist and the guest's lack of effort. The host isn't obligated to force socialization. Therefore, the answer might be that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
