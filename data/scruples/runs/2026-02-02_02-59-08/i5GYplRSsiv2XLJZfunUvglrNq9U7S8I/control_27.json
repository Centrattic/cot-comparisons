I invited a few friends and coworkers over for some drinks, games and food. One particular guest was sort of a plus one, but not really. He was the friend of a coworker that had invited him along, but they came to the party separately. I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him. Then, I introduced him to a friend of mine who had similar interests. They chatted for a bit, but 5 minutes later, I saw him standing alone again. I asked what\u2019s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say \u201cHi\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to see what\u2019s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they\u2019re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he\u2019s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn\u2019t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn\u2019t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people. AITA for this?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a party where they kicked out a guest for not socializing. The guest was a plus one, not officially invited, and came with a coworker. The author tried to help him by talking to him, introducing him to friends, and suggesting activities like playing uno. But the guest kept standing alone and refused to mingle. The author got annoyed and told him to leave. The coworker (his friend) was upset about it.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the guest was a plus one, which might mean he wasn't part of the main invite. The author made efforts to include him, but he didn't reciprocate. The guest kept complaining about not being talked to, but when given opportunities, he didn't engage. The author felt it was his responsibility to manage the party and maintain the environment, so they asked him to leave.\n\nIs it wrong to kick out someone who isn't trying to socialize? Well, the author hosted the party, so they do have some authority over the environment. However, the guest was a plus one, so maybe the coworker should have been responsible for their guest. The author tried to be helpful, but when the guest refused to participate, it's possible that the author had the right to ask them to leave to prevent the guest from disrupting the party or making others uncomfortable.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have handled it more kindly. But the guest was not making an effort, and the author explained their reasoning to the coworker. It seems like a reasonable response to the situation. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. So the answer is B.\n"
