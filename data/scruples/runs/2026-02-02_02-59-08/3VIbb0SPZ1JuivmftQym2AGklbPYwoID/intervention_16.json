I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for wanting to move out and leave his sister. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author's mom is pregnant. She initially decides to have an abortion but then changes her mind, using the author's money to buy baby items. The author had given her money to help with the abortion, but she spent it all on baby stuff instead. Then, after he turned 18, he moved his money to a separate account, which made his mom upset. She accused him of being selfish and expects him to help raise the baby. Now, he's considering moving out to avoid this responsibility.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about responsibility, trust, and family obligations. The author is struggling financially, working to support himself and his mom, and now there's a new baby on the way. His mom's decision to have the baby without considering their financial situation might be a big part of this. The author is trying to take control of his own life and future, which is understandable. He's in school, trying to improve his grades, and saving for college. Moving out could help him focus on his education and reduce his financial burden from supporting his mom and the new baby.\n\nOn the other hand, family responsibilities can be complex. The author's mom might feel that he, as the older brother, should help. But if the mother is the legal guardian and parent, shouldn't she be the one taking primary responsibility for the child? The author isn't a parent, so maybe he's not obligated to help raise the baby. Also, the mother's actions\u2014like using his money without permission and then changing her mind about the abortion\u2014show a lack of trust and responsibility. The author's decision to move out seems like a way to set boundaries and protect his own future.\n\nBut wait, is moving out abandoning his family? The question is whether he's in the wrong. The mother is the parent; the author isn't a parent. So he's not legally responsible for the baby. He's also in a tough spot financially and academically. If he stays, he might not be able to focus on his education, which is crucial for his future. Moving out could be a reasonable step to take control of his life. However, the emotional aspect is there\u2014leaving his sister when they're in a difficult situation. But maybe the sister is an adult now? Wait, the post says \"baby sister,\" so the new child is the author's sibling. The author is the older brother, but he's not the parent. So he's not legally responsible to support the baby. His mom is.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. He's trying to protect his own future and set boundaries after being taken advantage of. His mom's actions led to the situation, and moving out is a way to avoid further conflict and support his goals. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
