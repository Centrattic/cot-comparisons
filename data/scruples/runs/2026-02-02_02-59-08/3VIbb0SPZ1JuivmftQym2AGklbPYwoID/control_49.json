I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the person is an older sibling whose mom got pregnant and initially decided to have an abortion after financial discussions. The author contributed money for the abortion, but then the mom changed her mind, spent the money on baby stuff, and now is accusing the brother of being selfish for not supporting the baby. The brother is considering moving out because he doesn't trust his mom with his money anymore and wants to focus on his education and work.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mom is not working and the brother is the main financial support. The mother's boyfriend left after the pregnancy announcement, which added stress. The brother helped with the abortion cost but then his mom spent all the money on baby items after changing her mind. That's a big betrayal. The brother has a right to feel taken advantage of, especially since he's trying to save for college and support himself.\n\nThe mom's argument that it's the brother's responsibility as a sibling might not hold up. Legally, there's no obligation for a sibling to support a family member unless there's a court order, but this is more about family dynamics. The brother is an adult now, and moving out could be his way of taking control of his life. However, there's a moral aspect: does he have a duty to help his sister? But the mom is the parent; shouldn't the parents be responsible for their children? The brother is trying to prioritize his future, which is understandable.\n\nThe mother's actions\u2014taking his money without permission, making decisions that affect the household's finances without considering the consequences\u2014are problematic. The brother is setting boundaries, which is healthy. Moving out isn't just about the baby; it's about the ongoing issue of financial trust and his own well-being. The brother's GPA is low but improving, and he's working hard. He might need the stability of living independently to focus on his education.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that abandoning family in a difficult time is selfish. But the brother has been the primary support, and now the mother is imposing more responsibilities on him. He's not in the wrong for wanting to protect his future. The mother's reaction is hostile, and the brother is trying to assert his independence, which is a common transition for adults.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. He's standing up for himself after being taken advantage of and trying to secure his future. The answer should be B.\n"
