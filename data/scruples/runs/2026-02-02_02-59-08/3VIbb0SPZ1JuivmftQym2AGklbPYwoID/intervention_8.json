I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The author, who we'll call the brother, is in a difficult family situation. His dad left when he was 3, he's not doing great in school with a 2.5 GPA, works after school, and is trying to save for college. His mom is unemployed and just got pregnant. She quits her job because she says it's not good for the baby, which causes tension because they can barely make ends meet. The brother and his mom get into an argument, and eventually, the mom decides to have an abortion, but then changes her mind, uses the brother's money for baby items, and now the brother is considering moving out.\n\nFirst, let's look at the brother's actions. He initially tried to reason with his mom about the financial implications of keeping the baby, which makes sense given their financial situation. He even contributed money towards the abortion, which was then misused by his mom. The mom then changed her decision, which is a big deal, especially since it goes against the initial agreement. The brother feels that he can't trust his mom with his money anymore, especially since she's taken money from their joint account before. After turning 18, he moved the money to his own account. When confronted, the mom accuses him of being selfish, and the brother is now considering moving out.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, moving out as an adult is a personal choice. He's 18, so legally he's an adult, and he's trying to take care of his future and education. The mom is making decisions that put a strain on their already tight finances, and she's not being responsible with the money they have. The brother is trying to protect his future, which is understandable. However, abandoning family in a time of need could be seen as selfish, but he's also in a tough spot financially and academically. The mom's actions, like using his money for baby items after promising to abort, are questionable. So, while the brother is making a decision that benefits him, it's in response to the mom's poor financial management and lack of responsibility. \n\nThere's also the aspect of responsibility. The brother isn't obligated to support his sister, especially if he feels that his mom is not capable of being a responsible parent. The mom's behavior, including changing her mind and misusing funds, could be contributing to his decision to move out. However, the brother should consider if he's leaving the mom in a worse position. But given that the mom is already making decisions without considering the financial impact, maybe the brother is justified in prioritizing his own needs.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the brother is not necessarily in the wrong. He's an adult trying to make the best decision for his future, especially when his family isn't managing their responsibilities well. The answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
