I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to move out and leave his responsibilities with his sister and mom. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author's mom gets pregnant and quits her job. The boyfriend threatens to leave unless she aborts, but she decides to keep the baby after initially considering an abortion she can't afford. The author helped with the abortion cost, but his mom used his money for baby items instead. Then, when he turns 18, he pulls his money out of a joint account to keep it safe. Now, he's thinking of moving out to focus on his education and not take on more parental responsibility.\n\nHmm, the main points here are financial responsibility and personal boundaries. The author is trying to take care of his future, but his mom is making decisions that impact their financial stability. The mom is using his money without permission, which is a big deal. Also, she's expecting him to help raise the baby even though they've barely been able to get by before. The author's GPA isn't great, but he's improving, and working a lot. Moving out might give him the space to focus on school and his career, which he's struggling with now because of the family situation.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. The key factors are the mom's actions\u2014using his money, quitting her job, the boyfriend situation, and the baby. The author isn't being selfish; he's trying to protect his future. He's already supporting them financially and can't take on more. Moving out could be a way to set boundaries, especially after the mom's misuse of his funds. However, there's a moral obligation to help family, but if the parent is irresponsible, maybe the child isn't obligated. The author's reasoning is that he can't trust his mom with his money and won't be able to handle the added responsibility. So, considering all that, the answer might be B, he's not in the wrong. The mom's actions are contributing to the situation, and the author is trying to protect his own future.\n"
