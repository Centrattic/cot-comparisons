I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to move out and refuse helping with the baby sister. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the author's mom is pregnant, and they have financial struggles. The mom initially decides to have an abortion with the author's help but then changes her mind, using his money for baby items. The author has a strained relationship with his mom and wants to move out to focus on school and his future. \n\nSo, from the author's perspective, he's trying to take control of his life, especially since he's responsible for his own education and work. He's been helping his mom financially, but now he's fed up with her decisions and her taking his money without permission. Moving out could be a way to set boundaries and protect his resources. \n\nOn the other hand, the mother argues that as an older sibling, it's the author's responsibility to help. But the author points out that they were already struggling financially and that the mother made decisions without considering the impact on him. The mother's actions, like taking money from the joint account and then using it for the baby, might have contributed to the author's decision to move out. \n\nLegally, the author is an adult now, so he's allowed to move out. The ethical question is more about responsibility. Is he selfish for leaving, or is he justified in wanting to protect his own future? The mother's poor financial decisions and lack of accountability might make the author's decision more understandable. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong. He's trying to prioritize his well-being and future, especially after the mother's actions have been irresponsible. But it's a tough call because family responsibilities can be a factor. However, the author's right to autonomy and self-preservation is a strong point here.\n"
