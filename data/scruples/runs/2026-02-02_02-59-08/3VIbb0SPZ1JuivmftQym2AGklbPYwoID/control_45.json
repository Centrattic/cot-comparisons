I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for moving out and refusing to support his baby sister. The scenario is pretty complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the family situation: the author's dad left when he was 3, so he's been dealing with that. He's not close to his mom and makes more than her, but they're just getting by. His GPA is 2.5, but he's working after school and improving. His mom got pregnant, which caused financial strain because she was going to quit her job. The boyfriend wanted an abortion but she decided to keep the baby after initially getting the abortion pill and spending the money on baby items. The author was supposed to help pay for the abortion but his mom used his money for baby stuff instead. Now, he's considering moving out because he can't trust her with his money and feels he'll be dumped with parenting responsibilities.\n\nSo, the key points here are the financial responsibilities, the mother's decisions, and the author's response. The author is in a tough spot. He's trying to save for college and improve his grades, but the new baby would add more stress. His mom's actions, like draining his account and changing her mind about the abortion, are clearly problematic. The author is 18 and has the means to move out now.\n\nOn one hand, the author is not legally obligated to support his sister. As an adult, he's not required to financially support his mother or siblings. The mother's behavior\u2014using his money without consent, making rash decisions that affect their financial stability\u2014could justify his decision to move out. He's trying to focus on his education and future, which is important. The mother's outburst about it being his responsibility as a big brother might be emotionally manipulative, given her own role in the situation.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that as a sibling, he has a moral obligation to help his family, especially since they were in a difficult situation. However, the mother's actions have been irresponsible: quitting her job, using his money against his wishes, and then changing her mind. The author has already taken steps to protect his finances by moving money to a separate account. His decision to move out is a way to take control of his life and avoid being burdened further.\n\nIt's also important to consider the emotional aspect. The author has a strained relationship with his mom and a history of financial issues. Moving out might be a necessary step for his well-being. The mother's behavior seems to prioritize her own desires without considering the financial impact on her son. The author's actions are self-preservation, which is understandable.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't in the wrong because he's making a choice to protect his future and financial stability. The mother's decisions were the root of the problem. The author's responsibility as a sibling is more moral than legal, and given the circumstances, moving out is a justified action. The answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
