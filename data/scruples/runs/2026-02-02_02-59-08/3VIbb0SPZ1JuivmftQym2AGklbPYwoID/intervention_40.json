I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering moving out and leaving their sister. The situation is pretty complicated.\n\nFirst, the author's mom got pregnant, which added financial strain. The author tried to reason with her to abort because they couldn't afford another child. The mom agreed and got the abortion, but then changed her mind, using the author's money for baby items. The author is now considering moving out because they feel overwhelmed and don't trust their mom anymore.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author is an adult now, having turned 18, and is trying to take control of their life. They have the means to move out, which they see as a way to focus on their education and not be burdened by their mom's decisions. However, their mom is expecting them to help raise the sister, which the author refuses. \n\nOn one hand, parents do have a responsibility to care for their children, including any new siblings. The mom might be struggling, but the author is being asked to take on a role that's typically the parents'. The author feels it's unfair, especially after the financial betrayal. But on the other hand, the author is in a tough spot, dealing with their own struggles and not wanting to be financially responsible for another person. \n\nLegally, the author isn't obligated to help raise their sister. However, emotionally and socially, there's an expectation of family support. But given the mom's actions\u2014like using the author's money without permission and the history of financial instability\u2014it's understandable why the author wants out. \n\nIt's a mix of personal responsibility and family dynamics. The author isn't in the wrong legally, but morally, it's a gray area. They're prioritizing their own well-being, which is important, especially when the parent isn't fulfilling their role. So the answer might be B, but I need to be sure.\n"
