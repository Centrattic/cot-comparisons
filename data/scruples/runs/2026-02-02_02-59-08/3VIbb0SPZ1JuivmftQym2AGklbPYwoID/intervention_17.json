I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the post is in the wrong for considering moving out and leaving his baby sister. The situation is pretty complicated.\n\nFirst, the author's mom had a pregnancy, and he helped pay for an abortion, but she changed her mind and kept the baby. Then she spent his saved money on baby items without his consent. He's been taking care of their finances, and now he feels overwhelmed. He's struggling in school, working, and now this new responsibility might be too much. He wants to move out to focus on himself and his education.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's break it down. On one hand, he's a young adult trying to improve his life, and his mother's actions have added unexpected stress. He had to step in to help with the abortion cost, but she didn't follow through on that. Now she's spending his money without permission, which he's not okay with. Moving out could be seen as a way to take control of his life, especially since he's making more than his mom and has his own goals.\n\nOn the other hand, he's being called selfish by his mom. But is he really in the wrong? He's trying to protect his resources for education and independence. His sister is his baby sibling, but he's not a parent; his mom is. She made the choice to have the baby despite his concerns, and now he's taking responsibility for his own future. The fact that his mom has a history of misusing his money adds to his justification for moving out. He's also in a difficult financial situation, and the new sibling could make things worse for him.\n\nBut maybe there's a middle ground. Is there a way he could help without moving out entirely? However, given the circumstances\u2014he's already supporting both of them, and now with a new baby, it's unsustainable. The mother's irresponsible actions, like quitting her job and spending his money, contribute to his decision. He's not abandoning them; he's moving out to focus on his education and future, which is a valid choice for an adult.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong. His actions are about self-preservation and financial responsibility. Moving out is a personal choice, especially when he's in a position to do so. The mother's behavior has pushed him to this point. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
