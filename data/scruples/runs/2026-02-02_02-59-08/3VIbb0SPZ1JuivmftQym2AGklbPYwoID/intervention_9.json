I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for considering moving out and leaving his sister. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author's mom is pregnant, but she can't work because she's quitting her job. The boyfriend was involved but then left after the mom decided to keep the baby. The author initially helped pay for an abortion but his mom used the money for baby stuff and then changed her mind. There's a history of her taking money from their joint account without permission. Now the author is thinking of moving out to focus on his education and independence.\n\nSo, the main points here are responsibility, trust issues, and the author's well-being. The mom's actions have caused financial strain and unpredictability. The author is trying to take control of his life, which is understandable. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong by leaving his family in this situation.\n\nOn one hand, the author is taking responsibility for his own future and is in a tough spot financially and academically. He's not in a position to support another child, and his mom's decisions have already caused problems. Moving out might be a necessary step for his personal growth and stability.\n\nOn the other hand, family responsibilities can be a factor. But given the context\u2014his mom's history of financial irresponsibility, the boyfriend's exit, and the author's own struggles\u2014it's clear that staying might hinder his ability to improve his situation. Also, the author isn't abandoning his sister entirely; he's just prioritizing his own needs and future, which he can't control if he's in the same household.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's decision to move out seems justified as a self-preservation step. He's not in the wrong because he's trying to protect his own future and well-being amidst a challenging family situation. The mom's actions have contributed to the need for him to leave, so it's more about taking control rather than being selfish.\n"
