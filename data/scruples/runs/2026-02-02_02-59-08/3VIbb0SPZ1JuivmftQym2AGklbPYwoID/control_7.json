I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if the author (their friend) is in the wrong for considering moving out and refusing to support his sister. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the family dynamics. The mom and dad: dad left when the author was 3. Now, the mom is pregnant with an unemployed partner. The author is working and making more than his mom, but together they just manage. His GPA is 2.5, which he's trying to improve. He's saving for college. So he's in a tough spot financially and academically.\n\nThen the mom announces her pregnancy, quits her job, and her boyfriend threatens to leave unless she aborts. The author and his mom argue, he yells, but she ends up getting an abortion with his help. But then she takes the money he contributed, spends it on baby items, and changes her mind, deciding to keep the baby. The mom then accuses him of being selfish when he stops trusting her with money. He's considering moving out to focus on his education and not have to support the family.\n\nSo, the question is: is the author in the wrong? \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in the US, parents are responsible for their children until they turn 18. The author is an adult now (since he moved out after turning 18, as he had to take control of his bank account). But the sister is a baby, so the mother is responsible for her. However, the author is a minor sibling now? Wait, the original post mentions that when he was a minor, he had a joint account. Now he's 18, so the sister is a newborn. The author is an adult, but he's still in school and working. \n\nThe mother's actions: she initially gets the abortion with his help, then spends the money on baby items and keeps the baby. She's not working, and her boyfriend left. The author is essentially the main financial support. He's been helping before, but now he doesn't trust her after the money incident. \n\nIs it the author's responsibility to help? Legally, no. Once he's 18, he's an adult. Parents aren't required to support adult children, and vice versa. However, in this case, the mother is the one who should be taking care of the baby. But she's unemployed and relying on the author. He's in a tough spot where his own future is at risk because he's trying to balance work, school, and potential financial support. \n\nThe mother's argument that it's the author's responsibility as a sibling is not legally binding, but maybe culturally or morally? But in most cases, siblings aren't legally obligated to support each other. So the author has a right to prioritize his own future. \n\nHe's been supporting them before because they were struggling, but now with the new baby, the situation is worse. He's justified in wanting to move out, especially since he's an adult. The mother's actions (taking his money, changing her mind) show she can't be trusted, so he's not in the wrong for not trusting her. \n\nSo the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
