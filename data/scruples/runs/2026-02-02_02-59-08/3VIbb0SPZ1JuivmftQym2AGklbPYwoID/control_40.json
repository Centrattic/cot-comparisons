I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for considering moving out and refusing to support his sister after his mom's actions. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's mom got pregnant again, which was a big financial burden. They had already been struggling with rent and his job. The mom initially considered an abortion but then changed her mind, using the money he contributed for the abortion to buy baby stuff instead. The author doesn't trust her financially anymore and feels like he's being forced to support the baby. He's considering moving out to focus on his education and independence.\n\nSo, the main points are: financial strain, lack of trust due to past actions, the mom's decisions affecting their stability, and the author wanting to move out. \n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. Legal responsibility as a sibling? Not really. Parents are responsible for their children, not the other way around. The author is trying to take care of his own future, education, and financial stability. \n\nThe mom is the one making decisions that impact their financial situation without considering the consequences. The author isn't obligated to support his sister, especially given the mom's irresponsibility. \n\nHowever, some might argue that as a sibling, he has a moral duty to help. But given the circumstances\u2014his own struggles, the mom's actions, and his need to focus on college\u2014it's more about self-preservation. \n\nAlso, the fact that he's trying to save for college and improve his grades shows he's planning for his future. Moving out would allow him to do that without the added stress of supporting his family's financial burdens. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
