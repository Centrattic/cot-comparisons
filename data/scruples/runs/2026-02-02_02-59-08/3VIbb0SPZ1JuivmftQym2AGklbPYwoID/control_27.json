I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the question is whether he's justified in refusing to help his baby sister and moving out. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author's mom is pregnant again. He and his mom already have a strained relationship. His dad left when he was three, and they're barely making ends meet. The mom decides to quit her job because the pregnancy isn't good for her, but then later she changes her mind and decides to keep the baby after getting an abortion. The author helped pay for the abortion but then found out his mom used his money to buy baby stuff, which made him lose trust. Now, he wants to move out to avoid being financially responsible for the new sibling, which he feels he can't handle. The mom is angry, saying it's his responsibility as a big brother. The author is considering just walking out.\n\nSo, the key points here are financial responsibility, trust issues, and the mother's decisions. The author is worried about his own education and future. He's already struggling with school and work, and adding another child might push him over the edge. His mom's actions\u2014like using his money without permission\u2014show a lack of trust and responsibility, which he can't ignore. He's trying to take control of his life and finances now that he's 18, which is his right.\n\nBut on the other hand, the mother might feel that the author, as an adult, should help. However, legally and morally, the parent is responsible for the child, not the older sibling. The author isn't a parent, so he isn't obligated to support the new baby. The mother's decision to keep the baby despite the financial instability and her previous actions (draining his account) might make it reasonable for the author to distance himself to protect his own future.\n\nHe's also in a tough spot with his education. Moving out might give him the space he needs to focus on school and secure his future. The mom's threats and anger suggest that the environment isn't healthy for him either. So, the author's decision to move out is more about self-preservation and taking responsibility for his own life, which is understandable. He's not abandoning his sister entirely; he's just not taking on the financial burden of the new baby, which isn't his responsibility. Therefore, the answer is B\u2014he's not in the wrong.\n"
