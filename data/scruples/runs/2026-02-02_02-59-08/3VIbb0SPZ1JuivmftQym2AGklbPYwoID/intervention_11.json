I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's mom got pregnant and initially decided to have an abortion after the author helped pay for it. But then the mom changed her mind, kept the baby, and spent the author's money on baby stuff. The author feels he can't trust her anymore and wants to move out.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the responsibilities here. The mom is an adult, but she's making decisions that affect her son. The author is helping financially, but he's also a student and working. He's worried about his future and education. The mom, on the other hand, has a history of taking money without permission, which the author can't trust now that he's an adult.\n\nThe author's main argument is that he can't support another person, especially when his mom is unreliable. He's trying to focus on his education and his own stability. Moving out seems like a way to take control of his life. But is he being selfish? Well, he's not the parent, but he's been helping financially. The mom's actions\u2014like using his money for baby items without asking\u2014seem inconsiderate. \n\nThe mom's response, yelling about it being the author's responsibility as a brother, might be a stretch. Parental responsibility usually falls on the parents, not siblings. The author isn't obligated to support the baby. Plus, the mom had already chosen to abort but changed her mind. That backtracking might have been a mistake. \n\nConsidering the author's age and financial situation, he's trying to secure his future. Moving out to focus on his studies and work without financial strain makes sense. The mom's poor financial decisions and lack of trustworthiness with money are key factors here. The author isn't abandoning his sister; he's prioritizing his own stability. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It seems like he's making a self-preservation choice. The mom's actions have led to this point. The author isn't legally responsible for the baby, and the mom's behavior justifies his decision to move out. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
