I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to support their baby sister and moving out. So, the situation involves the author's mom getting pregnant with an unemployed boyfriend, then quitting her job, leading to financial strain. The author tried to help pay for the abortion but the mom spent the money on baby items and then decided to keep the baby. Now the author wants to move out because they can't handle the responsibility.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the family dynamics. The mom and dad split when the author was three, so they might have a strained relationship. The author is working and saving for college, but their GPA is low. They're in a tough spot financially. The mom's boyfriend was supposed to support the baby but left, and she spent the author's money on baby things despite the author's earlier help with the abortion. That seems like a breach of trust.\n\nThe author's main reason for moving out is the lack of trust. They mentioned that the mom took money from the joint account before, even when they were a minor. Now, with the mom insisting on their responsibility as a big brother, the author feels pressured. They have the means to move out, which would allow them to focus on education and work less. \n\nLegally, the author is an adult now, so they have the right to manage their own finances. The mom's actions in draining the account without permission are problematic. The author's decision to move out is about self-preservation and not being taken advantage of. However, ethically, there's a debate about family responsibility. The author is the eldest and might feel a moral duty to help, but if the mom isn't reliable, maybe that duty isn't there. \n\nThe mom's behavior shows a lack of accountability. She changed her mind after using the author's money, leading to the author's distrust. The author's frustration is understandable, especially with their own goals in mind. Moving out to avoid being a financial burden to themselves and to focus on education might be justified. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that as a sibling, the author has a responsibility to help, especially with the mom's history. But the author has already supported them financially, and the mom didn't follow through. The author's boundaries are important here. \n\nSo considering all that, the answer would be B (No), because the author is setting boundaries to protect themselves and their future, especially after the mom's actions. The mom is the one who changed her decision and misused the funds, so the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their own well-being.\n"
