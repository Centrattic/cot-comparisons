I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for moving out and refusing to support his baby sister. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author's mom got pregnant with his baby sister. Initially, she decided to have an abortion, but then changed her mind. The author had given money for the abortion, but she used it for baby items instead. Now, he's considering moving out to avoid supporting the child.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. Let's look at the key points.\n\nThe mom's actions: She changed her mind about the abortion, used the author's money for baby items, and is now expecting him to help. The author has a 2.5 GPA, works part-time, and is struggling financially. His dad left when he was 3. He's saving for college and trying to improve his grades. Moving out would let him focus on school without financial strain.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, does the author have a responsibility to support his sister? In many cultures, family responsibilities are expected, especially between siblings. However, the mother's decisions have created this situation. She used the author's money without permission, which is a breach of trust. Also, she's choosing to have the child despite financial instability, which the author tried to warn her about.\n\nThe author's reasoning: He's making a choice to take care of his own future. College is important for his career, and he's already under financial stress. By moving out, he can focus on education and not have to support a child he didn't choose to have. His mom's actions have contributed to the problem, and he's trying to regain control of his life.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that as an older brother, he has a duty to help his family, even if the mother made bad decisions. But the mother's actions were self-centered. She used his funds against his wishes and is now expecting him to take responsibility. That's not fair.\n\nLegally, in most places, parents are responsible for their children, not siblings. So the author isn't legally obligated to help. The mother's boyfriend, who was supposed to support her, abandoned them. The author doesn't have a legal or moral obligation to step in, especially since the mother is the one who made the choices. \n\nThe mother's behavior seems selfish. She initially wanted an abortion but changed her mind. Then she took the author's money without consent. The author is protecting his future by moving out. His GPA isn't great, but he's improving. Moving out could give him the space to focus on education and his job without the added stress of supporting a newborn.\n\nIn summary, the author is not in the wrong. He's acting in his own best interest after his mother's irresponsible actions. The mother's choices led to this situation, and the author is trying to regain control of his life. So the answer should be B.\n"
