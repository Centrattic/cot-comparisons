I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe person is an older brother whose mom just had a baby. The family is already struggling financially. The mom initially wanted an abortion but then changed her mind and kept the baby. The brother helped pay for the abortion but then found out his mom used his money for baby stuff. He's been having issues with her before, taking small amounts when he was a minor. Now he's 18, moved the money to his own account, and is considering moving out because he doesn't trust his mom and can't handle being responsible for the baby.\n\nSo the question is whether he's in the wrong for moving out. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, family responsibilities. The mom is pregnant, but she made a choice to have the baby after initially considering an abortion. The brother helped pay for the abortion, but then the mom used his money for baby items when she decided to keep it. The brother feels he can't trust her with money anymore and is worried about being forced to support the baby. He's also struggling with his education and work.\n\nThe mom's argument is that as a parent, it's the brother's responsibility to help raise the baby. But does that hold up legally? Legally, parents are responsible for their children, not siblings. Unless there's a court order or some other legal obligation, siblings aren't required to support each other. So the mom can't legally force the brother to take on parental responsibilities.\n\nEmotionally, the brother is under a lot of stress. He's trying to save for college, working, and his grades are suffering. The mom's actions\u2014using his money without permission and then changing her mind\u2014add to his stress. Moving out could be a way for him to take control of his life and focus on his future.\n\nHowever, some might argue that as a sibling, he has a moral obligation to help his family, especially since they're in a tough spot. But given the situation where the mother is the parent and is supposed to be the primary caregiver, the brother's need to protect his own financial stability and future is also valid. He's already contributing as much as he can, and the mother is the one who made the decision to keep the baby, which now puts more strain on the family. If the mother can't handle the responsibility and is relying on the son, maybe she should have considered that before deciding to have the baby.\n\nAlso, the mother's actions of taking money without permission, even when he was a minor, show a pattern of financial irresponsibility. The brother moving out is a way to set boundaries and protect his own resources, which is understandable. He's not in the wrong for wanting to take care of himself when the parent isn't managing the situation responsibly.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the brother isn't in the wrong. He's trying to secure his future and is not legally obligated to support the baby. The mother's behavior has contributed to the conflict, and moving out is a reasonable step for him to take.\n"
