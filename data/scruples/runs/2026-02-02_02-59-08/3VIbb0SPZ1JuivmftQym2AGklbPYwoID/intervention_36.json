I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for considering moving out and refusing to support his baby sister.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's mom became pregnant, which adds financial strain. They were already struggling, and the mom initially agreed to an abortion but then changed her mind. The author contributed money for the abortion, but the mom used it for baby items instead. The author feels exploited and wants to move out to focus on his education and future. The mom is now demanding he help raise the child.\n\nSo, the main points are: financial responsibility, trust issues, and the author's desire for independence. The author isn't in a good situation financially and has his own goals. He's tried to help but feels taken advantage of. The mom's actions (changing her mind, taking his money) have broken his trust.\n\nNow, considering the question: Is he in the wrong? The answer options are A (Yes) or B (No). I need to decide based on ethical reasoning. \n\nIn many cases, individuals have the right to make their own life choices, especially when they're in a harmful or unsustainable situation. The author is an adult now (he turned 18), so he's not legally obligated to support his sister. His parents have the legal responsibility. However, he's already contributing beyond what's expected, and his mom is now taking advantage of his past help. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, while family support is important, there's a limit. The author is prioritizing his own education and future stability, which is understandable. The mom's actions (withdrawing money without permission, changing her decision) have led to his distrust. Moving out to avoid being exploited further isn't necessarily selfish if it's about self-preservation and personal growth.\n\nHowever, some might argue that as a sibling, he has a moral duty to help. But the key here is that the mother is the primary parent responsible. The author isn't the parent; he's a sibling. The mother's failure to manage her own responsibilities doesn't automatically transfer that responsibility to him. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to move out to protect his own interests and future.\n"
