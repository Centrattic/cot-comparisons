I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong for refusing to support his baby sister and moving out. The context is a bit complex, so I need to consider all the factors.\n\nFirst, the author's background: he's in a strained relationship with his mother. His dad left when he was 3, and he's trying to manage his own education and work, making more than his mom but both are barely getting by financially. His GPA is 2.5, but he's improving and saving for college. So he's in a tough spot himself, balancing school and work, and trying to better his future.\n\nThen, the situation with the sister. The mom announces a pregnancy, quits her job, leading to financial strain. The author's reaction is understandable given their current state. The boyfriend initially threatened to leave unless she aborts, but the mom insists on keeping the baby and later changes her mind again. The author helps with the abortion cost, but his mom uses his money for baby items and then claims the baby anyway. This is a major betrayal. She took the money without consent, even though he had already expressed trust issues and tried to protect his funds after turning 18.\n\nThe key points here are the mother's actions. She's an adult making a decision, but she's putting the financial burden on her son, especially after he's tried to set boundaries. The author is in a position where he's already struggling with his own goals and responsibilities. By moving out, he's trying to take control of his life and not get dragged down by his family's financial instability. \n\nBut wait, is the author obligated to help? Legally, maybe not, since he's an adult. However, in some cultures or family dynamics, there might be an expectation of support. However, the mom's behavior\u2014changing her mind, using his money without permission, and yelling at him for not supporting\u2014shows a lack of respect for his boundaries and his own struggles. \n\nThe author's main argument is about not being able to trust his mom with his money and wanting to focus on his education. Moving out seems like a self-protective measure. It's his right to prioritize his future, especially when he's already in a difficult position. The mom's reaction of screaming and calling him selfish is also problematic because she's choosing to have a child and then expecting her son to take responsibility without his consent. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. He's standing up for himself after being taken advantage of. The mother's actions are irresponsible, and the author is trying to break free from a cycle of financial and emotional strain. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
