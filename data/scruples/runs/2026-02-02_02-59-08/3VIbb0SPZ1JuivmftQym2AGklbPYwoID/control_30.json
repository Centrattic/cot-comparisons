I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he's dealing with his mom who got pregnant, and they can't afford to support another child. He tried to convince her to have an abortion, she did for a while, then changed her mind again. She spent the money he gave for the abortion on baby stuff. Now he's thinking of moving out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider his reasons. He's not close with his mom, his dad left when he was three. He's working, trying to go to school with a 2.5 GPA, which he's improving. He's saving for college. His mom's new baby would add financial and emotional stress. He's already helping by giving most of his savings for the abortion, but she took the money and used it for baby things. Then she's yelling at him for not being supportive. \n\nHe mentions that he's moved all his money to a separate account to avoid her taking it again. He feels she's not responsible with money and might dump parenting duties on him. He wants to focus on his education and future without the added burden. \n\nSo, moving out seems like a way to protect his future. But is it wrong? Well, he's an adult now. In many places, parents don't have legal obligation to support their adult children, and vice versa unless there's a custody arrangement. However, since he's a sibling, there's an emotional and moral aspect. \n\nHis mom's argument is that as a big brother, it's his responsibility. But is that a valid claim? If she's the parent, isn't that her responsibility? He's already tried to help with the abortion money and now she's changed her mind. He can't trust her financially. \n\nHe might feel that he's not in a position to help her anymore. His priority is his education and his own future. Moving out could be seen as self-preservation. But maybe there's a middle ground, like setting boundaries instead of completely cutting ties. However, given the situation, he's already given money, and now he's being blamed for not being selfish. \n\nI think the key points are financial responsibility and his own well-being. He's not in a position to support another person, especially with his academic goals. His mom's actions (changing her mind about the abortion, using the money, yelling) don't help his decision. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Probably not. He's trying to take control of his life and protect his resources. Moving out to focus on his future isn't wrong, even if it means distancing from his family. It's a tough situation, but he's not obligated to support them financially beyond what he's already done. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
