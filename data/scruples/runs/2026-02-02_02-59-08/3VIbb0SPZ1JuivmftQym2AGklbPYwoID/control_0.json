I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to move out and not help his mom with her new baby. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the author's mom got pregnant, which caused a lot of financial strain. She initially considered an abortion but then changed her mind after taking the money from his account. The author is already struggling with school and work, making just enough to get by. His mom's boyfriend situation is messy too, adding more stress.\n\nThe author has been supporting the family financially, even contributing to the abortion, which his mom then used for baby items. That's a big betrayal. He's had issues with her taking small amounts before, but when he turned 18, he moved his money to a separate account, which is understandable. Now his mom is yelling at him for not being supportive enough, which is causing him to feel overwhelmed.\n\nHe's considering moving out to focus on his education and his own stability. The key points here are his financial responsibility, the lack of support from his mom (especially after she made choices against his advice), and his own well-being. He's not in a good place academically and financially, and taking on a sibling's child might push him over the edge. \n\nLegally, he's an adult now, and while family expectations can be strong, he's not obligated to support his sister's child unless there's a court order. His decision to move out is about his own survival and future. The mom's behavior seems to be self-centered, taking resources without consent and not considering his needs. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong here. He's trying to take control of his life when the family dynamics are not supporting his goals. His actions are a reaction to his mom's poor decisions and lack of responsibility. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
