I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong for moving out and refusing to help with their sister. \n\nFirst, let's break down the context. The author is an older sibling whose mom just had another child. The family's financial situation is already tight. The mom initially considered an abortion, which the author supported because of the financial strain, but then changed her mind and kept the baby. The mom used the author's money to buy baby items, which the author had given for the abortion. Now, the author is considering moving out to focus on their education and own life.\n\nSo, the main issues here are financial responsibility, family obligations, and personal boundaries. The author feels that their trust is broken because their mom took their money without permission before, and now they don't want to be financially responsible for the new sibling. The mom is pressuring the author to help, but the author feels it's unfair given the circumstances.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong. They might be thinking that as a sibling, you have a duty to help your family, especially parents. But I need to consider the other side. The author is trying to focus on their education and career, and they're in a tough spot financially. They've already taken steps to protect their finances by moving money to a separate account once they were 18. The mom's actions of using the money without permission and changing her mind about the abortion might have crossed a line, leading the author to feel they can't trust their mom.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that their dad left when they were 3, so maybe there's a history of instability. The author is working and trying to save for college, which is a significant life goal. Supporting another sibling might hinder that. The mom's claim that it's the author's responsibility as a big brother could be seen as placing undue pressure, especially when the author is already struggling. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that once you're part of a family, you have to make sacrifices. But the author is also setting boundaries here, which is important for their own well-being. The key points are autonomy, financial independence, and the ability to pursue one's own future without being burdened by others' choices. \n\nThe author isn't abandoning the sister entirely; they're just moving out to take care of themselves. It's about personal responsibility versus family obligations. The mom's actions, like using the money for baby items after the author contributed to the abortion, show a lack of consideration. The author's decision to move out could be seen as a necessary step to regain control over their life.\n\nSo, considering all this, I think the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're trying to protect their future and set boundaries after being taken advantage of financially. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
