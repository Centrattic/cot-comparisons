I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is a person in their late teens or early 20s, living with their mom and sister. Their mom had a baby with an unemployed boyfriend, but then decided to abort after some pressure. The author contributed money for the abortion, but the mom used that money to buy baby stuff instead. Then the mom changed her mind again and decided to keep the baby. Now the author is considering moving out to avoid being responsible for the new sibling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is not a legal guardian of the baby, so their responsibility isn't legally binding. However, the mom is the parent, so she's the one with the legal responsibility. The author is in a difficult financial situation, working and trying to go to school. The mom's actions seem erratic\u2014changing her mind about the abortion, taking money without permission, and now expecting the author to help raise the baby.\n\nThe author has a right to their own financial stability. If moving out allows them to focus on school and their future without the added burden of supporting another child, that's a valid decision. The mom's argument that it's the author's responsibility as a big brother might be emotionally charged, but legally, it's not their responsibility. The author has already been helping by contributing to the abortion, which the mom then misused. The mom's behavior shows a lack of responsibility, and the author is justified in wanting to protect their own resources.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author should support their family, especially their sister. But in this case, the mom is the parent, so the responsibility falls on her. The author is already financially strained, and adding another dependent could set them back. The author's decision to move out is a way to take control of their life and future, which is important for their own well-being.\n\nThe fact that the author tried to reason with their mom and the mom still acted irresponsibly suggests that the author is trying to do the right thing. The mom's response was defensive and unfair, calling the author selfish when the author is actually trying to protect their own resources. So, in this scenario, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to move out. The answer is B.\n"
