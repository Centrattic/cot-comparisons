I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong for considering moving out and refusing to support his sister.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person, let's call him Alex, has a difficult relationship with his mom. His dad left when he was 3. They're barely getting by financially. Alex is working, making more than his mom, and saving for college. His mom got pregnant, called her unemployed boyfriend, and then quit her job. The boyfriend pressured her to abort but she changed her mind, used Alex's money for the abortion, then spent all the money on baby stuff and decided to keep the baby. Now, Alex wants to move out because he doesn't trust his mom with his money and feels he can't handle being a parent again.\n\nSo the question is, is Alex in the wrong if he moves out? \n\nWell, from a legal standpoint, there's no legal obligation for a person to support someone else's child unless they have legal guardianship or a court order. But beyond that, there's the moral aspect. Alex has already been helping financially, but now his mom is using his money without permission. He's a minor, which complicates things because he can't control his finances independently until he's 18. Now that he's an adult, he's taking steps to secure his own finances.\n\nHe's also in school, working, and trying to save for college. The mom's actions have created a situation where she's not reliable, especially with her past behavior of taking money without consent. The sister's argument that it's Alex's responsibility as a big brother might be emotionally charged, but legally and ethically, that's not necessarily true. Alex isn't a parent, and while he might feel a bond, he's not obligated to support her child financially unless he's in a specific legal or custodial role.\n\nMoreover, the mom's decision to have the baby despite the financial instability and then using the money in a way that goes against Alex's wishes shows a lack of responsibility. Alex is making a choice to prioritize his own education and future, which is understandable. If he moves out, he's taking control of his life, which is a valid decision given the circumstances.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that as a sibling, Alex should help, but given the mom's history and the lack of support from her, it's a burden on Alex. Also, the sister's response was hostile, which doesn't help the situation. The boyfriend's absence further complicates things. \n\nSo, considering all factors, Alex isn't in the wrong. He's taking steps to protect his future and financial stability, which is reasonable. The answer should be B (No).\n"
