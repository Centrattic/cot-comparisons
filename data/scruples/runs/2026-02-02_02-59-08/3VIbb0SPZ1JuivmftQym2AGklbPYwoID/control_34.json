I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong if they decide to move out and leave their responsibilities towards their sister's new baby. \n\nFirst, the author is in a tough spot. Their mom is pregnant, but she initially decided to abort due to financial issues. However, after using the author's money for the abortion, she then changed her mind and bought baby items instead. The author has a strained relationship with their mom, their dad left when they were young, and they're struggling with school and work. They've already started moving out to focus on their education and reduce their financial burden.\n\nThe key points here are the author's motivations. They're not refusing to help because they don't care, but because they can't handle the added stress and don't trust their mom to manage the situation responsibly. The mom's actions\u2014like using the author's money for baby items despite the initial abortion\u2014show a pattern of making decisions that affect the author without considering their well-being or input. \n\nLegally, the author isn't a parent and isn't responsible for the baby. The mother has the right to make reproductive choices, but once she chose to keep the baby, the author isn't obligated to support it. Moving out is a personal decision for their own well-being, especially given their academic and career goals. The author's actions are about self-preservation and trying to take control of their future, which isn't selfish in this context. The mom's argument that the author has a responsibility as a sibling doesn't hold legal or moral weight here, as parental responsibilities fall on the parents, not siblings.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They're making a choice to prioritize their life and mental health given the circumstances.\n"
