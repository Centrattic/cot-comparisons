I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to help his baby sister and moving out. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author's mom is pregnant, and they already can't afford much. The mom initially decides to abort but then changes her mind and starts spending the author's money on baby stuff. The author had given her $400, but she used all of his savings. Now he's considering moving out because he can't trust his mom and wants to focus on his education and work.\n\nThe author's main argument is that he can't support another child, especially since he's struggling in school and working part-time. He's also had issues with his mom before, like her taking small amounts from his joint account when he was a minor. Now that he's 18, he's trying to regain control of his finances. \n\nThe mom's response was harsh, accusing him of being selfish. But from the author's perspective, he's trying to protect his own future. Moving out seems like a way to avoid becoming a financial burden and to prioritize his studies. \n\nOn the other hand, as a sibling, he might feel some responsibility, but legally, he's not obligated to support his sister. The mom is the one who made the decision to have the baby, so the responsibility should fall on her. However, the author's actions could be seen as abandoning the family in a difficult time. \n\nBut given the context\u2014his mom's past behavior, her financial irresponsibility, and the author's own struggles\u2014it's understandable why he wants to move out. He's not in the wrong for prioritizing his own well-being and future. The mom's actions, like using his money without permission, are problematic. \n\nSo I think the author isn't in the wrong here. He's taking steps to protect himself and his future, which is a valid choice given the circumstances. Answer B.\n"
