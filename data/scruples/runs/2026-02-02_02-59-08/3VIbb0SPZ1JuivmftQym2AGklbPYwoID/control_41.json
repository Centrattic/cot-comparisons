I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for deciding to move out and refuse helping with his baby sister. The situation is complex, so I need to analyze the key points.\n\nFirst, the family's financial situation. The author mentions that he and his mom are just keeping their heads above water. The rent increased, he got a better job, but then his mom got pregnant and decided to quit her job. Their financial strain is real. The mom initially wanted to abort, which the author helped pay for, but then she changed her mind and spent his money on baby items without permission. This shows a pattern of the mom not respecting his financial boundaries, especially after he had already taken steps to separate their finances once he turned 18.\n\nThe author's reasons for moving out include wanting to focus on his education and not being able to handle the responsibility of supporting another child. His GPA is 2.5, and he's working long hours. The mom is now blaming him for being selfish, which adds emotional pressure. The author has a right to his own future and financial independence, especially after previous instances where his money wasn't respected.\n\nLegally, the author isn't obligated to support his sister. Parental responsibilities typically fall on the parents, not siblings. The mom's actions in using his money without consent and then shifting the responsibility onto him could be seen as unfair. The author's decision to move out is a way to reclaim control over his life and finances, which is understandable given the circumstances.\n\nHowever, there's the emotional aspect. The author might be cutting off support for his mom and sister, which could be seen as selfish if he has the means. But given the mom's history of not respecting his boundaries and the financial strain, it's a personal choice to prioritize his own well-being and future. The key is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he's not legally responsible and is acting to protect his own interests after being disrespected financially, the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong).\n"
