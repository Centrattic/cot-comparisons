I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is an older brother whose mom got pregnant and then decided to keep the baby after initially deciding to have an abortion. The author is struggling financially with his mom and himself, and he's also dealing with his grades in school. The mom used his money for baby items even after he helped pay for the abortion, and now he's considering moving out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the responsibilities of siblings. The author isn't a legal parent, so maybe he isn't obligated to help raise the baby. But he did contribute financially to the abortion, and his mom is now holding him accountable for helping with the baby. The mom's argument is that it's his responsibility as a big brother, but legally and ethically, siblings don't have to take on parental duties unless they've agreed to it.\n\nThe author has his own financial struggles. He's working, trying to improve his grades, and saving for college. If he moves out, he can focus on his education without the added stress of supporting his family. The mom's actions, like using his money without permission, have broken his trust. He's taking steps to protect his financial independence, which seems reasonable.\n\nThe key points here are about consent and responsibility. The author didn't consent to help raise the baby, and his mom is now expecting him to take on that role, which he didn't agree to. His decision to move out is about reclaiming his autonomy and prioritizing his future. While it might be seen as selfish from the mom's perspective, the author isn't legally or morally bound to support the baby. Also, considering the mom's history of financial irresponsibility, the author's choice to move out is understandable.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. He's making a decision to protect his own well-being and future, which is valid. The answer should be B.\n"
