I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about his mom getting pregnant again when they're already struggling financially. He had to step in and help pay for an abortion because they couldn't afford a baby. Then his mom spends his money on baby items and suddenly wants to keep the baby. The author is considering moving out to avoid being responsible for the child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. The author is an adult now, over 18, so he has the right to make his own decisions about living arrangements. However, family dynamics can complicate things. His mom is using a moral argument that as an older brother, he should help raise the child. But legally, he's not a parent, so he doesn't have that obligation. \n\nThe mother's actions seem to be a big part of the problem. She made decisions without considering their financial stability, took his money without permission, and changed her mind after he helped with the abortion. This shows a lack of responsibility and trust. The author's decision to move out could be seen as a way to protect himself from being taken advantage of, especially since he's already under academic and financial stress.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author should support his family, especially his sister. But given the mother's behavior and the fact that the author has his own life to focus on (education, career), his choice to move out might be justified. It's important to respect his autonomy as an adult. \n\nAlso, the mother's boyfriend situation adds to the instability. The author isn't the parent, so he's not responsible for her choices. The fact that she's making decisions that affect their financial stability without consulting him or respecting his contributions (like the money he saved) is a significant issue.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's primary responsibility is to himself and his future. Moving out is a reasonable step to regain control over his life and financial security. The mother's demands are unrealistic given the circumstances. So I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
