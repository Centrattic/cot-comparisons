I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to help his baby sister and moving out. The situation is pretty complicated.\n\nFirst, the author has a strained relationship with his mom. His dad left when he was three, so he's been helping out financially. He's making more than her, but together they can just barely manage. He's also not doing great in school with a 2.5 GPA but is trying to improve and save for college. \n\nThen his mom gets pregnant, quits her job, and the boyfriend threatens to leave unless she aborts. The author and his boyfriend discuss the financial situation, and the author helps pay for the abortion, but his mom takes the money and uses it for baby items, then changes her mind. Now, when the author turns 18, he takes his money out of the joint account. His mom yells at him about being selfish and that it's his responsibility as a brother. The author wants to move out to focus on school and work less, but his mom is being hostile.\n\nSo, is the author wrong to move out? Well, he's an adult now, 18, so legally he can make his own decisions. His mom is being irresponsible by taking the money intended for the abortion, which he had given for that purpose. He's already contributing a lot, and with the rent increase, he's had to work more. Moving out to prioritize his education and financial independence might be a valid choice. But on the other hand, she is his mother, and there's a parent-child relationship. However, the mother has a history of taking his money without permission, and he's not in a position to support another child. The mother's argument about responsibility seems manipulative, especially since she changed her mind after taking the money. The author might feel that his well-being and future are important, and he's not obligated to support her new child, especially given her track record. \n\nI think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. He's protecting his own interests and future, and his mother's actions have been irresponsible and untrustworthy. Moving out is a personal choice, and he's not obligated to support her decisions, especially when they've been made without considering his input or financial contributions.\n"
