I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author in the given situation is in the wrong if they decide to move out and leave their baby sister. The author's mom got pregnant, initially decided to abort but then changed her mind after using the author's money for baby items. The author is frustrated, feels the mom is irresponsible, and wants to move out to focus on their studies and work.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. The author is an adult now (since they turned 18 and took control of their bank account), so they have the legal right to manage their finances. The mom's actions\u2014using the author's money without permission and changing her mind about the abortion\u2014might be seen as irresponsible. The author is not legally obligated to support their sister, especially if they weren't the ones who conceived the child.\n\nEthically, the situation is more complex. The author is concerned about their own future, education, and financial stability. Moving out could be seen as a way to avoid being burdened by their mother's decisions. However, the sister is their responsibility by blood, and moving out might leave the mother unable to care for the child, leading to potential neglect. But the author's reasoning is that they can't trust their mother to handle this responsibly, given her past actions.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the mother's previous behavior, like draining the author's account for baby items despite the author's financial struggles. This shows a pattern of taking without permission, which the author has tried to address by controlling their own finances now. The author is trying to set boundaries to protect their future.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister is a minor and dependent on the family. If the author moves out, the mother might not be able to support the child adequately, leading to possible legal issues for her. However, the author isn't in a position to be the parent, and the situation seems to be the mother's responsibility, not the author's. The author is not a legal guardian or parent, so they aren't legally required to take on that role.\n\nConsidering all these points, the author is trying to protect their own well-being and future. They've been exploited before and are avoiding further financial and emotional strain. While the sister's needs are important, the author's autonomy and rights as an adult should be respected. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for choosing to move out to support their own goals and avoid being taken advantage of again.\n"
