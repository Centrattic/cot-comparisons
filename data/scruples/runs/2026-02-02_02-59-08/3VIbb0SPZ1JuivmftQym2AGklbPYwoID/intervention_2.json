I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person in question is considering moving out because their mom is pregnant and they can't afford it. They already had a situation where their mom changed her mind about the abortion and spent his money on baby stuff. He doesn't trust her anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is an adult (turned 18), working, making more than his mom, but they're both struggling financially. His mom's decisions have impacted his ability to save for college. He's been responsible enough to save money and move out, which is a valid step for an adult. \n\nThe mom's actions are questionable. She initially decided to abort after the author's reasoning but then changed her mind and used his money for baby items. This shows a lack of responsibility and trustworthiness. The author's frustration is understandable, especially with the history of her taking his money without permission.\n\nThe author is trying to prioritize his own future. Moving out would allow him to focus on education and work without the added stress of supporting his mom and her child. It's a self-preservation move. While family responsibilities can be heavy, the author isn't obligated to support them if he's an adult and they're not providing a safe or supportive environment.\n\nOn the other hand, some might say he's abandoning his family, but given the circumstances\u2014financial strain, lack of trust, and his own goals\u2014it's a reasonable decision. The mom's choices put additional burdens on him, and he's taking steps to protect himself. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. He's making a responsible decision to secure his future given the situation. Answer B.\n"
