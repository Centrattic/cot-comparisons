I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to move out and refuse supporting his baby sister.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author's mom is pregnant again. They're already struggling financially, and her boyfriend left after she insisted on keeping the baby. The author helped pay for an abortion, but his mom used his money for baby stuff then changed her mind. Now she's accusing him of being selfish and demanding he help raise the child. The author wants to move out to focus on school and his future.\n\nSo, from the author's perspective, he's dealing with a lot of stress. His family isn't stable\u2014his dad left, his mom isn't working now, and they can't afford another child. The author is trying to save money for college and has a job. He's worried about being financially responsible for the baby on top of his own expenses. Plus, his mom took his money before without permission, which makes him distrustful. Moving out seems like a way to gain independence and not be burdened by her poor financial decisions.\n\nOn the other hand, his mom argues that as a brother, it's his responsibility to help. But siblings don't have a legal obligation to support each other's children unless they've taken on that role voluntarily. The author is already contributing by helping with the abortion cost, but then his mom changed her mind again. That shows inconsistency and lack of responsibility on her part. The author isn't the parent, so his responsibility isn't as clear. He's also a minor in the bank account issue before, which complicates things because he had limited control over his own money.\n\nLegally, children aren't responsible for supporting their siblings' children unless there's a court order or specific circumstances. The author is trying to take control of his life, which is understandable. He's in a tough spot with his grades and work, and moving out might help him focus on his future. The mom's actions, like using his money for baby items and then expecting him to help, seem unreasonable. He's trying to protect his own financial stability and future, which is a valid reason.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. He's trying to manage his own life and escape a financially unstable situation where he's been taken advantage of. His decision to move out is about self-preservation and improving his own prospects, not neglecting family. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
