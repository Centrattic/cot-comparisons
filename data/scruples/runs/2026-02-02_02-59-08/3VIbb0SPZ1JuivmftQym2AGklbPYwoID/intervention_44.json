I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for considering moving out and leaving their baby sister, given the situation described.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points of the scenario. The author is dealing with a mother who became pregnant, initially decided to abort after being convinced by the author, but then changed her mind and kept the baby. The mother used the author's money for the abortion and then for baby items. The author feels that they can't trust their mother with their finances anymore and is considering moving out to focus on their education and work. The mother is now blaming the author for being selfish and expects them to help raise the baby.\n\nNow, the ethical dilemma here is about responsibility and personal accountability. The author is an adult now, 18 years old, and has the means to move out. They feel that their mother is not being responsible by having a child without the means to support it and by misusing their money. The mother's actions seem to be the root of the problem here\u2014she made a decision that affected her son's financial stability and future.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author isn't obligated to support someone else's child, especially when the parent isn't capable of providing for them. The author is trying to take control of their life and future, which is understandable. The mother's behavior, including using the author's money without consent and then shifting responsibility, seems to be the main issue here.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of family responsibility. The author might feel a duty to help, but if the mother is not being responsible herself, the author's responsibility is questionable. The author is also in a vulnerable position academically and financially, and moving out could help them improve their situation.\n\nThe key points to consider are: the mother's irresponsibility, the author's right to autonomy, and the financial exploitation. The author is not in the wrong for wanting to protect their future and resources. They have the right to make decisions that affect their own life, especially when their well-being is at stake.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
