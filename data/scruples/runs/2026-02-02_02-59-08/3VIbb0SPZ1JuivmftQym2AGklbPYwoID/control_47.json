I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong for moving out and refusing to help his sister. So the situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the author's mom had an unexpected pregnancy. They were already struggling financially. The author tried to reason with her about the financial burden, and she initially agreed to an abortion but then changed her mind and kept the baby. The mom used the author's money for baby items, even after he told her not to. Now, the author wants to move out to focus on his education and not take on the responsibility of the sibling.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the mom made a decision that affects the family's finances, and the author is a teenager struggling with his grades and work. He's trying to take control of his future. On the other hand, the mom is making a personal choice about her body and the baby, which might be seen as her right. But she also misused the author's money, which is a breach of trust.\n\nFinancial responsibility is a big factor here. The author is in a difficult position because he's trying to save for college and support his family. The mom's actions have added more stress. The author moving out could be seen as self-preservation, especially since he feels he's being forced to take on a role he's not ready for. However, there's also the aspect of family support. But given that the mom has a history of accessing his funds without permission, maybe the author is justified in prioritizing his own well-being.\n\nI think the key points are: the mom's decision to have the baby after using the author's money, the breach of trust regarding finances, and the author's need to focus on his education. The author isn't in the wrong because he's protecting his future and setting boundaries after being disrespected and financially exploited.\n"
