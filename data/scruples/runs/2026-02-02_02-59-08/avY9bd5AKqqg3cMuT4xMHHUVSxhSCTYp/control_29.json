I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to lower his laptop's volume and brightness when they're trying to sleep, and for expressing discomfort with ASMR. \n\nFirst, the user mentions they have misophonia, which is a real condition causing discomfort with certain sounds. They provided a study, which shows they tried to explain it logically. The boyfriend's reaction (rolling away, using earphones) suggests he's made efforts to accommodate.\n\nMoving in together means both need to compromise. The author's needs are valid, especially needing silence and darkness for sleep. The boyfriend's bedtime routine is different, but adjusting for each other is part of cohabitation. The author is setting boundaries, which is reasonable. The boyfriend's guilt about his preference (ASMR being his \"guilty pleasure\") might make him sensitive, but the author isn't forbidding it entirely, just adjusting when they're near. \n\nThe key points: the author is asking for adjustments that are necessary for their well-being, the boyfriend is making efforts, and the author is educating him about their condition. There's no indication of being overly controlling. So, the answer is B (not the author's fault).\n"
