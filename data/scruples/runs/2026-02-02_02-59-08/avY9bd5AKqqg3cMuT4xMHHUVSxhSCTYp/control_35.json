I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple moving in together with different bedtime routines. The author needs silence and darkness, while the boyfriend uses his laptop with ASMR, which the author finds really irritating due to misophonia. The author has asked him to adjust the volume, brightness, etc., and showed him a study about misophonia and ASMR. The boyfriend reacts by moving away and using earphones.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author is being unreasonable. The key points are communication, mutual respect, and understanding. The author is expressing their needs and providing information about their condition. They're not necessarily being controlling but trying to accommodate their own health needs. The boyfriend's reaction is to distance himself, which might be a way to comply without conflict.\n\nIs the author overstepping? Well, they're in a shared living situation. They've communicated their boundaries, which is reasonable. They also provided a study, which shows they're trying to explain the issue. The boyfriend isn't being forced to stop entirely but is asked to adjust when the author is trying to sleep. \n\nThe boyfriend's guiltiest pleasure is ASMR, but the author's discomfort is valid due to misophonia. It's about balancing both partners' needs. Since the author is asking for adjustments that are feasible (like earphones, lower brightness), it's reasonable. The boyfriend's solution (using earphones) is a compromise. The author isn't forbidding him from his hobby but asking to avoid it during their sleep time. \n\nSo, the answer is probably B (not in the wrong). The author is communicating a legitimate need and making reasonable requests. The boyfriend's reaction might be a bit defensive, but the author isn't at fault here.\n"
