I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a boyfriend's bedtime routine involving his laptop, which the author finds disruptive when trying to sleep. The key points are the boyfriend's use of loud sounds, bright screens, and ASMR, especially whispering, which the author is sensitive to (misophonia). The author asks him to adjust these things, which leads to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author's actions are reasonable. The author has a legitimate need for a quiet and dark environment to sleep. Moving in together likely means they have to compromise on such things. The boyfriend's use of a laptop with volume and brightness could indeed disturb the author. The fact that the author has tried to communicate this and even provided a study about their sensitivity shows they're making an effort to explain their needs. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might feel his own needs are being ignored, especially if he uses the laptop as a wind-down activity. However, since they're sharing a space, mutual adjustments are necessary. The author isn't demanding the boyfriend to stop entirely but asking for modifications like lowering volume or brightness. The boyfriend's reaction (rolling away and using earphones) seems like a way to avoid conflict but doesn't address the initial request. \n\nMisophonia is a real condition, and the author's discomfort is valid. The question is whether the author is being unreasonable by persistently asking for these adjustments. Since the author is trying to communicate their needs and provide context, it's more about mutual respect and finding a compromise rather than the author being in the wrong. The boyfriend's guiltiest pleasure here is the ASMR, but the author's health and well-being (due to misophonia) should be considered. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No) because the author is not in the wrong. They're advocating for their needs in a shared living space, especially with a legitimate sensitivity. However, the boyfriend also needs to find a way to accommodate without resentment. The author's actions are reasonable, and the boyfriend's reaction may indicate a need for further discussion to find a middle ground.\n"
