I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop use and ASMR consumption at night. The author mentions they need silence and darkness for sleep, while the boyfriend has a different routine. The key points are the boyfriend's ASMR with whispering causing the author misophonia symptoms.\n\nFirst, the author has a legitimate health issue (misophonia) that's affecting their comfort. They've tried to communicate and even provided research, which shows they're trying to explain their needs. The boyfriend's reaction (rolling away and using earphones) suggests he's trying to accommodate, which is a good sign.\n\nBut the author is asking a lot: turning down sound, lowering brightness, adjusting position. Maybe some of these requests are excessive or frequent. However, since the author needs a quiet, dark environment for sleep, which is important for their well-being, these requests are valid. The boyfriend might find the constant asking annoying, but the author's health and comfort are priorities. The boyfriend could have a counter-argument about needing his routine, but the author's needs are more urgent for rest. It's a balancing act, but the author's actions seem reasonable given their condition. So I don't think the author is in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
