I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop's volume and brightness so they can sleep, especially when he's watching ASMR content, which the author has misophonia towards whispering.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author and their boyfriend have different bedtime needs. The author needs silence and darkness, while the boyfriend uses his laptop for YouTube or ASMR, which he enjoys. The author is asking him to turn down the sound and brightness, which he doesn't like. The boyfriend's behavior is causing the author anxiety and discomfort, especially with whispering ASMR. The author shared a study about misophonia, which led the boyfriend to use earphones.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's think about communication and mutual respect in a relationship. The author is expressing their needs and explaining their condition, which is valid. Misophonia is a real condition that can cause significant distress, so the author isn't being unreasonable. The boyfriend's reaction (rolling over, using earphones) suggests he respects their request. However, the author is repeatedly asking for adjustments, which might be seen as nagging if not handled sensitively. But given the health impact (anxiety, etc.), it's more about accommodating each other's needs.\n\nThe boyfriend's guiltiest pleasure is ASMR, so he might have strong feelings about it. But in a shared living space, both need to compromise. The author isn't forbidding him from doing it altogether; just adjusting it to not disturb them. The boyfriend's actions after being informed about the study show he's willing to compromise. The author isn't being unreasonable here. They're communicating their needs and the health impact, which is a valid concern.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is not in the wrong. They're advocating for their well-being, and the boyfriend is making changes. The answer should be B.\n"
