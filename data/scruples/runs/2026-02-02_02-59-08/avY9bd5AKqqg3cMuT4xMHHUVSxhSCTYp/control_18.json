I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about their boyfriend's bedtime habits causing them distress. The author mentions that they need silence and darkness, while the boyfriend uses his laptop with sound and brightness, especially ASMR with whispering which triggers their misophonia.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author's actions are reasonable. Misophonia is a real condition that causes strong negative reactions to specific sounds. The author has communicated their discomfort and even provided a study to their boyfriend. The boyfriend's response is to use earphones, which is a respectful compromise. The author is asking for adjustments, which is about their own comfort in their home, especially since they've moved in together. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might feel that his own habits are being restricted, but the author is not banning his activities entirely, just adjusting the volume and brightness. Since they live together, both partners have a right to a comfortable sleeping environment. The key points are communication, mutual respect, and finding a compromise. The author seems to be advocating for their needs without being overly controlling, given the health aspect of misophonia. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They have a valid reason related to their well-being and have taken steps to communicate and compromise. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
