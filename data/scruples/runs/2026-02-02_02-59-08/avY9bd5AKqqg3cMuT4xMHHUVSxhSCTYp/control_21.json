I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in their situation with their boyfriend. The main issue is about the boyfriend using his laptop with sound and brightness on at night, which disrupts the author's sleep. The author has misophonia when it comes to whispering ASMR, which makes them uncomfortable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author has a legitimate health issue\u2014misophonia can be a real thing, and it's affecting their well-being. They're communicating their needs, which is important in a relationship. On the other hand, the boyfriend has his own bedtime routine that he's used to, maybe even relies on for relaxation. Moving in together can present these kinds of challenges where both people have to adjust.\n\nThe author is asking the boyfriend to make adjustments, like lowering the volume and brightness, using headphones, etc. They even showed him a study about misophonia and ASMR, which he responded to by putting in earphones. That suggests he tried to accommodate her after understanding her issue better.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Well, if someone has a medical condition and communicates their needs, it's not their fault. The boyfriend might need to adjust, but the author isn't being unreasonable here. The key points are communication and mutual adjustment. The author is trying to find a solution, not just being difficult. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
