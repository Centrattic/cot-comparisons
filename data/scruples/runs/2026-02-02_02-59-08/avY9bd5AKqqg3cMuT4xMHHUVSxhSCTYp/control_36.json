I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is an asshole for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop use and avoid ASMR when they're trying to sleep. The author mentions they have misophonia when it comes to whispering, which causes them anxiety and discomfort. They've shown a study to their boyfriend, and he responds by putting in earphones.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's needs for silence and darkness are valid, especially since they have a specific sensitivity. Misophonia is a real condition, so their reaction isn't just being overly sensitive. The boyfriend's routine includes activities that are causing distress to the author, so it's reasonable for them to communicate their needs.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might feel his habits are being restricted, and maybe there's a lack of compromise. However, the author is asking for adjustments that are reasonable, like lowering volume or brightness. The fact that the boyfriend uses earphones after being shown the study suggests he respects the author's feelings and is making an effort. The author isn't demanding the boyfriend stop his routine entirely but wants modifications to coexist peacefully.\n\nSo, the author is advocating for their well-being, which is justified. The boyfriend's response seems positive, indicating the author isn't being unreasonable. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
