I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The scenario is about their boyfriend's bedtime routine involving a laptop with sound and brightness that's bothering the author. The author has misophonia specifically towards whispering ASMR, which makes them anxious and uncomfortable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is moving in together, which is a significant step, and they have different bedtime needs. The author communicates their discomfort, which seems reasonable. Misophonia is a real issue, so their reaction isn't just being picky. They provided a study to explain their feelings, which shows they're trying to be understanding and informative.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend has his own routine and preferences. The author is asking him to adjust every night, which might be frustrating for him. The key here is whether the author is being unreasonable. Since they've communicated their needs and provided a reason (misophonia), it's about finding a compromise. The boyfriend's response of putting in earphones when told suggests he's willing to accommodate. However, the author's constant requests might be seen as nagging if they aren't finding a middle ground. But given the health aspect of misophonia, it's not just about preferences. \n\nAlso, moving in together means both need to compromise. If the boyfriend's routine is causing the author significant distress, it's reasonable to address it. The author isn't just being a burden; they have a legitimate medical reason. The boyfriend could also consider using headphones to avoid disturbing the author, which seems like a simple solution. The author's actions are about their well-being, which is important. So, I don't think the author is in the wrong. They're advocating for their health and trying to find a solution, which is reasonable in a shared living situation.\n"
