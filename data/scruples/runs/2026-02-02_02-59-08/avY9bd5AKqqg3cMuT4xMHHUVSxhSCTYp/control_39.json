I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they moved in together with their boyfriend. The author needs silence and darkness for sleep, but the boyfriend uses his laptop in bed, which he does for things like watching YouTube, ASMR, etc. The author keeps asking him to lower the volume and brightness, and specifically mentions being uncomfortable with whispering ASMR. They even showed a study about misophonia and ASMR to the boyfriend, who then used earphones.\n\nFirst, the user is asking if the author is at fault. Let's break down the key points. The author has a legitimate need for a quiet and dark environment to sleep. They've communicated their needs, which is important. The boyfriend's habits are causing discomfort. The author isn't just complaining; they've tried to explain their feelings with a research study, which shows they're making an effort to understand and communicate the issue. The boyfriend's reaction of putting in earphones seems like a positive step, but maybe there's more needed.\n\nNow, considering the question of wrongdoing. If the author is setting boundaries for their own well-being and communicating them, that's reasonable. The boyfriend's habits, while his personal preference, are affecting the author's health and comfort. The fact that the author tried to find a solution (using the study) and the boyfriend took steps to comply suggests that the author isn't being unreasonable. However, maybe the author could be more considerate of the boyfriend's needs? But the problem here is that the author's needs are being met through adjustments. It's a balance, but since the author isn't ignoring the boyfriend's feelings and is making compromises (like allowing him to watch but asking for adjustments), it seems fair. The boyfriend's use of earphones after the discussion also shows he's trying to accommodate. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for setting these boundaries.\n"
