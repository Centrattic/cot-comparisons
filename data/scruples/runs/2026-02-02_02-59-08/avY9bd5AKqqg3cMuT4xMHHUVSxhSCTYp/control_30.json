I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is the asshole (AITA) for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop settings and ASMR habits when they move in together.\n\nFirst, the key points from the scenario: The author and their boyfriend have different bedtime routines. The author needs silence and darkness to sleep, while the boyfriend uses his laptop for YouTube or ASMR, which he enjoys. The author asks him to turn down the sound, lower brightness, etc., which the boyfriend doesn't like. The author also has a specific issue with whispering ASMR, which causes them anxiety and discomfort. They showed him a study about misophonia, and he responded by putting in earphones.\n\nMisophonia is a real condition where certain sounds trigger strong negative reactions. The author is dealing with this, specifically with whispering. They've communicated their needs and provided evidence (the study) to explain their reaction. The boyfriend's response was to use earphones, avoiding direct confrontation but also not engaging further. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on several factors: communication, mutual respect, and the presence of a health issue. The author has clearly communicated their needs and given a reason (misophonia). The boyfriend, while possibly frustrated, could be accommodating by using earphones. The author isn't being unreasonable here; they're asserting their health needs. The boyfriend's reaction is to distance himself, which might indicate he's not fully supportive, but the author isn't the one at fault for standing up for their well-being. The key here is that the author isn't imposing on others without reason; they have a legitimate issue. So, the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
