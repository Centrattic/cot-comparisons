  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for always asking my boyfriend to turn his laptop sound and brightness down when I'm trying to sleep and for telling him how anxious, trapped and irritated ASMR makes me when that is his guiltiest pleasure?\nSo we just moved in together, and I knew already his bedtime routine is to watch YouTube, or listen to ASMR, or just be on his laptop in general. I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his bedtime habits. The key points here are the author's need for silence and darkness versus the boyfriend's preference for using his laptop, especially ASMR with whispering.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they have misophonia when it comes to whispering ASMR, which causes them anxiety and discomfort. They provided a study to the boyfriend, who then used earphones. That shows the boyfriend made an effort to accommodate their needs. However, the author is still asking him to turn down the volume and brightness every night. \n\nNow, moving in together often requires compromise. The author's needs are valid, especially since they mentioned needing a dark and quiet environment to sleep. The boyfriend's bedtime routine involves using his laptop, which is his way of relaxing. The author is setting boundaries, which is reasonable. But is it going too far? \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is to roll over and put in earphones when the author tells him about the ASMR issue. That indicates he's making an effort. However, the author still has to ask him repeatedly about the brightness and volume. Maybe there's a middle ground here. For example, using a sleep mask to block light or white noise machine to drown out sounds. But the author hasn't mentioned trying these solutions. \n\nThe question is whether the author is overstepping by constantly asking for adjustments. Since they have a legitimate health issue (misophonia), it's not unreasonable for them to request accommodations. However, if the boyfriend is making efforts and the author is still persistently nagging, that could be seen as the author not considering the boyfriend's needs. The key here is mutual compromise. \n\nThe author's actions might be justified if they've discussed the issue and the boyfriend isn't making sufficient changes. But if the boyfriend is already using earphones and the author is still making repeated requests, maybe the author is being too demanding. It's a balance between health needs and respecting the partner's habits. \n\nIn conclusion, since the author has a valid medical condition and the boyfriend is making efforts, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend might need to make further adjustments, but the author's requests are understandable.\n"
