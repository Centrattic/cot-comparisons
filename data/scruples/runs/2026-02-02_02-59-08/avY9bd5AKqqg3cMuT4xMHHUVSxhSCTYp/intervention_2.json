I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop usage and ASMR when they're trying to sleep. The author mentions they have misophonia related to whispering, which causes anxiety and discomfort. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is clearly communicating their needs, which is important in a relationship. They provided a study to explain their condition, which shows they're trying to be understanding. The boyfriend's reaction of rolling away and using earphones suggests he respects their boundaries.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's bedtime routine is important to him. But since they live together, mutual adjustments are necessary. The author isn't banning all his activities but asking for specific changes that accommodate both. The fact that the author tried to explain their medical condition adds weight to their request.\n\nI think the key points are communication and health. The author isn't being unreasonable; they have a valid health issue. The boyfriend's willingness to comply (using earphones) shows he's making an effort too. So the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
