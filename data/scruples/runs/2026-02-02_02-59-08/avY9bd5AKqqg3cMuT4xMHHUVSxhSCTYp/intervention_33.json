  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for always asking my boyfriend to turn his laptop sound and brightness down when I'm trying to sleep and for telling him how anxious, trapped and irritated ASMR makes me when that is his guiltiest pleasure?\nSo we just moved in together, and I knew already his bedtime routine is to watch YouTube, or listen to ASMR, or just be on his laptop in general. I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple moving in together, where one partner (the author) asks their boyfriend to adjust his laptop's volume and brightness because the sounds and light from ASMR videos are causing them discomfort. The author mentions having misophonia, a condition where certain sounds trigger negative reactions, and they showed a study to their boyfriend. The boyfriend responds by rolling away and using earphones.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate this. First, the author is trying to communicate their needs clearly. They mention their bedtime routine requires silence and darkness, which is valid. People have different needs, especially in shared living spaces. The boyfriend's bedtime activities might be his way of relaxing, but the author is experiencing physical discomfort from the sounds. Misophonia is a real condition, so the author's reaction isn't just being fussy. \n\nThe boyfriend's response (rolling away and using earphones) suggests he's making an effort to accommodate the author's needs without being confrontational. The author is asking for adjustments that are reasonable in a shared living situation. They're not demanding complete silence but asking for volume and brightness adjustments, which is a common courtesy. \n\nHowever, the boyfriend might feel his needs aren't being respected if he has to make these changes every night. But since the author is experiencing actual distress, it's more about balancing both partners' needs. The key here is that the author is trying to find a middle ground, and the boyfriend is making adjustments. Neither is entirely in the wrong, but the author is advocating for their health and well-being, which is justified. \n\nSo, considering the context and the fact that the author has a medical condition affecting them, their requests are reasonable. The boyfriend's efforts to comply indicate he's trying to be accommodating. The author isn't being unreasonable by setting boundaries for their own comfort. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
