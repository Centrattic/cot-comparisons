I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple moving in together and having differing bedtime routines. The author wants their boyfriend to lower the laptop's brightness and sound because they can't sleep with that, especially when he's listening to ASMR with whispering, which the author says causes misophonia-like symptoms.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a legitimate need for silence and darkness to sleep, which is a basic requirement for rest. The boyfriend has his own bedtime routine that involves using the laptop, which is a common thing people do. The author is asking for adjustments to accommodate their needs, which could be seen as reasonable, especially in a shared living space. However, the boyfriend might feel his needs are being disregarded.\n\nThe key points here are communication and compromise. The author has tried to explain their discomfort, even showing a study to the boyfriend. The boyfriend responded by using earphones, which is a good step. But maybe the author isn't considering the boyfriend's needs enough. For example, maybe the boyfriend uses the laptop to relax before bed, and the author's constant requests are causing him stress. \n\nHowever, the author's health and well-being are important. If the boyfriend's activities are affecting the author's ability to sleep and causing anxiety, it's reasonable to ask for adjustments. It's about finding a middle ground. Maybe they could agree on specific times or areas where he can use the laptop without disturbing her, or they could invest in a better soundproof solution. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author is advocating for their own needs and communicating them, that's not inherently wrong. The boyfriend's reaction (rolling over, using earphones) shows he's trying to comply. However, if the author is being overly demanding or not giving the boyfriend enough space to have his own routine, that could be a problem. \n\nBut given the information, the author has a valid reason based on their health (misophonia-like symptoms) and is trying to find a solution. The boyfriend is making adjustments. Maybe the author isn't considering the boyfriend's need for his own routine, but that's not clear. The author's actions seem justified, so the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
