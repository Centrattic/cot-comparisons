I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop usage and ASMR listening habits to accommodate their need for silence and darkness to sleep. \n\nFirst, the author moves in with their boyfriend, and they have a bedtime routine that requires silence and darkness. The boyfriend, on the other hand, uses his laptop for YouTube or ASMR, which the author finds disturbing. The author has communicated their discomfort multiple times, and the boyfriend reacts by rolling over or using earphones. The key point here is that the author is trying to get their needs met, which are reasonable\u2014everyone deserves a good night's sleep.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems to be avoiding the situation rather than addressing the root issue. When the author explains that whispering ASMR causes them anxiety and shows a study, the boyfriend just moves away and uses earphones. That doesn't exactly sound like a cooperative response. It seems like the boyfriend isn't making a real effort to find a solution that works for both parties. \n\nThe author isn't just being picky; they have a legitimate medical condition (misophonia) that's causing discomfort. It's reasonable to expect that a partner would make adjustments to accommodate that, especially since they live together. The boyfriend's \"guilty pleasure\" should not override the author's health and well-being. \n\nHowever, the author should also be open to finding a compromise. Maybe the boyfriend can use a different room for his ASMR, or they can agree on specific times when he can listen without disturbing the author. But the author isn't wrong for expressing their needs and asking for changes. The boyfriend's lack of effort to resolve the issue is more problematic. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They're advocating for their health and well-being in a shared living space. The boyfriend isn't making an effort to adjust, which is where the issue lies. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
