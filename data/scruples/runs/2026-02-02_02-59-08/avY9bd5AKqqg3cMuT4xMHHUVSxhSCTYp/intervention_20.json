I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a boyfriend and girlfriend moving in together. The author (the girlfriend) asks her boyfriend to lower the laptop's sound and brightness when she's trying to sleep because she needs silence and darkness. She also tells him that whispering ASMR makes her anxious. He does adjust, but she feels like she's being overbearing.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider mutual respect and communication. The author has made her needs known, which is reasonable. Misophonia is a real condition, so her discomfort with certain sounds like whispering ASMR could be valid. She shared a study, which shows she's trying to educate him, not just be controlling.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might have his own preferences. But when two people live together, some compromises are expected. The author is asking for adjustments that are minimal\u2014lowering the volume and brightness, using earphones. These aren't unreasonable, especially since he's already doing them after she explains. \n\nThe key here is whether the requests are excessive or if the boyfriend is being considerate. The author says he \"immediately rolled away and put earphones in,\" which suggests he's responsive. The boyfriend might be in the wrong if he's not respecting her need for a good night's sleep. However, the author's perspective is that she's always making these requests, which could be irritating. But given her health and comfort, it's a valid concern. \n\nSo, the answer probably isn't A. The author is advocating for her well-being, which is important. The boyfriend could adjust his habits a bit for her, especially since the solutions are simple. Unless there's a history of the author being overly controlling, which isn't mentioned here, she's not the asshole. Therefore, answer B.\n"
