I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they moved in with their boyfriend, and his bedtime routine involves using his laptop, either watching YouTube or listening to ASMR. The author needs silence and darkness for sleep, so they ask him to lower the volume and brightness. The boyfriend doesn't seem happy about it.\n\nThe key points here are about mutual consideration in a shared living space. The author is making a reasonable request to adjust the environment for their own comfort, especially since they have a specific sensitivity to whispering ASMR, which causes them anxiety. They mentioned showing a study to the boyfriend, which he then acted on by using earphones. That seems like he acknowledged the issue.\n\nBut the boyfriend's reaction, rolling away and putting in earphones, might indicate he's putting up a wall instead of engaging in a discussion. However, the author is asking for adjustments that don't seem unreasonable. The boyfriend's habits are affecting the author's well-being, so it's reasonable for them to communicate their needs.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for setting these boundaries. Since they're living together, both need to accommodate each other. The author isn't asking him to stop entirely but to use earphones or adjust the volume and brightness. The boyfriend's guiltiest pleasure is ASMR, but if it's causing distress to his partner, he should find a way to enjoy it without affecting her. The fact that he used earphones after being shown the study suggests he did make an effort, but maybe there's more room for compromise. However, the author's actions are about their health and comfort, so they aren't in the wrong for asking for these adjustments. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
