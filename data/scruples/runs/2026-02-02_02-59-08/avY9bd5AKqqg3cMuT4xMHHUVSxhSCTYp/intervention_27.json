I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The key points are the author's requests to their boyfriend to lower the laptop's sound and brightness for better sleep, and the discomfort caused by ASMR, especially whispering.\n\nFirst, moving in together often involves adjusting habits. The author is trying to communicate their needs, which is reasonable. They mention having misophonia related to whispering, which is a real condition. They even provided a study, showing they're informed about their sensitivity. The boyfriend's reaction (rolling away and using earphones) suggests he's trying to accommodate.\n\nThe author's requests are about their own comfort in their shared space. It's important to consider mutual respect here. While the boyfriend's habits are his preference, the author's health and sleep quality are also valid. The question is whether the author is overstepping by making these requests. Since they're in a relationship and living together, open communication is key. The author isn't demanding a complete halt but adjustments that don't infringe on the boyfriend's use of his space. \n\nOn the other hand, if the boyfriend is also trying to wind down and the author's requests are frequent and maybe not always respectful, that could be an issue. But the scenario doesn't indicate that the author is being rude, just persistent. The boyfriend's immediate compliance (using earphones) shows he's making an effort. The author's actions seem justified given their health concerns and the move-in context. So, the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
