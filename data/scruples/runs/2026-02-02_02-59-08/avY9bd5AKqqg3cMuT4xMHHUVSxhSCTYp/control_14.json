I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop usage and ASMR listening habits during bedtime.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. They moved in together. The boyfriend has a bedtime routine involving YouTube, ASMR, or using his laptop. The author needs silence and darkness for sleep. They ask him to turn down the sound, lower brightness, etc., which he doesn't like. The main issue is the ASMR with whispering, which causes the author anxiety and discomfort. They showed him a study about misophonia and ASMR, and he put in earphones.\n\nSo, the author is standing up for their needs, which is important. They have a legitimate health concern with misophonia. However, the boyfriend might feel his needs aren't being respected. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for asserting their needs even if it makes the boyfriend uncomfortable.\n\nIn relationships, both partners need to compromise. The author is communicating their needs, which is healthy. But they also need to consider the boyfriend's habits. The fact that he put in earphones after being shown the study suggests he's willing to adjust. The author isn't forbidding him entirely from doing his routine; they're just asking for adjustments that respect their sleep. Since they moved in together, setting boundaries is part of cohabitation. The author's actions seem reasonable, so the answer is B.\n"
