I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's boyfriend using his laptop with sound and brightness on, which disrupts her sleep. She has to ask him to adjust it every night. He listens when she tells him to turn it down, but when he listens to whispering ASMR, she's particularly bothered because of misophonia. She showed him a study, and he put on earphones.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if her actions are unreasonable. She's asking him to adjust his habits to accommodate her needs. Moving in together usually requires compromise. She's communicated her needs and he complies, which is good. The issue is whether her demands are excessive. \n\nShe mentions she has misophonia related to whispering, which is a recognized condition. That adds a medical aspect, making her sensitivity valid. The boyfriend's response of using earphones after seeing the study shows he's trying to accommodate her. \n\nBut the author is asking if she's the asshole for always making these requests. She's not violent or rude, just persistent. Since she's communicating her needs and he's making adjustments, it's a mutual effort. Her condition might make her needs more specific, so she's not wrong. \n\nAlternatively, some might think she should be more flexible, but considering her health issue and their living situation, it's reasonable. The key points are communication, mutual adjustment, and her valid medical condition. Therefore, the answer is B (she's not in the wrong).\n"
