I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop use and ASMR consumption when they're trying to sleep. \n\nFirst, the boyfriend and the author just moved in together. They have different bedtime routines. The author needs silence and darkness, while the boyfriend uses his laptop with ASMR, which the author has misophonia to whispers. The author explains their discomfort, shows a study, and the boyfriend responds by using earphones.\n\nSo, the key points here are mutual adjustment in a living situation. The author is communicating their needs, which is reasonable. Misophonia is a real condition, so the sensitivity to whispers isn't just being picky. The boyfriend is making an effort by using earphones after being told, which shows he's listening. \n\nThe author is asking for adjustments, which is normal when two people live together. They're not being unreasonable; they're addressing specific issues that affect their well-being. The boyfriend's reaction (using earphones) suggests he's accommodating. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
