I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's boyfriend using his laptop with sound and brightness while they're trying to sleep, and the author feeling uncomfortable, especially with ASMR that has whispering. The author asks him to adjust, and the boyfriend responds by using earphones.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a valid need for silence and darkness to sleep. Misophonia-related discomfort with whispering ASMR is a real thing, especially since there's a study mentioned. It's not just about noise but specific sounds causing anxiety.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend has his own bedtime routine. Moving in together means both need to adjust. The author is making requests, which seems reasonable. The boyfriend's response is to use earphones, which addresses the issue without conflict. \n\nIs the author overstepping? Maybe not. They're setting boundaries for their well-being. The boyfriend's reaction (rolling away and using earphones) suggests he respects her needs. The author isn't being unreasonable; they're accommodating each other. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No). The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries to protect their sleep and mental health. Both parties are making adjustments, and the boyfriend is compliant. The key is mutual consideration, which seems present here.\n"
