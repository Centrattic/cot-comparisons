I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop use and ASMR consumption when they're trying to sleep. The author mentions that they have misophonia, specifically to whispering in ASMR, which causes them anxiety and discomfort. They've shown their boyfriend a study on the topic, and he responds by putting in earphones.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what's reasonable in a shared living situation. Both people have different needs for their bedtime routines. The author needs silence and darkness, while the boyfriend uses ASMR as a guilty pleasure. The key here is whether the author's requests are reasonable and if they're being accommodating.\n\nThe author is asking for things like turning down the volume, reducing brightness, using earphones. These are common requests in shared spaces to respect each other's needs. The boyfriend's reaction of rolling over and using earphones after being shown the study suggests he's trying to accommodate. However, the author is repeatedly making these requests, which the boyfriend might find annoying or intrusive. \n\nBut the author has a medical condition (misophonia) that causes genuine distress. They've communicated this and provided evidence. The boyfriend is adjusting his behavior, but maybe not in a way that fully satisfies the author. The question is whether the author is overstepping by constantly reminding him. However, given the health impact, it's reasonable for the author to enforce their needs, especially in a shared bedroom where both need to adjust. \n\nAlso, moving in together means both have to compromise. The boyfriend might need to find alternatives like using earphones or listening to non-whispering ASMR. The author isn't entirely in the wrong because their requests are for their well-being. The boyfriend's guilt about his preference doesn't override the author's health needs. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
