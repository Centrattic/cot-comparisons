I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop usage at night. The main issue here is about conflicting bedtime routines. The author needs silence and darkness, while the boyfriend uses his laptop, including ASMR, which the author has a sensitivity to, possibly misophonia.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is making requests to their partner, which is a reasonable thing to do in a relationship. They explained their needs and even provided a study to help the boyfriend understand. The boyfriend's reaction of rolling away and using earphones suggests he's complying, but maybe not happily.\n\nThe key points: Is the author being unreasonable? They're not asking for a complete stop but for adjustments like turning down volume and brightness. The ASMR issue is a specific sensitivity, and they've communicated it. In a shared living space, mutual accommodation is expected. The boyfriend's choice to watch ASMR is a personal preference, but so is the author's need for quiet and dark. \n\nThe author isn't forbidding the boyfriend from engaging in this activity entirely but is asking for adjustments when they're in the same space. This seems like a normal part of cohabitation. The boyfriend's reaction might indicate he's not happy, but that's his response, not the author's fault. \n\nSo, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong. They're advocating for their needs and health, which is important. Relationships require compromise, and the author is doing their part by communicating and explaining their situation. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
