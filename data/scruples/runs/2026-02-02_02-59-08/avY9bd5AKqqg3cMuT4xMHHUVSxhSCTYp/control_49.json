I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple moving in together, where the author is bothered by her boyfriend's laptop use and ASMR at night. She asks him to turn down the sound and brightness, and he resists sometimes.\n\nFirst, the author mentions having misophonia, especially to whispering. That's a real condition, so her sensitivity has a basis. She's communicated her needs and even showed him a study. He responded by putting in earphones, which is a good sign he's trying to accommodate. But he might not like the constant requests, which could be causing tension.\n\nSince they just moved in together, adjusting to each other's habits is part of the process. The author is setting boundaries for her well-being, which is reasonable. However, if the boyfriend feels his needs aren't being respected, there's a balance to find. The key here is whether the author's actions are reasonable given her condition and communication. She's not being inconsiderate if she's making clear, legitimate requests for her health. So the answer is B.\n"
