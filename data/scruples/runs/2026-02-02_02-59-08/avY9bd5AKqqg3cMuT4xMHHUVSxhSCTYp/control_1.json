I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop use and ASMR consumption when they're trying to sleep. So the situation is that they moved in together, and the boyfriend has a bedtime routine involving YouTube or ASMR, which the author finds really uncomfortable because of misophonia, especially with whispering.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is asking the boyfriend to turn down the sound and brightness, which are reasonable requests for someone needing silence and darkness. The boyfriend's reaction is to roll over and use earphones, which suggests he's trying to comply. However, the author has misophonia related to whispering ASMR, which causes anxiety and discomfort. They showed a study to the boyfriend, which made him put in earphones. The question is whether the author is wrong for making these requests.\n\nNow, considering the context, the author has a legitimate health issue (misophonia) that affects their well-being. Misophonia is a recognized condition, and it's not uncommon for people to have strong negative reactions to certain sounds. The boyfriend, on the other hand, has a personal preference (ASMR) that he enjoys. The author is trying to communicate their needs to maintain their own health and comfort, which is a reasonable thing to do in a relationship. It's about mutual accommodation.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction\u2014putting in earphones after being shown a study\u2014shows that he's making an effort to adjust. The author isn't forbidding him from listening to ASMR entirely, just in their presence. The requests are specific and aimed at reducing the impact on the author's sleep and mental health. There's no indication that the author is being overly controlling or unreasonable; rather, they are addressing a specific issue that affects them personally.\n\nThe boyfriend's guiltiest pleasure suggests he might feel conflicted about giving up ASMR, but the author is not asking him to stop entirely, just to modify it when they're sharing the space. In a new living arrangement, communication is key, and the author is clearly communicating their needs. The boyfriend's compliance (using earphones) shows he respects her boundaries. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. They\u2019re managing their health and ensuring their living environment is conducive to their well-being, which is valid.\n"
