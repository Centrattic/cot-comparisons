I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple moving in together. The boyfriend uses his laptop with sound and bright screen at night, which the author finds disruptive to her sleep. She has misophonia when it comes to whispering ASMR, which makes her anxious and uncomfortable. She's asked him to adjust his habits multiple times, and he responds by putting in earphones.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is clearly communicating her needs due to a specific sensitivity (misophonia). Misophonia is a real condition that causes strong emotional and physical reactions to certain sounds. The boyfriend, on the other hand, has a bedtime routine that he values. They just moved in together, so cohabitation can bring new challenges.\n\nThe key here is whether the author is being unreasonable. She's not banning him from using his laptop entirely but is asking for adjustments like lowering volume and brightness. Those are reasonable requests for a shared living space, especially when one person's habits are affecting the other's well-being. She also provided evidence (a study) to explain her sensitivity, which shows she's trying to be understanding and not just being difficult.\n\nThe boyfriend's response (using earphones) actually solves the problem, so he's accommodating her needs. The author isn't being inconsiderate; she's advocating for her health. The boyfriend's guilt about his \"guilty pleasure\" might be his own issue, but the author's actions are justified given her condition. The question is whether her requests are overstepping. Since they are reasonable and she's made efforts to communicate and find a solution, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B."
