I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his bedtime routine to accommodate their need for silence and darkness. The situation involves the boyfriend listening to ASMR, especially whispering ASMR, which the author finds stressful due to misophonia.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what misophonia is. It's a condition where certain sounds trigger strong negative emotional reactions. The author mentions that they have misophonia specifically towards whispering, which makes sense why ASMR is a problem. They've even shared a study with their boyfriend, which he reacted to by using earphones. That seems like a reasonable step.\n\nThe author is moving in with their boyfriend, so adjusting to each other's habits is part of the process. The boyfriend is using the laptop, which is part of his bedtime routine. The author is asking him to lower the volume, reduce brightness, etc., which are common household adjustments. The key here is whether the author is being unreasonable.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction\u2014rolling away and using earphones\u2014suggests that he's making an effort to comply. The author isn't asking him to stop entirely but to modify his behavior in a way that minimizes disturbance. Since the author has a medical condition (misophonia), their request is more about health and well-being, which is a valid concern.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might feel that his own needs aren't being respected, but the author is clearly trying to communicate their discomfort. The boyfriend's immediate action after seeing the study shows he's willing to accommodate. There's no indication that the author is being overly demanding or that they're not considering the boyfriend's side. They're finding a compromise.\n\nSo, taking into account the medical aspect, communication, and mutual adjustments, the author isn't in the wrong. They're advocating for their health while trying to find solutions. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
