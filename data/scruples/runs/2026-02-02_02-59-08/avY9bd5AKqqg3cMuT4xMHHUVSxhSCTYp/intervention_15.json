I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a couple moving in together where the boyfriend's use of ASMR and laptop sounds during bedtime is causing the author discomfort. The author mentions that the boyfriend's ASMR, especially whispering, triggers misophonia, leading to anxiety and irritation. The author has asked him to adjust his routine, and even showed him a study, which made the boyfriend put on earphones.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has legitimate health concerns\u2014misophonia is a real condition that can cause significant distress. They're trying to communicate their needs to their partner, which is reasonable. On the other hand, the boyfriend has his own bedtime routine that he's trying to maintain. The key here is whether the author is being unreasonable in their requests.\n\nThe author isn't just being a bit annoying; they have a specific, documented sensitivity. They've tried to explain it and even provided evidence (the study), which the boyfriend responded to by using headphones. That suggests that the boyfriend might be accommodating, but perhaps the author is still feeling that their needs aren't met. However, the author is asking the boyfriend to change his habits, which is a common part of living together. If the boyfriend is willing to wear earphones, maybe that's a compromise. But the author keeps nagging, which could be seen as pushy. But given the health aspect, it's more about managing a medical condition rather than just personal preference. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong. They're advocating for their well-being, and the boyfriend's response (using earphones) is a reasonable accommodation. The author isn't being an asshole for expressing their needs, especially when they have a documented sensitivity. The boyfriend might need to adjust further if the earphones aren't enough, but the author's actions are justified here. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
