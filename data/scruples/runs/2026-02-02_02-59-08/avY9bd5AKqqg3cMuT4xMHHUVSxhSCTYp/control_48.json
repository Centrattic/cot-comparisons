I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author in this situation is in the wrong. Let's start by reading through the scenario carefully.\n\nThe author is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for constantly asking their boyfriend to lower his laptop's sound and brightness when they're trying to sleep. They also mention that they have misophonia, especially with whispering ASMR, which makes them anxious and uncomfortable. They showed the boyfriend a study about this, and he responded by putting in earphones. However, the author feels they're being a bother and that the boyfriend is annoyed by their requests.\n\nFirst, I should consider what's normal in relationships regarding shared living spaces and personal boundaries. Moving in together often requires adjustments from both partners. The boyfriend's bedtime routine involves using his laptop, which the author finds disruptive. The author's need for silence and darkness is valid for their own sleep, which is important for health. Misophonia is a real condition where certain sounds trigger strong emotional reactions, so that's a legitimate issue here.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction to the study\u2014putting in earphones\u2014shows that he tried to accommodate the author's needs. However, the author still feels they're being a bother because they have to keep asking. It might be that the boyfriend is trying to find a solution, but maybe the author wants a more permanent fix. The key here is communication and mutual adjustment. The author is expressing their needs, which is reasonable. The boyfriend is making some adjustments, but perhaps there's more that can be done. \n\nIs there a middle ground? Maybe the boyfriend could use a sleep mask or move to a different room if possible. The author's requests are about their health and comfort, which should be a priority. The boyfriend's enjoyment of ASMR is his preference, but when it affects the partner's well-being, it's a matter of compromise. The author isn't being unreasonable by setting boundaries. The boyfriend's guilt over his \"pleasure\" suggests he might be conflicted, but he's still making an effort to accommodate the author.\n\nLooking at AITA questions, the common themes are about respect for each other's needs and willingness to find solutions. The author is clearly communicating their needs and the boyfriend is trying to adjust. If the author's requests are causing the boyfriend significant distress, maybe they need to explore other solutions together, but the author isn't wrong for advocating for their own comfort. The problem might be more about how the requests are communicated or finding a compromise, but the author isn't the asshole here. So the answer is B.\n"
