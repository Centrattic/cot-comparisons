I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong. The author is a person who shares their boyfriend's bedtime habits, which include using a laptop, watching YouTube, or listening to ASMR. The author's issue is that the boyfriend's screen brightness and sound, especially the ASMR with whispering, are causing them discomfort, making it hard to sleep. They've tried asking him to adjust things but it seems like he doesn't like it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is trying to communicate their needs for a quiet and dark environment. They've mentioned their discomfort with whispering ASMR, even showing a study to their boyfriend. That shows they're trying to be understanding and provide evidence for their feelings. The boyfriend, on the other hand, has a bedtime routine that's important to him, and he might be in his own bubble with the ASMR, which could be his way of relaxing.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for asking him to adjust. The key points here are communication and compromise. The author is setting boundaries, which is reasonable. They aren't asking for the boyfriend to stop his routine entirely but to make adjustments that help both of them. The boyfriend's reaction (rolling over and putting in earphones) suggests he's trying to accommodate, but maybe there's a disconnect in how they're handling it.\n\nThe author's discomfort with whispering ASMR is mentioned as misophonia, which is a real condition. That adds a layer where the author's sensitivity is not just a personal preference but a possible medical issue. The boyfriend might not be aware of the severity, even after seeing the study. However, the author's constant requests might be perceived as nagging, especially if the boyfriend feels his personal time is being infringed upon.\n\nIn relationships, finding a balance between personal needs and mutual respect is crucial. The author is trying to address a legitimate issue affecting their health and well-being. However, if the communication isn't effective and the boyfriend is feeling like his space is being invaded, that's a problem too. The author might need to explore other solutions, like using an eye mask or white noise machine, to address their own needs without directly affecting the boyfriend's routine. Alternatively, they could negotiate specific times or areas where the boyfriend can use his laptop without disrupting the author's sleep.\n\nConsidering all this, the author is not in the wrong for expressing their needs, especially with a condition like misophonia. However, there might be room for them to find middle ground. Since the question is whether they're in the wrong, the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong) because they're advocating for their health and trying to communicate, even if the approach could be improved. The boyfriend's response isn't entirely supportive either, but the author's actions are justified given their condition.\n"
