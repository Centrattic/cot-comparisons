I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to think through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about their boyfriend's bedtime habits and how they affect the author's ability to sleep.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that they have misophonia when it comes to whispering ASMR, which causes them anxiety and discomfort. They've shown research to their boyfriend to explain this. The boyfriend's routine involves using his laptop with sound and brightness, which the author finds disruptive. They've asked him to adjust the volume, brightness, etc., but he seems resistant, even after being shown the study about misophonia.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author is trying to create a sleep-conducive environment, has a legitimate sensitivity to certain sounds, and has communicated their needs. The boyfriend, on the other hand, has a different routine and isn't fully accommodating. \n\nI need to consider if the author is being unreasonable. They\u2019re asking for adjustments that are reasonable\u2014like lowering the volume and brightness. The boyfriend's reaction (rolling away and using earphones) suggests he's trying, but maybe not enough. However, the author is consistently asking for these changes. \n\nMisophonia is a real condition, and if the author has that, it's valid to request a quiet environment. The boyfriend's guiltiest pleasure is ASMR, which he's willing to do despite knowing it affects them. \n\nSo, the author isn't being unreasonable. They\u2019re communicating their needs and trying to find a solution. The boyfriend might need to be more considerate, but the author isn't the asshole here. They\u2019re trying to coexist and have a valid reason based on their health. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
