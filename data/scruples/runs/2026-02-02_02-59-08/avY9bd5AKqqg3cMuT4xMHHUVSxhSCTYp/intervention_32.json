  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for always asking my boyfriend to turn his laptop sound and brightness down when I'm trying to sleep and for telling him how anxious, trapped and irritated ASMR makes me when that is his guiltiest pleasure?\nSo we just moved in together, and I knew already his bedtime routine is to watch YouTube, or listen to ASMR, or just be on his laptop in general. I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. I need to analyze the situation carefully.\n\nFirst, the author and her boyfriend moved in together. Her bedtime routine requires silence and darkness, while he uses his laptop with YouTube or ASMR, which she finds disturbing. She asks him to lower the volume, reduce brightness, etc., and mentions her discomfort with whispering ASMR, citing a study on misophonia. He responds by putting in earphones. She's questioning if she's the asshole for setting these boundaries.\n\nI should consider both sides. The author has legitimate needs for a good night's sleep, especially if the boyfriend's activities are disruptive. Misophonia is a real condition, so her sensitivity to certain sounds like whispering ASMR isn't trivial. It's reasonable for her to communicate her needs, especially since they live together now and compromises are necessary.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's habits are part of his bedtime routine, which he might rely on for relaxation. The author is asking him to adjust, which could be seen as a reasonable request if the environment is affecting her health and well-being. The fact that he uses earphones after she explains her issue shows he's trying to accommodate her, which is a positive step.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual adjustment. The author isn't being unreasonable; she's explaining her needs based on her condition and the impact on her. The boyfriend's response is a compromise. There's no indication that she's being overly controlling or disrespectful. Instead, it's about cohabiting and respecting each other's needs. Since she's not forcing him to stop entirely but is asking for adjustments that he can make (like using earphones), she's in the right. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
