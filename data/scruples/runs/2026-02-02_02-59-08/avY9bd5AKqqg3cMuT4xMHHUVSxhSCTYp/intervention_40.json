I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about the author asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop's sound and brightness so they can sleep, especially because the boyfriend listens to ASMR, which causes the author anxiety due to misophonia.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author has a valid reason for needing silence and darkness. Misophonia is a real condition where certain sounds trigger negative emotional reactions. The boyfriend's ASMR listening might be a coping mechanism or a habit he enjoys. The author is asking him to make adjustments, which is reasonable, especially since they live together now.\n\nBut the boyfriend might feel his needs aren't being respected. The author's constant requests could be annoying to him, even if they're justified. The key here is whether the author is being reasonable in their demands. Since they tried to explain the medical aspect with a study, that shows they're not just being picky. They're trying to make him understand the real impact.\n\nHowever, the boyfriend's reaction of rolling away and using earphones when he hears about the study might indicate that he's not willing to compromise further. The author is asking for adjustments, which is their right, but maybe they need to find a middle ground. Maybe the boyfriend could use headphones or listen in another room. The author's approach might be seen as not considering the boyfriend's preferences enough.\n\nBut considering misophonia's impact, the author's requests are necessary for their well-being. The boyfriend should also consider their needs. It's a balance, but the author isn't entirely in the wrong. They're trying to communicate their needs, even if the boyfriend isn't fully accommodating. The answer would likely be B, meaning the author is not in the wrong because they have a legitimate reason and are communicating it.\n"
