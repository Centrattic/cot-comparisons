I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by understanding the situation. The author is moving in with her boyfriend, and they have different bedtime routines. She needs silence and darkness, but he likes to watch YouTube, listen to ASMR, or use his laptop. She asks him to turn down the volume and brightness, which he doesn't seem to like. The main issue is her misophonia triggered by whispering ASMR, which makes her anxious and uncomfortable. She showed him a study about it, and he put in earphones.\n\nFirst, I should consider what misophonia is. It's a condition where certain sounds trigger strong negative emotions. The author has a valid medical reason for being bothered by whispering ASMR. She's not being unreasonable because there's a health aspect involved. However, she's asking her boyfriend to adjust his habits, which he might find frustrating. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is to roll away and use earphones when she shows him the study. That suggests he might be acknowledging her issue but also trying to avoid conflict. On the other hand, the author is clearly communicating her needs, which is important in a relationship. Partners should respect each other's boundaries, especially when it comes to health issues.\n\nHowever, the author might be overstepping if she's not considering her boyfriend's needs. But since the question is about whether she's in the wrong, I need to see if her actions are justified. She's trying to accommodate her medical condition by asking him to adjust, which is reasonable. The boyfriend's guiltiest pleasure is ASMR, so he might be resistant to giving it up. But the author isn't asking him to stop entirely, just to adjust when she's trying to sleep. That seems fair.\n\nIn a shared living situation, both partners have to make compromises. The author is asserting her needs, which is necessary for her well-being. The boyfriend's reaction might indicate that he's not happy with the requests, but that doesn't mean the author is wrong. It's about finding a middle ground. Since she's communicated her issue and provided information about her condition, she's done her part. The boyfriend's response is his choice, but the author isn't at fault for standing up for her needs. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
