I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop usage and ASMR consumption during bedtime. \n\nFirst, the context: They moved in together. The author needs silence and darkness to sleep, while the boyfriend has a different routine involving YouTube or ASMR. The author is asking him to lower the volume, reduce brightness, etc., which the boyfriend seems to dislike. The author also has a specific issue with whispering ASMR due to misophonia, a condition that makes certain sounds uncomfortable. They showed a study to the boyfriend, who then used earphones.\n\nNow, considering the key points. Misophonia is a real condition, and the author's discomfort isn't just a personal preference. They made an effort to explain their issue with the study, which shows they're trying to be understanding. The boyfriend's response (using earphones) suggests he tried to accommodate. However, the author's repeated requests might be seen as nagging if not handled sensitively. \n\nBut is it the author's fault? They have a legitimate condition and a right to their sleep environment. The boyfriend's guiltiest pleasure is ASMR, but that shouldn't override the partner's health. The author is setting boundaries for their well-being, which is reasonable. However, the boyfriend might feel his habits are being unfairly restricted. \n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Since they have a medical reason and are communicating their needs, it's more about finding a compromise. If the boyfriend is using earphones and adjusting brightness, maybe the author could find another solution, but the core issue is the author's right to a peaceful sleep. So the answer is B (not in the wrong), as they're advocating for their health.\n"
