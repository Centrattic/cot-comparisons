I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" question is in the wrong. The situation involves the author asking her boyfriend to adjust his bedtime routine\u2014like lowering the laptop's brightness and volume, and avoiding whispering ASMR\u2014because it affects her sleep and causes anxiety.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a valid reason: she needs silence and darkness to sleep, which is a common requirement. Misophonia is a real condition, and she mentioned a study showing how people with misophonia react to certain sounds. That adds credibility to her request.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's routine is part of his wind-down before bed. He uses ASMR, which is a personal preference. The author is asking him to modify it, which might be inconvenient for him. The key here is whether the author's requests are reasonable given the shared living space.\n\nMoving in together usually means compromising. The author is trying to communicate her needs, which is important. However, the boyfriend's reaction\u2014rolling away and putting in earphones\u2014suggests he might be avoiding the issue rather than finding a solution. Maybe they need to find a middle ground, like using a white noise machine or earbuds for him while she sleeps, but that's not part of the question.\n\nThe author's actions might be seen as considerate because she's explaining her condition and showing the study. She's not just being annoying without reason. The boyfriend's guilt about his pleasure (ASMR) might be a red flag, indicating he's reluctant to change, but it's not clear if he's making an effort to accommodate her.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Probably not. She's addressing a legitimate issue that affects her well-being. The problem might be more about the boyfriend not being willing to compromise, but the question is about the author's actions. Since she's making a reasonable request and has provided context, she's likely not the asshole. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
