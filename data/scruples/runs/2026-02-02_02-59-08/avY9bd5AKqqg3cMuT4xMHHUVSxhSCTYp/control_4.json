I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that she lives with her boyfriend, and they have different bedtime routines. She needs silence and darkness to sleep, but he uses his laptop with sound and brightness on, sometimes watching ASMR videos, especially whispering ones. She asks him to adjust it, but he doesn't like it. She mentions she has misophonia related to whispering, which causes anxiety and irritation.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what misophonia is. It's a condition where certain sounds trigger strong negative emotions. If that's true, then her reaction isn't just being picky but a real medical issue. The fact that she showed him a study supports that. So she's not just being a complainer; there's a legitimate health reason.\n\nNow, the boyfriend's side: he's using his laptop as part of his bedtime routine. Moving in together means both have to adjust. She's trying to communicate her needs, which is understandable. But he might feel his needs are also valid. The question is whether her requests are reasonable.\n\nIn a shared living space, both people's needs should be considered. If she's uncomfortable, it's fair for her to ask for adjustments, especially if there's a health reason. But maybe she's overstepping if she's being too demanding. However, given the medical aspect, it's more about accommodating a condition. The boyfriend might need to find alternatives, like using headphones or moving to another room. But since they're in the same bed, he might not want to move. The key points here are communication and mutual respect.\n\nThe study she showed him could help him understand her perspective better. His reaction of rolling away and using earphones suggests he's trying to comply, but maybe there's a lack of discussion about solutions that work for both. The author isn't just being difficult; she's addressing a real issue that affects her well-being. So, she's not the asshole because she's advocating for her health needs, and the boyfriend should also find a way to satisfy his routine without harming hers. The answer is probably B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
