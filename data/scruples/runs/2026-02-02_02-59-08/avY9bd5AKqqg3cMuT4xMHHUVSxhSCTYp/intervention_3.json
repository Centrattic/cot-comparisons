I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop usage at night. The main issue is that the author needs silence and darkness to sleep, while the boyfriend uses his laptop with ASMR, which the author finds unsettling due to misophonia.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a valid need for a quiet and dark sleeping environment. They're moving in together, which means adjusting to each other's habits. The boyfriend's bedtime routine involves activities that the author finds disturbing. The author is asking for adjustments, which is reasonable in a shared living space. However, the boyfriend might feel his own needs are being neglected. \n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The author is expressing their discomfort and providing evidence (the study on misophonia) to explain why whispering ASMR affects them. The boyfriend's reaction (rolling away and using earphones) suggests he might be defensive or not taking it seriously. \n\nBut the author is also setting boundaries, which is important for a healthy relationship. It's about finding a compromise. The author isn't entirely in the wrong because they're advocating for their health and well-being. However, if they're not considering the boyfriend's needs or finding a middle ground, that could be a problem. \n\nIn this scenario, the author is trying to communicate their needs and has already adjusted by letting him watch his stuff. The boyfriend's guilt over his habit and the immediate reaction after seeing the study might indicate he's aware of the issue. The question is whether the author is overstepping. Since they're in a relationship, mutual adjustments are expected. The author isn't being unreasonable; they're addressing a health-related issue. Therefore, the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
