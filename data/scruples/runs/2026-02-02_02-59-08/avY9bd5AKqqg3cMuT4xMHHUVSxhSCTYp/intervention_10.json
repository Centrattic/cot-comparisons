I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop usage at night because it's affecting the author's sleep. The boyfriend's routine includes watching YouTube, ASMR, etc., which the author finds disruptive, especially the whispering ASMR.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is moving in together, which means sharing a living space. They need a quiet and dark environment to sleep, which is a reasonable expectation. The boyfriend has his own preferences for bedtime, which he's been doing before moving in. Now that they're together, adjustments are necessary.\n\nThe author has communicated their needs, which is important. They mentioned explaining their discomfort with the ASMR, even showing a study. The boyfriend's reaction was to put earphones in, which might indicate he's respecting their request. But the author is getting frustrated because they have to ask every night, and the boyfriend seems not to like the reminders.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual adjustment. The author is advocating for their own needs, which is valid. However, maybe the author could explore other solutions, like using separate bedrooms if possible, or designated areas. But since the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, the main issue is if their requests are unreasonable.\n\nThe boyfriend is adjusting by using earphones, but maybe there's more he can do. However, the author is also making repeated requests, which could be seen as nagging. The boyfriend's reaction (rolling away and using earphones) might be his way of complying. But the author feels like they're being nagged, which could mean they need to find a more effective way to communicate without constant reminders.\n\nThe aspect of misophonia is important. The author has a medical condition that makes certain sounds uncomfortable. That adds weight to their request. However, it's also about mutual respect and finding a balance. The author isn't wrong for having needs, but they might need to consider the boyfriend's needs as well, perhaps discussing compromises.\n\nIn moving in together, both parties should be willing to adjust. The author is making their needs known, which is necessary, but maybe not in a way that's considerate of the boyfriend's feelings. The boyfriend's guilt about his \"pleasure\" (ASMR) could be a factor, leading to tension.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? I think not. They have valid reasons related to their health and sleep needs. However, the way they communicate these needs might need to improve. But in terms of right or wrong, the author isn't the asshole because they're addressing legitimate concerns. The boyfriend also needs to adjust, but the author isn't the one at fault here.\n"
