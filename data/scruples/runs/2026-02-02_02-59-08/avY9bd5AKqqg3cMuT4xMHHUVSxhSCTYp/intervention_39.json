I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple living together, where the author is asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop usage at night because it's affecting her sleep. \n\nFirst, the author mentions they have misophonia, especially to whispering ASMR. They've explained this to their boyfriend, shown him a study, and he responds by putting in earphones. But the author keeps asking him to lower volume, adjust brightness, etc., every night. The boyfriend seems to be annoyed by these requests.\n\nThe user thinks the author might be in the wrong. Let me consider both sides. On one hand, the author has a valid health concern (misophonia) that affects their well-being. They're communicating their needs and trying to find solutions. On the other hand, the boyfriend's bedtime routine is a personal preference, and if the author is constantly making requests, it could be seen as overstepping, especially if he's already making adjustments like using earphones.\n\nBut the key here is that the author's discomfort is medically recognized as misophonia. They're not just being picky; there's a genuine physiological reaction. The boyfriend's response of putting in earphones is a compromise, but maybe the author still feels the need to ask because the brightness or other aspects are still an issue. \n\nHowever, the boyfriend might feel that once he's using earphones and isn't disturbing her with sound, the brightness shouldn't be a problem. But the author is sensitive to the screen's brightness, which is a legitimate issue. They might need a different setup, like a night light or covering the screen. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for persistently asking for adjustments even after some compromise? The boyfriend's reaction (rolling away and using earphones) might indicate he's trying to accommodate, but the author still feels the need to ask again. Maybe there's a lack of alternative solutions being explored together. \n\nAlternatively, if the boyfriend is using earphones, then the sound isn't an issue, but the screen's brightness remains. The author's requests about brightness could be reasonable. However, if he's already made an effort and the author keeps nagging, that could be wearing on him. \n\nBut given that the author has a medical condition, their needs should be prioritized. The boyfriend might need to find a way to adjust his setup to minimize both sound and light. The author isn't wrong for advocating for their health. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong). But I need to be careful. If the author is making constant demands without considering the boyfriend's needs, that could tip the balance. However, the scenario suggests that the author is making reasonable requests due to a health issue. Therefore, the boyfriend might need to find a solution that works for both, but that doesn't mean the author is wrong to ask.\n"
