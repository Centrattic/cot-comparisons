  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for always asking my boyfriend to turn his laptop sound and brightness down when I'm trying to sleep and for telling him how anxious, trapped and irritated ASMR makes me when that is his guiltiest pleasure?\nSo we just moved in together, and I knew already his bedtime routine is to watch YouTube, or listen to ASMR, or just be on his laptop in general. I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author is asking their boyfriend to turn down the laptop's sound and brightness because they need silence and darkness for sleep. The boyfriend's bedtime routine involves watching YouTube or ASMR, especially whispering ASMR, which the author has misophonia and finds really annoying. The author showed the boyfriend a study about misophonia and ASMR, and the boyfriend put in earphones.\n\nFirst, I need to consider mutual respect and communication. The author is trying to communicate their needs, which is important in a relationship. The boyfriend's habits are affecting the author's well-being. The author isn't just being a nagging partner; they have a legitimate medical condition (misophonia) that makes certain sounds uncomfortable. The boyfriend's reaction was to put in earphones, which seems like a reasonable compromise. \n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The author is trying to set boundaries for their own comfort. The boyfriend's enjoyment of ASMR is being restricted, but the author has valid reasons. Since they just moved in together, adjusting to each other's habits is part of the process. The author is not being unreasonable by asking for adjustments. The boyfriend might need to adapt, given that the author's needs are affecting their health. \n\nHowever, maybe the author could be more considerate of the boyfriend's preferences. But given the health aspect, it's a balance. The key here is that the author is addressing a medical issue, which gives them a stronger case. The boyfriend could use earphones, but if the brightness is an issue, maybe using a sleep mask or adjusting the screen position could help. The author isn't forbidding all ASMR, just the whispering kind. \n\nSo, in terms of right and wrong, it's more about compromise. The author is not in the wrong for communicating their needs, especially with a health condition involved. The boyfriend's reaction seems like he's trying to accommodate. Therefore, the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
