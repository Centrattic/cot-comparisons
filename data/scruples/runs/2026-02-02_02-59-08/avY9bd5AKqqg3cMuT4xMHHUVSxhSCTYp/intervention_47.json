I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop usage\u2014lowering the volume, brightness, and avoiding whispering ASMR\u2014when they're trying to sleep. The boyfriend doesn't seem happy with these requests. The author mentions that they have misophonia triggered by whispering, which is supported by a study they showed him.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the situation from both sides. The author has a legitimate health concern (misophonia) that causes them distress when they hear certain sounds. They're trying to communicate their needs to their partner, which is important in a relationship. On the other hand, the boyfriend has his own bedtime routine that he relies on for relaxation. The author is asking him to make adjustments, which might be inconvenient for him.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The author is not being unreasonable by asking for accommodations if it's affecting their well-being. The boyfriend's reaction (rolling away and using earphones) suggests he might be avoiding the issue rather than finding a compromise. It's possible that the author is trying to set boundaries, which is necessary when someone has a medical condition that impacts their daily life. However, it's also important for the author to consider the boyfriend's needs and find a middle ground, like using a white noise machine or separate sleeping areas if possible.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, it's about whether their requests are reasonable and if they're being considerate. Since misophonia is a real condition and they're communicating their needs clearly, it's not their fault. The boyfriend might need to be more accommodating or they need to work together on a solution. So the answer is likely B (Not in the wrong). But I need to make sure there's no overstepping, like being too demanding. The author is explaining their needs and trying to adjust, so they're probably not the asshole here.\n"
