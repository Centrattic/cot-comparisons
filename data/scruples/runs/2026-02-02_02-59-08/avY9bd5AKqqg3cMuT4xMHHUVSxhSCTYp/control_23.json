I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a boyfriend and his bedtime habits. The author is asking if they're being unreasonable by asking their boyfriend to lower the laptop's sound and brightness so they can sleep. Also, the boyfriend listens to ASMR with whispering, which the author has misophonia and finds really annoying. They showed a study, and the boyfriend put in earphones. The author is wondering if they're an asshole for setting these boundaries.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author and their partner moved in together. They have different bedtime needs: the author needs silence and darkness, while the boyfriend uses his laptop with sound and brightness. The author is asking for adjustments, which is understandable. Misophonia is a real condition, so the reaction to whispering ASMR isn't just being picky. The author did communicate their feelings, even showing a study, and the boyfriend responded by using earphones. That suggests the boyfriend is trying to accommodate.\n\nAre the author's requests reasonable? Living together means both need to adjust. The author isn't asking for total abstinence from ASMR, just not during their shared sleep time. The boyfriend could use earphones or adjust the volume. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries to protect their sleep and well-being. Misophonia adds a medical aspect, making the sensitivity valid. The boyfriend's immediate response shows he's willing to comply. So the author isn't being unreasonable. The answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
