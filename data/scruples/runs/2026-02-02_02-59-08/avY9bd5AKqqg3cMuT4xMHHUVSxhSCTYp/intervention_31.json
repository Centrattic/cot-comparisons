I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's see. The situation is about the author and their boyfriend moving in together. The author's bedtime routine requires silence and darkness, while the boyfriend likes to watch YouTube or listen to ASMR. The author asks him to adjust the volume and brightness, which the boyfriend doesn't like. The author also mentions that they have misophonia specifically with whispering ASMR, which makes them feel anxious and irritated. They showed him a study, and he put on earphones.\n\nFirst, I should understand what misophonia is. From what I know, it's a condition where certain sounds trigger strong emotional or physical reactions, like anxiety or anger. Whispering and soft sounds are common triggers. So if the author has a medical condition, that's a valid reason for their discomfort. \n\nThe boyfriend's preference is ASMR, which he uses as a guilt pleasure. The author is asking him to use earphones or turn it down. The boyfriend is responsive after being shown the study, which makes me wonder if that's a better approach. The author is not just being averse to noise, but specifically to whispering, which is a known trigger. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The boyfriend's actions are affecting the author's well-being because of a medical condition. The author is trying to communicate their needs, which the boyfriend eventually respects by using earphones. \n\nBut maybe there's a nuance here. The author is \"always\" asking him to adjust, which could be seen as nagging. However, if it's a recurring issue that genuinely impacts their health, it's not just about personal preference. The boyfriend might be expected to accommodate a partner's medical needs, especially since they are in a shared living space. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might feel that his needs are also important. ASMR could be his way of relaxing, and maybe he's not using earphones because he's in a bed without much privacy, like a room with a shared wall. But the author showed him the study, and he complied, so perhaps he's not being resistant. \n\nThe key points here are: the author has a medical condition (misophonia) causing distress, they are communicating their needs, and the boyfriend is making adjustments. The author isn't outright banning ASMR but asking for adjustments that would minimize the impact. In a shared living situation, it's reasonable for both partners to find compromises. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If their requests are based on a legitimate health issue and they're being respectful, then probably not. The boyfriend's reaction of rolling away might indicate some frustration, but the author's needs are valid. The fact that he eventually uses earphones shows he's willing to accommodate. Therefore, the answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
