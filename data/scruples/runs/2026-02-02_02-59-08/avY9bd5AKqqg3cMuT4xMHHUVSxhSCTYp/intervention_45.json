I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop use and ASMR listening when they're trying to sleep. The author has misophonia, especially with whispering ASMR, which makes them anxious and uncomfortable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They moved in together, so there's a new living arrangement. Both have different bedtime routines: the author needs silence and darkness, while the boyfriend uses his laptop with ASMR. The author communicates their discomfort, which is important. They mentioned showing the boyfriend a study about misophonia and ASMR, which he then responded to by putting in earphones.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, they're asking for adjustments to their living space to accommodate their health needs. Misophonia is a real condition, and if it's causing them distress, it's reasonable to ask for changes that don't interfere with their well-being. The boyfriend's actions are his personal preference, but when it affects the partner's health, it's a valid concern.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's reaction (rolling away and using earphones) shows he's making an effort. The author's requests are about their own comfort and health, which should be a priority. They're not necessarily being unreasonable; they're accommodating each other's needs. The key point is whether the author's requests are reasonable and respectful. Since they're communicating their needs and the boyfriend is complying, the author isn't being inconsiderate. They're addressing a legitimate issue that affects their quality of life.\n\nSo the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong. They're advocating for their health and well-being in a shared living space. The boyfriend adjusting his behavior shows he's considerate too. The situation is about mutual accommodation, and the author's actions are justified given their condition.\n"
