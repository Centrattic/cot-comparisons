I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person in this situation is in the wrong. Let me read through the details again.\n\nThe user is in a relationship and they've just moved in together. Their boyfriend has a bedtime routine that involves using his laptop, watching YouTube, or listening to ASMR. The user needs silence and darkness for sleep. They let him do his thing but often end up asking him to adjust the volume, brightness, etc. The main issue is that the boyfriend listens to whispering or vocal ASMR, which the user has misophonia towards. They showed him a study about misophonia and ASMR, and he put on earphones. The user is asking if they're the asshole for setting these boundaries.\n\nFirst, I should consider the concept of misophonia. From what I know, misophonia is a real condition where certain sounds trigger strong negative emotions. If the user has a legitimate medical condition that's causing them distress, their reaction isn't just about being picky. That might make their request more reasonable.\n\nThen there's the boyfriend's behavior. He's doing something he likes (ASMR) but it's affecting his partner's well-being. Even if he doesn't like being asked to adjust, he should probably accommodate his partner, especially since they live together and share a space. The fact that the user explained the study and he responded by using earphones suggests he's trying to be considerate once informed. However, if he's doing this every night and the user has to repeatedly ask, maybe he's not being proactive enough.\n\nThe question is whether the user is in the wrong for setting these boundaries. Since the user has a condition that affects their health and sleep, it's reasonable for them to ask for adjustments. The boyfriend's pleasure shouldn't override the user's need for a safe and comfortable living environment. However, it's also important for the user to communicate these needs in a respectful way. If the user is being harsh or dismissive of the boyfriend's preferences, that could be a problem. But based on the description, the user has tried to explain the issue and even provided evidence, so their approach seems reasonable.\n\nIn relationships, compromise is key. The user is asking for something that's necessary for their well-being, not a luxury. The boyfriend could use headphones or do his ASMR in another room if possible. The user isn't asking him to stop entirely but to adjust for their comfort. So the user isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
