I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop's sound and brightness because it's affecting their sleep. The main points are misophonia related to whispering ASMR and needing silence and darkness.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a valid health issue\u2014misophonia, which is a real condition that can cause significant distress. They provided a study to back this up, which shows they're trying to communicate their needs clearly. It's reasonable for them to ask for adjustments when their health is involved.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend has his own bedtime routine he's used to. Moving in together means both need flexibility. However, the author's requests are about creating a shared living environment where both can be comfortable. The boyfriend's immediate reaction to put in earphones suggests he's making an effort, but maybe there's more to discuss about mutual adjustments.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's requests are unreasonable. Since misophonia is a medical condition and the author is seeking a solution that's necessary for their well-being, their actions are justified. They're not just being picky; they're dealing with a legitimate issue. The boyfriend should be accommodating, especially since they moved in together, which implies shared living arrangements and compromise from both sides.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't the asshole. They're advocating for their health needs, and it's reasonable to ask for a peaceful sleep environment. The answer should be B.\n"
