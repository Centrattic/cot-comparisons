I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA scenario is in the wrong. So the situation is about a couple who just moved in together. The boyfriend uses his laptop with sound and bright screen at night, which the girl finds disturbing because she needs silence and darkness for sleep. She asks him to adjust things, like lowering the volume, brightness, etc. He doesn't like it, and when she mentions her discomfort with whispering ASMR (which he likes), he reacts by putting in earphones.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girl has a valid need for a conducive sleep environment. Misophonia is a real condition, and her reaction to the ASMR isn't just being annoying. She even showed a study to him, which shows she's trying to explain her situation. On the other hand, the boyfriend has his own bedtime routine and might feel his preferences aren't respected. They moved in together, so this is about cohabitation and adjusting to each other's needs.\n\nThe question is whether her asking for adjustments is reasonable. Since she's explaining her health-related issues (misophonia) and her need for a specific sleep environment, it's reasonable for her to request accommodations. However, the boyfriend's reaction (rolling away and putting in earphones) might indicate he's not open to compromise. But she's not the one refusing to adjust. She's trying to communicate her needs, which is important in a relationship. If he's resistant, maybe he's the one being difficult, but the question is about her being the asshole. Since she's making an effort to explain and find solutions (like showing the study), she's not being unreasonable. So the answer would be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
