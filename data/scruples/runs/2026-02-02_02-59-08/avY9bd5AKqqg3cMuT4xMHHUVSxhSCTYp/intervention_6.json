  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for always asking my boyfriend to turn his laptop sound and brightness down when I'm trying to sleep and for telling him how anxious, trapped and irritated ASMR makes me when that is his guiltiest pleasure?\nSo we just moved in together, and I knew already his bedtime routine is to watch YouTube, or listen to ASMR, or just be on his laptop in general. I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for their situation with their boyfriend's ASMR and laptop use. The author mentions they have misophonia, especially to whispering ASMR, which causes them anxiety and discomfort. They've tried to communicate this and adjust things, like asking him to lower the volume and brightness. The boyfriend responds by putting on earphones when he sees the study.\n\nFirst, the author is trying to maintain their own well-being by addressing a legitimate sensitivity. Misophonia is a real condition, and it's valid to feel that way. The key here is communication and mutual respect. The author isn't just being picky; they have a genuine health issue. The boyfriend's reaction of rolling away and using earphones suggests he's trying to accommodate, but maybe not fully understanding the issue. However, the author is within their rights to ask for adjustments in their shared living space, especially when it affects their mental health. The boyfriend might need to find alternative ways to enjoy his ASMR without disturbing the author, like using headphones consistently. Since the author is explaining their needs and providing evidence (the study), they're being reasonable. The boyfriend's irritation might stem from not realizing the severity, but that doesn't make the author wrong for setting boundaries. So, the answer is B\u2014author isn't in the wrong.\n"
