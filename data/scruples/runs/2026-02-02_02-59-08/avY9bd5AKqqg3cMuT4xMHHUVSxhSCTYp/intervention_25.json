I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully. The author is moving in with their boyfriend and has different bedtime needs. The boyfriend likes to watch YouTube, listen to ASMR, or use his laptop, which the author finds disruptive. The author asks him to lower the sound and brightness, but it seems like the boyfriend isn't happy with these requests. The author specifically mentions that ASMR with whispering makes them anxious and has misophonia, so they showed a study to the boyfriend, who then put in earphones.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for making these requests. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nFirst, moving in together means adjusting to each other's habits. The author has a legitimate need for silence and darkness to sleep, which is important for their health. Misophonia is a real condition that can cause significant distress, especially with specific sounds like whispering. The author isn't just being sensitive; it's a medical issue. They tried to communicate their needs and even provided evidence to the boyfriend, which shows they're trying to be understanding and not just imposing their will.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend has his own bedtime routine that he's attached to. The author's constant requests might be frustrating for him. However, since they live together, some compromise is necessary. The author isn't preventing him from doing his routine entirely but is asking for adjustments that allow both of them to sleep. The boyfriend choosing to use earphones after being shown the study suggests he's willing to accommodate, which is positive.\n\nThe key points are the author's health needs and their effort to communicate and find solutions. The boyfriend's reaction might indicate he's not happy, but the author isn't being unreasonable. They are making reasonable requests to coexist in the same living space. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong here.\n"
