I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to lower his laptop's sound and brightness when they're trying to sleep, especially when he listens to ASMR that makes them uncomfortable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. They moved in together, so living arrangements can be tricky. The boyfriend uses his laptop in bed with ASMR or YouTube, which is his bedtime routine. The author needs silence and darkness, which is their routine. They have misophonia, a real condition that causes discomfort with certain sounds, like whispering. They mentioned a study showing that people with misophonia react negatively to ASMR, which they shared with their partner. He responded by putting in earphones.\n\nThe key points here are mutual accommodation and communication. The author explained their needs and provided a study, which shows they tried to be understanding. The boyfriend adjusted by using earphones, which is a reasonable compromise. However, the author feels they're always having to ask, which might make them feel like they're the problem. But since they're in a relationship, it's about finding a balance where both can coexist. The boyfriend's response (using earphones) suggests he's making an effort too. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. They have a valid reason due to misophonia, communicated their needs, and the boyfriend is making adjustments. Relationships require both parties to compromise. The author isn't being unreasonable here. They're not demanding he stop entirely but asking for adjustments. The boyfriend's actions show he's listening. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
