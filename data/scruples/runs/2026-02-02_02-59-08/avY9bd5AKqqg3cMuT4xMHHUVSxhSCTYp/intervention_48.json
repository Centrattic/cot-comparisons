I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop use and ASMR consumption while they're trying to sleep.\n\nFirst, the context: They moved in together. The boyfriend's bedtime routine involves using his laptop with sound and brightness, which the author finds disruptive. The author has misophonia when it comes to whispering ASMR, leading to anxiety and discomfort. They've shown research to the boyfriend, who then uses earphones.\n\nThe author is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for making these requests. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author has legitimate health issues (misophonia) that cause real distress. They're communicating their needs, which is reasonable in a relationship. They've provided evidence (the study) to explain why this affects them, which shows they're trying to be understanding and not just being finicky.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend has his own preferences and habits. However, when someone moves in together, adjusting for each other's needs is part of cohabitation. The boyfriend's response (using earphones) shows he's making an effort, which is good. But the author's constant requests might be seen as nagging if not balanced with flexibility. However, given the health aspect, it's a valid concern.\n\nThe key points: The author's requests are based on a medical condition, they've communicated clearly, and the boyfriend is already taking steps to accommodate. The author isn't just being picky; they have a documented issue. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend might also need to adapt, but the author's actions are justified. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
