I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his bedtime routine to accommodate their sensitivity to ASMR and laptop noise. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has moved in together. The boyfriend uses his laptop in bed, sometimes with ASMR, which the author is sensitive to. The author has ASMR-induced anxiety and misophonia, especially with whispering. They've tried to communicate their needs, shown research, and the boyfriend responds by putting in earphones.\n\nThe key points here are communication, mutual respect, and shared living arrangements. The author is setting boundaries based on their health and comfort, which is reasonable. The boyfriend is using his own devices, but the noise and light affect the author. They've given examples of adjustments, like lowering volume or using earphones, which are practical and not overly demanding.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction of rolling away and using earphones suggests he's trying to comply. The author isn't asking for him to stop entirely but to make compromises. The fact that they've discussed it and the boyfriend is making efforts shows that the author is not inconsiderate. \n\nMisophonia can be a legitimate condition causing distress, so the author has a valid reason. In a shared living situation, both partners need to make adjustments. The author is being proactive in communicating their needs, which is healthy. There's no indication of being unreasonable here. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
