  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for always asking my boyfriend to turn his laptop sound and brightness down when I'm trying to sleep and for telling him how anxious, trapped and irritated ASMR makes me when that is his guiltiest pleasure?\nSo we just moved in together, and I knew already his bedtime routine is to watch YouTube, or listen to ASMR, or just be on his laptop in general. I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to lower his laptop's sound and brightness. The boyfriend uses ASMR, which the author has misophonia towards, especially with whispering.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. They just moved in together, so cohabitation can bring new challenges. The author has a specific need for silence and darkness, which is understandable. The boyfriend's habits are conflicting with that. The author is asking for adjustments, which is pretty normal in a relationship when there are differing needs.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is to roll away and use earphones, which seems like he's trying to comply. The author shared a study about misophonia and ASMR, which shows they're trying to explain the issue. It's important to note that misophonia is a real condition that can cause strong negative reactions to certain sounds.\n\nNow, the key question: Is the author wrong for setting these boundaries? In relationships, communication is key. The author is clearly communicating their needs and the impact of the ASMR on their mental state. They're not being unreasonable by asking for adjustments that help them sleep, which is a legitimate need. The boyfriend is making an effort to accommodate by using earphones, so it seems like a mutual effort is happening.\n\nThe author isn't forbidding the boyfriend from doing what he likes; they're just asking for it to be done in a way that minimizes the disturbance. That's a reasonable request. The boyfriend might be frustrated, but the author isn't in the wrong here. They're advocating for their well-being, which is important. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
