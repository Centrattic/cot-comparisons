I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop use and ASMR consumption because it's affecting their sleep. The boyfriend's bedtime routine involves watching YouTube or ASMR, which the author finds disruptive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a legitimate need for silence and darkness to sleep. Misophonia, especially regarding whispering, is a real condition that can cause significant distress. The author mentioned showing a study to the boyfriend, so they're aware of the issue. The boyfriend's reaction was to put on earphones, which suggests he's trying to accommodate.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might feel his needs are also valid. Moving in together often requires compromise. But the author's health and well-being are important here. If the boyfriend isn't respecting those boundaries, that's a problem. The key is whether the author is being unreasonable. Since they've communicated their needs and tried to find solutions (like adjusting volume and brightness), it seems reasonable. The boyfriend's guilt about his preference might be a factor, but the author isn't at fault for protecting their health. So the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
