I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple who just moved in together, and the boyfriend's bedtime habits (like using his laptop with sound and brightness) are interfering with the author's need for silence and darkness to sleep. The author has asked him to adjust these things, and when he listens to ASMR, especially whispering ones, it causes her misophonia symptoms. She even showed him a study about it, and he used earphones.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is trying to communicate her needs, which are important for her well-being and sleep. Misophonia is a real condition that can cause significant distress, so her reaction isn't just being overly sensitive. She's made an effort to explain her feelings and provided evidence to help him understand why it's a problem. That seems reasonable.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend has his own bedtime routine that he enjoys. Moving in together often requires compromises. However, if the author's health and comfort are being affected, it's a valid concern. The boyfriend's response of using earphones suggests he's trying to accommodate her, which is positive. The author is asking him to make adjustments that are within his control (like turning down the volume or using headphones) rather than stopping his activities entirely. \n\nSo, the key points here are communication and compromise. The author is clearly expressing her needs, which is important in a relationship. The boyfriend is making an effort to adjust, but maybe there's room for more understanding from both sides. However, the author isn't being unreasonable in her requests given her specific condition. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
