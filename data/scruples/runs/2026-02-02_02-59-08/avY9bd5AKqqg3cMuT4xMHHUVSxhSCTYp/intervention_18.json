I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" story is wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop habits when they're trying to sleep. The author mentions that they have misophonia, specifically triggered by whispering ASMR, which makes them anxious and uncomfortable. They show their partner a study about it, and the partner responds by putting in earphones.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is trying to communicate their needs clearly, which is important in a relationship. They're not just making a random request but have a legitimate sensitivity. Misophonia is a real condition, and the author is doing their part to explain it with evidence from a study. That shows they're trying to be understanding and not just being difficult.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's bedtime routine is his way to relax. It's understandable he might feel his habits are being criticized. However, he does comply by using earphones, which suggests he's making an effort to accommodate his partner. The author's requests are specific and reasonable: lower volume, less brightness, maybe using earphones. These aren't unreasonable adjustments, especially in a shared living space where both need to compromise.\n\nIs there a conflict here? Well, relationships require compromise. The author isn't asking for a complete halt of the boyfriend's routine but adjustments that minimize disturbance. The boyfriend is making changes, so the author isn't being unreasonable. If the boyfriend were resistant or not making any effort, the situation might be different. But since he is, the author is acting appropriately by advocating for their well-being.\n\nAlso, the author is upfront about their feelings and explains the reason behind their requests. That communication is key. It's not just nagging but a health-related issue. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. The boyfriend's actions show he's willing to adapt, which is a good sign. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
