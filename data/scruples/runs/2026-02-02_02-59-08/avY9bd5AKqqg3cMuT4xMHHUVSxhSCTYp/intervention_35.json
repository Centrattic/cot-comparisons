I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in their situation with their boyfriend's bedtime habits. So the author and their boyfriend just moved in together. The boyfriend uses his laptop late at night, sometimes with ASMR, which the author finds really uncomfortable because they have misophonia, especially with whispering. The author asks him to lower the volume, adjust brightness, or use headphones. The boyfriend does that when told, like putting earphones in after seeing the study. But the author is worried they're being an asshole for constantly making these requests.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what misophonia is. It's a condition where certain sounds trigger strong negative emotions, like anxiety or irritation. So if the author has a medical condition that makes whispering ASMR uncomfortable, that might be a valid reason for their request. However, the boyfriend is using his laptop, which is a personal activity. The question is whether the author's demands are reasonable or if they're overstepping.\n\nThe author mentions that their needs are silence and darkness for sleep, which is a common requirement. They let him watch YouTube but are bothered by the sound and brightness. They ask him to adjust, which he does when he listens to ASMR. It seems like he's compliant, so maybe the issue is that the author is frequently nagging him, making him feel like he's being told what to do. The author's main conflict is about the ASMR with whispering, which they linked to a study. The boyfriend's reaction was to put earphones in, so he tried to accommodate.\n\nBut the author is asking if they're the asshole. The key points are: 1) The author has a legitimate sensitivity (misophonia) that's causing them discomfort. 2) They're asking for reasonable adjustments (volume, brightness, headphones) that don't require him to stop using his laptop entirely. 3) He complies when he knows it's bothering her, so he's trying to be considerate. 4) The author feels they need to \"tell him no\" so often, which might be frustrating for him.\n\nIn some cases, if the other person is making a genuine effort to accommodate, the author might not be in the wrong. But if the requests are excessive or not mutual (like the boyfriend isn't trying to adjust enough), maybe there's an issue. The author is trying to create a sleep environment they need, which is important for health. The boyfriend's use of headphones shows he's willing to make changes. However, the author is perhaps making a lot of requests each night, which could be seen as not respecting his personal time or preferences. But given the medical condition, it's a valid concern.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they're addressing a real issue that affects their well-being. The boyfriend is adjusting, so it's a mutual effort. The fact that he's compliant suggests the author is within their rights to ask for accommodations. So the answer is B, No.\n"
