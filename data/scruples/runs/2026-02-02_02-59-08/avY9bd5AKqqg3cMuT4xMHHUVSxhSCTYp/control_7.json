I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is whether they're being unreasonable by asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop use and ASMR consumption when they're trying to sleep.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they need silence and darkness for their bedtime routine, which makes sense. They've moved in together, so adjusting to each other's habits is part of the process. The boyfriend's routine involves using his laptop, watching YouTube, or listening to ASMR, especially whispering or vocal ASMR. The author has misophonia triggered specifically by whispering, leading to anxiety and discomfort.\n\nThey do communicate their needs, asking him to turn down the sound, lower the brightness, etc. He doesn't seem to like it, but when shown a study about misophonia, he puts in earphones. That seems like a positive step. The author is clearly explaining their feelings and the impact of his actions, which is a reasonable approach.\n\nNow, the key points: Is it fair to ask someone to adjust their habits when it affects another person's well-being? The author isn't outright banning the ASMR; they're asking for adjustments that accommodate both their needs. The boyfriend's reaction suggests he might not fully understand the issue, but he complies once he's informed. \n\nMisophonia is a recognized condition, so the author's sensitivity isn't just personal preference. They're not being inconsiderate; they're seeking a compromise. The boyfriend's guiltiest pleasure is ASMR, but moving in together requires mutual adjustments. The author's actions are about their health and comfort, which should be prioritized. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the author isn't flexible enough. But they are making an effort to communicate and find solutions. The boyfriend's initial resistance might indicate a need for more discussion, but the author isn't at fault for standing up for their needs. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong). They're advocating for their health and making reasonable requests, especially after explaining their condition.\n"
