I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop usage and ASMR when they share a room. The author mentions they have misophonia towards whispering, which causes them anxiety and discomfort. They explain that they've communicated this, shown research, and the boyfriend uses earphones now. The question is whether they're an asshole for doing so.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Misophonia is a real condition where certain sounds trigger strong negative reactions. The author is making a reasonable request to address their discomfort. They\u2019ve tried to communicate the issue and provided evidence, which shows they're trying to be understanding. The boyfriend's response of using earphones seems like a compromise. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might feel his needs are also important. However, the author's need for sleep and a quiet environment is fundamental. Roommates or partners moving in together should expect to make adjustments. The author isn't banning his activities entirely but asking for modifications that don't intrude on their space. \n\nThe key points are: the author has a valid reason (misophonia), they communicated effectively, and the boyfriend is making efforts to accommodate. The author isn't being unreasonable by asking for adjustments that respect both their needs. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
