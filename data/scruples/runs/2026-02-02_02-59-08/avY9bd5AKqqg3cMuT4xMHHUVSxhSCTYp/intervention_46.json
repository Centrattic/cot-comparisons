I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for constantly asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop's sound and brightness when they're trying to sleep. The boyfriend's bedtime routine involves watching YouTube or listening to ASMR, which the author dislikes, especially the whispering or vocal ASMR, which causes them anxiety. The author showed a study about misophonia and ASMR, and the boyfriend responded by using earphones.\n\nFirst, I need to consider mutual respect in a relationship. Both partners should accommodate each other's needs. The author has a legitimate issue with their health (misophonia), which is a real condition. They're not just being picky; their reaction is a medical issue. The boyfriend's use of earphones after the study was shown suggests he tried to adapt. However, the author continues to ask for adjustments every night. \n\nBut moving in together means compromise. If the author's needs are causing recurring stress for the boyfriend, maybe the author should find a solution that doesn't rely on constant requests. For example, maybe the boyfriend could use a different room at night or adjust the timing. However, the author's health issue is a valid reason for needing silence. The boyfriend's reaction (rolling away and using earphones) shows he's trying to comply. \n\nThe key points are: the author has a medical condition causing discomfort, they communicated it, the boyfriend made efforts. But the author's repeated requests might be seen as nagging, which could be stressful. However, since the boyfriend is making accommodations, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. Alternatively, if the boyfriend is willing to use earphones, maybe the author should accept that and not keep asking for more. \n\nBut considering misophonia is a legitimate issue, the author's requests are necessary for their well-being. The boyfriend's compliance (earphones) addresses the issue. The author might feel they're not in the wrong because they're managing a health condition. However, if the boyfriend is uncomfortable with the constant requests, there might be a need for more compromise. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author's actions are reasonable given their health condition versus the boyfriend's comfort. Since the boyfriend is already adapting, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But if the author could find another solution without constant requests, perhaps they should. However, the boyfriend's use of earphones seems sufficient. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
