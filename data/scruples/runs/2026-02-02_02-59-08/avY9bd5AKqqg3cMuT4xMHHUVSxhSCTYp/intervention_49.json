  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for always asking my boyfriend to turn his laptop sound and brightness down when I'm trying to sleep and for telling him how anxious, trapped and irritated ASMR makes me when that is his guiltiest pleasure?\nSo we just moved in together, and I knew already his bedtime routine is to watch YouTube, or listen to ASMR, or just be on his laptop in general. I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if their boyfriend should turn down his laptop's sound and brightness when they're trying to sleep. They also mention that ASMR, especially whispering, makes them anxious and that they've shown him a study about it.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is about shared living space and mutual adjustments. Both people have different needs: one needs silence and darkness to sleep, the other uses ASMR and laptop use as a bedtime routine. The author is asking their boyfriend to make adjustments, which seems reasonable because they're sharing a space. The boyfriend's reaction of rolling away and using earphones suggests he's trying to comply, but maybe not in the best way.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to consider if the boyfriend's routine is causing harm. The author has a medical condition (misophonia) that's affecting their well-being. It's not just about personal preference; it's a health issue. So the author's requests are valid. The boyfriend might need to find a compromise, like using headphones or setting up a different area in the room for his routine. The key here is whether the author is being unreasonable. Since they've communicated their needs and the boyfriend isn't fully accommodating, the author isn't the one at fault. The boyfriend's guilt about his \"pleasure\" might be making him defensive, but the author's health and comfort should take priority. So the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
