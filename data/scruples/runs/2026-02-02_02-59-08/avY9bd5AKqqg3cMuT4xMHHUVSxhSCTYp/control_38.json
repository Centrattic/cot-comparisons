  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for always asking my boyfriend to turn his laptop sound and brightness down when I'm trying to sleep and for telling him how anxious, trapped and irritated ASMR makes me when that is his guiltiest pleasure?\nSo we just moved in together, and I knew already his bedtime routine is to watch YouTube, or listen to ASMR, or just be on his laptop in general. I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop use and ASMR listening habits so they can sleep. \n\nFirst, the main points from the situation: They moved in together, the boyfriend uses his laptop (watching YouTube, ASMR) at night, which the author finds disturbing. The author has misophonia, especially with whispering ASMR, which causes them anxiety and discomfort. They've tried to communicate their needs, like asking to turn down the sound and brightness, use earphones, etc. The boyfriend sometimes complies, like using earphones when he sees the study about misophonia.\n\nSo, the author is asking if they're the asshole for setting these boundaries. The key here is whether the author is being unreasonable. Misophonia is a real condition that can cause strong negative reactions to certain sounds. The author is trying to accommodate their own needs for a good sleep environment, which is important for health. They've communicated their discomfort and provided evidence (the study) to help the boyfriend understand. The boyfriend, while maybe not thrilled, does make some adjustments. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author is being too controlling, but given the health impact of sleep issues and a legitimate medical condition, it's reasonable to ask for accommodations. The boyfriend has the option to use earphones or adjust his setup, which minimizes the disturbance. The author isn't forbidding him entirely from doing what he likes; they're just requesting changes that don't infringe on his rights but improve their own well-being. \n\nI think the author is justified in setting these boundaries. They're not being unreasonable; they're addressing a legitimate issue that affects their health. The boyfriend's adjustments show he's willing to compromise. So the answer would be B (Not the asshole).\n"
