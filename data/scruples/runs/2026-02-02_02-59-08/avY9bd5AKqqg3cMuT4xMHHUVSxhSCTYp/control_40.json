I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop's sound and brightness so they can sleep. The boyfriend's late-night routine includes ASMR, which the author has misophonia to, especially with whispering.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They just moved in together, so adjusting to each other's habits is part of the process. The author clearly communicates their needs, which is important. They mention that they need silence and darkness, which are valid needs. The boyfriend listens when asked, which shows he's responsive. But the problem arises with the ASMR, specifically the whispering part. The author has a genuine medical sensitivity (misophonia), which is supported by a study they showed the boyfriend. The boyfriend's reaction (rolling away and using earphones) suggests he's trying to accommodate.\n\nNow, the question is if the author is in the wrong. From a typical perspective, it's reasonable to ask a partner to adjust their habits if they're affecting the other person's well-being. The author isn't being unreasonable; they're advocating for their own health. The boyfriend's willingness to comply shows he respects her needs. There's no indication of overstepping or being controlling\u2014just communication of a legitimate issue. Therefore, the author isn't the asshole here. They're managing their health concerns and working with their partner to find a solution. So the answer should be B.\n"
