I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his bedtime routine to accommodate their sensitivity to ASMR, especially the whispering kind. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and their boyfriend have moved in together. The boyfriend has a bedtime routine that involves using his laptop, watching videos, or listening to ASMR. The author, on the other hand, needs complete silence and darkness to sleep. They mention that they have misophonia, specifically to whispering, which makes them feel anxious and unsettled. The author has tried to communicate this to the boyfriend by asking him to lower the sound and brightness, and even showed him a study about misophonia and ASMR. The boyfriend then uses earphones and turns away.\n\nThe author is asking if they're the asshole for making these requests. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but is curious for another opinion. \n\nNow, to evaluate if the author is in the wrong, I need to consider both sides. From the author's perspective, they have a medical condition (misophonia) that causes them significant discomfort. They've communicated this to their partner and are asking for reasonable adjustments to their shared living space to ensure they can get enough sleep. In a shared living situation, mutual adjustments are often necessary. The boyfriend's actions\u2014using earphones and turning away\u2014suggest that he's making an effort to accommodate the author's needs, which is a positive sign.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might feel that his own bedtime routine is being disrupted or that his preferences are not respected. However, the author is not banning him from using his laptop or listening to ASMR; they're just asking for adjustments that don't interfere with the author's sleep. The boyfriend's response (using earphones) seems to be a reasonable compromise. \n\nMisophonia is a recognized condition where certain sounds trigger strong emotional and physiological responses. The author isn't just being picky; they have a legitimate reason for their discomfort. It's reasonable to expect a partner to make adjustments when it comes to shared spaces and routines, especially when the other person's health and well-being are affected. \n\nThe key points here are communication and compromise. The author has communicated their needs clearly and provided evidence (the study) to help the boyfriend understand. The boyfriend is making efforts to comply, which shows willingness to find a solution. \n\nHowever, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author is consistently making these requests and the boyfriend is complying, then the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. But if the boyfriend is feeling that his needs are being ignored or that the adjustments are unreasonable, that could be a point of contention. However, the boyfriend's own solution (using earphones) seems to resolve the issue without significant inconvenience. \n\nIn a healthy relationship, both partners should be able to express their needs and find a middle ground. The author isn't asking for the boyfriend to stop his routine entirely but to adjust the volume and brightness, which are minimal requests when living together. The boyfriend's adjustment (earphones) is a good example of mutual accommodation. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They have a valid reason for their requests, and the boyfriend is responding appropriately. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
