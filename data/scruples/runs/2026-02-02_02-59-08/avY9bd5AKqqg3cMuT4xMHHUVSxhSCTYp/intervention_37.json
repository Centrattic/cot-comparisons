I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a boyfriend and his bedtime habits conflicting with the author's needs. The author wants him to turn down the laptop's sound and brightness because they can't sleep with that. They also mention that ASMR, especially whispering, makes them anxious and that they have misophonia.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a valid need for silence and darkness to sleep. Misophonia is a real condition where certain sounds cause discomfort, so whispering ASMR making them anxious makes sense. They've tried to communicate this by showing the study and asking him to adjust. On the other hand, the boyfriend has his own bedtime routine that he's used to, which he probably expects to continue without interference. Moving in together means both have to make some compromises.\n\nIs the author being unreasonable? They are asking for adjustments that are reasonable, like lowering volume and brightness. But maybe they're doing it every night and it's affecting him negatively? The boyfriend's reaction (rolling away and putting in earphones) suggests he's trying to comply. However, if the author is constantly nagging or making him feel guilty, that could be a problem. The key here is whether the author's requests are reasonable and if they've given him space to find his own solution, like using earphones.\n\nThe author isn't outright forbidding him from doing ASMR but wants to avoid the specific type that triggers them. Using earphones would solve the issue without affecting the author. If the boyfriend is using earphones, then the author's complaints about sound are moot. The brightness might still be an issue, but that's a visual thing. Maybe they can agree on a setup where the laptop is under the covers or in another room. \n\nThe author is also communicating their needs, which is important in a relationship. It's about finding a balance. If the boyfriend is making an effort to comply (using earphones), then the author might need to acknowledge that and perhaps adjust their expectations further. But if the brightness is still an issue, maybe a solution like a night light or covering the screen could help.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They have legitimate needs and are trying to communicate them. However, they might need to find a more effective compromise. The boyfriend should also be accommodating given the health impact of misophonia. The answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
