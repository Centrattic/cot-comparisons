I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again. The author is living with their boyfriend, and their bedtime routines are conflicting. The boyfriend likes to watch YouTube, listen to ASMR, or use his laptop before bed. The author, on the other hand, needs silence and darkness for sleep. They ask him to lower the volume, reduce brightness, etc., which seems to bother him. The main issue is that the author has a strong adverse reaction to whispering ASMR, leading to anxiety and discomfort. They showed him a study about misophonia and ASMR, and he responded by putting in earphones.\n\nFirst, I should consider the key points here. The author is trying to maintain a sleep environment that's necessary for their health, which they have a valid reason for (misophonia). The boyfriend's habits are causing direct discomfort to the author. The author has communicated their needs and even provided scientific evidence, and the boyfriend's reaction was to avoid the situation by using earphones. That suggests that the boyfriend might not be considering the author's needs enough, especially if he's rolling away and using earphones as if to ignore the issue.\n\nBut wait, the author is asking if they're in the wrong for making these requests. The boyfriend's pleasure (ASMR) is conflicting with the author's need to sleep. In a shared living space, both partners have to make adjustments. However, if one's health is at stake, like with misophonia, that might take precedence. The author isn't asking for the boyfriend to stop entirely, just to adjust when the author is trying to sleep. It's about setting boundaries in a shared space.\n\nAnother angle is communication. The author mentions they've tried to let him do his routine but end up needing to ask repeatedly. Maybe the boyfriend isn't being accommodating enough, but the author is being specific about their triggers. The study they showed him might help him understand why it's important. If the boyfriend then uses earphones to avoid the issue, that could be seen as avoiding responsibility instead of finding a compromise.\n\nI think the key here is that the author has a legitimate health issue that affects their well-being, and they're making reasonable requests to maintain their sleep environment. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be to distance himself rather than collaborate on a solution. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for standing up for their needs, especially when they've communicated it clearly and provided evidence. The boyfriend might be the one not considering the author's needs adequately. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
