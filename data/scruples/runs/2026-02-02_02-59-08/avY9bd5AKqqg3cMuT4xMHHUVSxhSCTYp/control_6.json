I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop usage at night because it's affecting their sleep. The main points are about noise, brightness, and the specific issue with ASMR causing anxiety.\n\nFirst, they mention they moved in together, so shared living spaces mean adjusting to each other's habits. The boyfriend's bedtime routine involves watching YouTube or ASMR, which the author can't tolerate. The author has to ask him repeatedly to lower the volume, dim the screen, etc. They even have a specific issue with whispering ASMR due to what they call misophonia, which makes them anxious. They showed a study about this to the boyfriend, who then put on earphones.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key factors here are communication, mutual respect, and reasonable accommodations. The author is clearly communicating their needs and explaining the impact of the ASMR. They've tried to find a solution by showing the study, and the boyfriend complied by using earphones. This suggests the author isn't being unreasonable. However, the author is asking for ongoing adjustments each night, which could be a point of friction if the boyfriend feels it's too much. But given the health impact (anxiety, etc.), it's a valid concern. The boyfriend's reaction of rolling away and using earphones might indicate he's trying to accommodate. \n\nThe author isn't demanding a complete stop but adjustments. It's about cohabitation challenges where both need to adjust. Since the author isn't being inconsiderate of the boyfriend's preferences (he's allowed to watch as long as it's modified), it's more about managing shared space. The boyfriend's guilt about ASMR as his \"guilty pleasure\" might make him resistant, but the author's right to a good night's sleep is important. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
