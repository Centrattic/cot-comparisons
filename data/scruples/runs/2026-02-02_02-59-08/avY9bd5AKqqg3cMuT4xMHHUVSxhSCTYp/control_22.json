I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is the asshole for asking their boyfriend to turn down the laptop's sound and brightness when they're trying to sleep, especially because the boyfriend likes ASMR, which the author has issues with due to misophonia.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and their boyfriend just moved in together. The boyfriend's bedtime routine involves using his laptop for YouTube, ASMR, or just general use. The author, on the other hand, needs complete silence and darkness for sleep. The author has asked him to adjust the volume, brightness, etc., and the boyfriend doesn't seem happy about it. The main issue is the ASMR with whispering, which causes the author anxiety because of misophonia. They showed him a study about it, and he put in earphones.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong for setting these boundaries. Let's break it down. The author is asking for reasonable adjustments to their living space to accommodate their sleep needs. Misophonia is a real condition, so the reaction to ASMR is not just a personal preference but a genuine sensitivity. The boyfriend's actions are affecting the author's well-being. \n\nIn a shared living situation, both partners should consider each other's needs. The author is trying to communicate their needs, which is reasonable. The boyfriend might be frustrated because he's trying to relax in his own way, but the author's health and comfort are also important. The fact that the author provided a study shows they're trying to explain the problem objectively, which is a good step. The boyfriend's reaction (putting in earphones) after being shown the study suggests he's trying to accommodate once informed.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the author is being too demanding if the boyfriend is also trying to adjust. But since they just moved in together, it's part of establishing household norms. The author's requests are specific and clear, not unreasonable. They're not asking him to stop using the laptop entirely but to adjust volume and brightness, which are manageable. The ASMR issue is a specific trigger that the author can't control, so the boyfriend's adjustment is necessary.\n\nAlso, considering that moving in together requires compromise from both sides. The author is setting boundaries that are necessary for their health, which is valid. The boyfriend's pleasure in ASMR is a personal preference, but the author's well-being takes precedence in a shared space. Therefore, the author isn't the asshole here. They're advocating for their needs, which is necessary in a healthy relationship.\n"
