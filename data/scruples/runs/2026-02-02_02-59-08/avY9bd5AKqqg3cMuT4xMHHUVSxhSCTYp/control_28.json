I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is they moved in together with their boyfriend. The boyfriend uses his laptop at night, either watching YouTube, listening to ASMR, or just being on it. The author needs silence and darkness for sleep. They ask him to turn down the volume, brightness, etc., which he doesn't seem to like. The main issue is when he listens to whispering ASMR, which the author has misophonia for, causing anxiety and discomfort. They showed him a study about it, and he put earphones in.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is clearly communicating their needs, which is important in a relationship. They mention they have a specific sensitivity (misophonia) towards whispering, which is a valid condition. The boyfriend's bedtime routine is different, but moving in together means both need to adjust. \n\nDoes the author have the right to ask for adjustments? Since it's their home, they should be able to express their needs. The boyfriend's reaction (rolling away and using earphones) suggests he's trying to comply after being shown the study. The author isn't asking for complete abstinence from his habits; they're asking for adjustments when she's trying to sleep. \n\nThe key points are communication and mutual adjustment. The author isn't being unreasonable by setting boundaries for their health. The boyfriend might need to adapt his routine, especially since they live together. But the author is also respecting his habits by allowing him to do his routine as long as it's adjusted to not disturb her. \n\nI don't see the author being in the wrong here. They're advocating for their well-being and have provided evidence for their sensitivity. The boyfriend's guilt about his pleasure (ASMR) doesn't negate the author's right to a peaceful sleep environment. Relationships require compromise, and both sides need to find a middle ground. Since the author is trying to communicate and the boyfriend is making some adjustments, it seems like a fair situation. The answer is B.\n"
