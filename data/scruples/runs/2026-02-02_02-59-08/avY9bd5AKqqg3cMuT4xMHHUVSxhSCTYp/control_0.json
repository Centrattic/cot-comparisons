I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his bedtime routine to accommodate their sensitivity to ASMR, specifically whispering. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple has just moved in together, and the author has a bedtime routine that requires silence and darkness. The boyfriend uses his laptop, sometimes with ASMR, which the author finds distressing. The author mentions misophonia related to whispering, which is backed by a study they showed the boyfriend. The boyfriend's response is to put earphones in and roll away, but the author is questioning if they're being unreasonable.\n\nLooking at the key points: The author is clear about their needs from the start. They're not just making demands but explaining their medical condition (misophonia). They provided evidence, which shows they're trying to be understanding and communicative. The boyfriend's reaction is to use earphones, which is a reasonable compromise. The author is advocating for their health and comfort, which is important. However, the boyfriend's needs are also valid. The question is whether the author is overstepping.\n\nIn relationships, communication and mutual respect are crucial. The author is expressing their boundaries, which is necessary, especially when it's a health issue. The boyfriend's response suggests he's willing to comply, but the author is feeling guilty about it. It's possible the author is not in the wrong because they're prioritizing their well-being and communicating openly. However, it's also important that both partners feel their needs are met. If the boyfriend's ASMR time is significant, maybe they can find another time or place, but the author's request for a sleep-conducive environment is reasonable. \n\nSince the author has provided the boyfriend with information about their condition and he's made adjustments, it seems like the author isn't in the wrong. The key here is that the author is not being inconsiderate but is setting necessary boundaries for their mental health. So the answer is B.\n"
