I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop settings when she's trying to sleep. She mentions that he uses ASMR which she finds anxiety-inducing, and she has misophonia towards whispering.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. They just moved in together, so it's a new shared living space. She's setting boundaries for her comfort, which is important. Misophonia is a real condition, so her sensitivity to certain sounds is valid. She's not just being difficult; she has a legitimate reason for her discomfort.\n\nHe's using his own device, but the sounds and brightness affect her. Even if he's using earphones, the brightness of the screen could still be an issue. She's communicating her needs, which is healthy in a relationship. It's understandable that he might find the constant requests annoying, but her health and well-being are important.\n\nThe key points are mutual respect and communication. She's trying to coexist and has explained her reasons. The boyfriend's reaction (rolling away and using earphones) shows he's making an effort, but maybe not enough. The question is whether her asking for adjustments is unreasonable. Since she's in a shared space and has a legitimate issue, it's not about being wrong but about both working through it.\n\nSo, the answer is probably B, she's not in the wrong. She's advocating for her needs, which is essential in a relationship. The boyfriend should also be considerate of her needs as much as possible.\n"
