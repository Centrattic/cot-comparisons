I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop usage at night. The main points here are about their living situation and differing bedtime routines.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend uses his laptop for YouTube or ASMR, which he enjoys. The author needs silence and darkness to sleep. They mention moving in together, so this is a shared living space. The author has asked him to turn down the sound and brightness, which is reasonable because they're sharing a room. The boyfriend's actions are affecting her sleep, which is a basic need.\n\nThen there's the specific issue with ASMR. The author has misophonia related to whispering, which causes anxiety and discomfort. They showed him a study, and he responded by using earphones. That seems like a valid reason for the request. Misophonia is a real condition where certain sounds trigger negative reactions, so the author isn't being unreasonable here.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is to put in earphones, which is a solution that respects her needs. The author is communicating their needs and finding solutions, like adjusting volume and using earphones. It's about cohabitation and mutual respect. The key here is that the author isn't asking him to stop entirely but to modify his behavior in a way that doesn't disturb her. \n\nConsidering typical roommate or partner expectations, both should accommodate each other's needs. The author isn't being cruel or overstepping; they're managing a shared space. The boyfriend's guilt about his pleasure isn't the author's problem to fix\u2014his responsibility is to respect her boundaries. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). They're asserting their needs in a shared environment responsibly.\n"
