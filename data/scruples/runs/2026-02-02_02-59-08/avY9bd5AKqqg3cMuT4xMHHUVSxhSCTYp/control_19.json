I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they've moved in with their boyfriend, and there's a conflict over bedtime routines. The boyfriend likes to watch YouTube or listen to ASMR, especially whispering ASMR, but the author is really bothered by it. They mention that the boyfriend's laptop brightness and sound are disturbing their sleep, and they have to ask him to adjust it. The author also says they have misophonia triggered by whispering, which makes them feel anxious and uncomfortable. They showed a study to the boyfriend, who then put on earphones.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what misophonia is. It's a condition where certain sounds trigger a strong emotional response, like stress or anxiety. So if the author's condition is real and causing them distress, that's a valid reason to want to avoid those sounds. However, the boyfriend's habits are also part of his bedtime routine, which he might rely on for relaxation.\n\nNow, the author is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for telling their partner to adjust his routine. The key points here are communication and mutual respect. The author has communicated their discomfort, provided evidence of their condition (the study), and the boyfriend responded by using earphones. That suggests he's trying to accommodate her needs. However, maybe the author is being too strict or not considering the boyfriend's needs. But given that moving in together requires compromise, both sides should make adjustments.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction to the study\u2014putting on earphones\u2014is a positive step. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they're standing up for their health and well-being. But is there a point where they're being too demanding? If the boyfriend is making an effort, maybe the author isn't the asshole. Also, the author is trying to coexist by letting him use earphones or cover the brightness. It seems like a reasonable compromise.\n\nOn the other hand, if the boyfriend is genuinely using ASMR as a coping mechanism and the author is making it impossible for him to do that without some adjustments, maybe there's a balance needed. But since the author's condition is affecting their sleep and mental health, their needs are valid. In a healthy relationship, both partners should make adjustments for each other. Since the boyfriend is already changing his behavior (using earphones), the author isn't being unreasonable.\n"
