I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nThe author and their boyfriend just moved in together. The author has a bedtime routine that requires silence and darkness. The boyfriend, on the other hand, likes to watch YouTube or listen to ASMR before bed. The author asks him to lower the laptop's brightness and volume, which he doesn't seem to like. The problem is particularly with whispering ASMR, which the author is uncomfortable with, possibly due to misophonia. They even showed a study to him, and he responded by putting earphones in.\n\nSo, the main points here are about shared living space and mutual respect. The author is expressing their need for a certain environment to sleep, which is valid. They're not being unreasonable by asking for adjustments. However, the boyfriend's response might indicate he feels his preferences aren't being respected, hence the tension.\n\nMisophonia is a real condition, so the author's sensitivity to certain sounds isn't just being picky. It's causing them anxiety and discomfort. They've tried to communicate this, even providing evidence. The boyfriend's reaction of rolling away and using earphones could be seen as a way to avoid conflict rather than a refusal. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they're living together, both parties should accommodate each other's needs as much as possible. The author is asking for reasonable adjustments that don't interfere with the boyfriend's activities beyond volume and light. The boyfriend could use earphones and maybe a sleep mask or move the laptop to another room. The fact that the author has explained their medical issue (misophonia) and provided a study suggests they're trying to be understanding and reasonable.\n\nThe boyfriend's immediate reaction to avoid the situation might indicate he's not open to compromise or communication. The author isn't being unreasonable here; they're asserting their need for a good night's sleep, which is important for well-being. The boyfriend could also make some adjustments without too much trouble. Since the author is trying to find a middle ground and the boyfriend is not engaging in problem-solving, the fault might not lie with the author. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
