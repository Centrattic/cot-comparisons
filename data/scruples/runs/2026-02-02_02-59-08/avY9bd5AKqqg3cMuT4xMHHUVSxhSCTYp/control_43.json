I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop's sound and brightness when they're trying to sleep. The boyfriend's bedtime routine involves YouTube or ASMR, which the author finds uncomfortable, especially whispering ASMR because of misophonia.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple just moved in together, so there's a new living arrangement that requires compromise. The author has specific needs: silence and darkness for sleep, which are reasonable. They've tried to let the boyfriend do his thing but end up asking him to adjust, which he doesn't seem happy about. The author also mentioned showing him a study about misophonia and ASMR, which led the boyfriend to use earphones. \n\nNow, the key points: The author is communicating their discomfort and explaining their condition. They're not just being difficult; they have a medical reason. Misophonia is a real condition, and it's valid for someone to experience anxiety or irritation from certain sounds. The boyfriend's reaction (rolling away and using earphones) suggests he's trying to accommodate. However, the author is constantly making requests, which might be causing tension. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, it's about mutual respect and compromise. The author has legitimate needs, and they're trying to communicate them. The boyfriend, on the other hand, has his own bedtime preferences. The fact that the author is trying to find solutions (like earphones) shows they're willing to adjust. Maybe the boyfriend is also trying to compromise. However, if the author is always requiring adjustments without considering the boyfriend's needs, that could be an issue. But the situation seems more about a genuine conflict between two different needs, not one person being unreasonable. \n\nThe study mentioned adds credibility to the author's feelings. They're not just being sensitive; there's a psychological basis. The boyfriend's guilt about his \"guilty pleasure\" might be part of why he's reluctant to change, but the author's health and comfort are important. \n\nIn relationships, it's common for partners to adjust some habits for each other. The author isn't asking to stop entirely but to modify the volume, brightness, and maybe the type of content. The boyfriend's response suggests some adjustment is happening. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. They're advocating for their well-being while the boyfriend is also trying to maintain his routine. It's a balance, but the author's actions seem justified given their condition.\n"
