I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to lower his laptop sounds and brightness when they're trying to sleep. Also, the author mentions that the boyfriend listens to ASMR, which they find anxiety-inducing due to misophonia.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple just moved in together. The author needs silence and darkness for sleep, while the boyfriend has a different routine. The author is asking him to adjust his habits, which he doesn't seem happy about. The problem here is about conflicting needs in a shared living space.\n\nThe author has a medical condition (misophonia) that makes certain sounds, like whispering ASMR, very uncomfortable. They provided a study to explain this. The boyfriend's reaction was to roll away and use earphones. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for setting these boundaries.\n\nIn relationships, communication and compromise are key. The author is expressing their needs, which are legitimate, especially since misophonia is a recognized condition. On the other hand, the boyfriend has his own preferences. However, the author's needs are about their health and well-being, which is important. \n\nThe boyfriend using earphones suggests he's trying to accommodate her, but maybe not enough. The author is asking for reasonable adjustments, which should be expected in a living situation. It's not unreasonable to ask for a quiet environment when sleeping, especially when it's affecting mental health. \n\nSo, the author isn't being unreasonable here. They're addressing a valid issue that impacts their quality of life. The boyfriend might need to find a solution that works for both, like using earphones or a white noise machine. The author isn't the asshole here; they're standing up for their needs in a respectful way, especially after explaining the medical aspect.\n"
