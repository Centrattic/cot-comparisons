I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop's sound and brightness so they can sleep better. The boyfriend's bedtime routine includes watching YouTube or ASMR, which the author finds uncomfortable due to misophonia, especially with whispering ASMR.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has a valid reason: they need silence and darkness for their own sleep, and they have a medical condition (misophonia) that makes certain sounds, like whispering, distressing. They've communicated this to their boyfriend, who seems to comply (he puts earphones in after seeing the study). \n\nThe boyfriend's actions, while a personal preference, are causing discomfort to the author. It's about shared living spaces and mutual adjustments. The author isn't being unreasonable; they're setting boundaries for their well-being. The boyfriend's reaction (rolling away and using earphones) suggests he respects the request. \n\nIs there a balance here? Relationships require compromise. The author isn't asking for the boyfriend to stop entirely but to adjust the volume and brightness. They're not being inconsiderate because they let him engage in his routine, just with modifications. The boyfriend's pleasure (ASMR) isn't being taken away completely, just modified to accommodate the author's needs. \n\nPossible counterpoints might argue that the boyfriend has his own needs, but since they're in a relationship, both parties should make adjustments. The author's health and comfort are important. Also, the boyfriend's compliance shows he's willing to compromise. \n\nIn AITA posts, the community often looks at whether the person is being unreasonable. Here, the author seems justified. They've explained their needs and the boyfriend is making changes. The answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
