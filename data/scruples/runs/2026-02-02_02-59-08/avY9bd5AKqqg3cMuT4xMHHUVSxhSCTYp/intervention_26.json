I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author's boyfriend watching or listening to ASMR on his laptop at night, which is causing the author discomfort. The author has asked him to adjust the volume and brightness, and even showed him a study about their misophonia (specifically towards whispering ASMR). The boyfriend responded by putting in earphones. The author is wondering if they're being an asshole for setting these boundaries.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The key points are the living arrangement (they just moved in together) and the differing bedtime needs. The author requires silence and darkness, while the boyfriend has a different routine. The author has communicated their discomfort, which is valid, especially since they have a specific condition (misophonia) that makes whispering ASMR particularly annoying.\n\nMisophonia is a real condition that causes strong emotional or physiological responses to specific sounds. If the author has that, their reaction isn't just picky\u2014it's a health issue. The boyfriend's response of using earphones suggests he's trying to accommodate, which is a positive step. However, the author continues to ask for adjustments, which might be seen as persistent. But given the reason, it's more about respecting each other's needs.\n\nIn a relationship, especially when sharing a living space, both partners need to make compromises. The author is setting clear boundaries based on their health, which they have the right to do. The boyfriend's adjustment (earphones) is a reasonable compromise. The author isn't being inconsiderate here; they're advocating for their well-being. The boyfriend's initial resistance might come from not fully understanding the issue, but the author provided evidence (the study), which shows they're trying to educate him.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They're addressing their needs in a respectful way. The boyfriend's adjustment shows he's willing to meet halfway. The answer should be B (not in the wrong).\n"
