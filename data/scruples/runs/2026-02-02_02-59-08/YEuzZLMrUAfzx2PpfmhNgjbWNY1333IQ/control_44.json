Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for stopping their classmate from winning an award and making her cry. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author had a crush on Beck, who they thought was genuine and kind. They went through a lot to ask her out, and their family supported them. But then Beck's friend told them that Beck was using the relationship to boost her social media image and win an award for her college application. Beck was pretending to be kind to the author, who has facial scars and has been bullied, to get community service hours. \n\nThe author then found out about the award, checked online, and had friends and family as alibis. They somehow got the committee to withdraw Beck's nomination. Beck ended up crying, and the author feels no remorse, even though they're now more ostracized.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? From a moral standpoint, Beck's actions were definitely deceitful and manipulative. She used the author's feelings for her own gain, which is unethical and harmful. The author was a victim of this manipulation. However, the author's response was to actively sabotage Beck's award, which could be seen as taking revenge. Even if Beck deserved it, the author's actions might have crossed a line. \n\nBut wait, the author was hurt and found out through a friend that Beck was lying. The author took action based on that information. If Beck was indeed being dishonest and using someone for her own benefit, the author might have felt justified in exposing her. However, the method of stopping the nomination\u2014without going through proper channels or evidence\u2014might be questionable. Also, making Beck cry as a result of the nomination being withdrawn could be seen as an emotional consequence, but the author might not be responsible for that outcome directly.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's actions could be considered a form of retaliation. Even if Beck was in the wrong, the author's response could be seen as harmful. But considering the manipulation and emotional harm Beck caused, the author might feel justified. \n\nLegally, if the author used false information or defamed Beck, that could be an issue. But if they just provided the information they had to the committee, maybe not. Ethically, it's a gray area. The author was hurt and acted on personal feelings. The main question is whether the ends justify the means. \n\nIn conclusion, while Beck's actions were clearly wrong, the author's retaliation might have been a form of justice in their eyes, but it's still a matter of perspective. However, since the author took action that directly affected Beck's award, which is a public matter, it's possible they overstepped. But given Beck's manipulation, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong. The answer could be B (No), but I'm a bit conflicted. Alternatively, maybe A (Yes) because the author's method of stopping the nomination might not be appropriate. Need to weigh the harm done by both parties."
