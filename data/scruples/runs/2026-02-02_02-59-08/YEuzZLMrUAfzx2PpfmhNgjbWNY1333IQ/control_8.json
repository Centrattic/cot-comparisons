Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author stopped a classmate, Beck, from winning an award and made her cry because Beck was using them for social media posts to get an award. The author felt betrayed and decided to take action by finding out about the award and getting her nomination withdrawn.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author has a history of being bullied due to facial scars, which is really tough. They had a crush on Beck and went through a lot of effort to ask her out. Beck accepted, but then her friends started acting kindly for a short time, and the author found out that Beck was using them for her college application award. The author then took steps to have Beck's nomination removed, leading to Beck crying and the author becoming more ostracized.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. Intentionally sabotaging someone's nomination for an award is a serious action. Even if Beck was being manipulative, the author's response involved actively working against Beck's goals. While Beck's behavior was clearly exploitative and hurtful, the author's method of stopping her\u2014like contacting the committee\u2014might be seen as a form of revenge or retaliation. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, Beck's actions were deceitful and used the author's vulnerability to gain social capital. The author's feelings of being used and the resulting emotional distress are valid. However, the author's response involved interfering with Beck's opportunity, which could be considered unethical. The appropriate action might have been to confront Beck or report her behavior to someone in authority, but not to sabotage her award directly. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that their friend and family are acting as alibis, which might imply they had help in this scheme. While Beck's actions were harmful, the author's decision to retaliate in a way that affects Beck's academic prospects (like the award) might not be justified. Emotional harm is real, but the response should ideally seek justice rather than personal revenge. \n\nSo, even though Beck was in the wrong, the author's actions could be seen as crossing a line. The correct approach would involve addressing the manipulation through appropriate channels without directly undermining Beck's chances. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong for taking such a step.\n"
