Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for intentionally stopping their classmate from winning an award, which made the girl cry. Let me go through the details again.\n\nFirst, the author had a crush on this girl, Beck, for a long time. They went through a lot to ask her out, and she accepted. But then, they found out that Beck was using their relationship as part of a scheme to get a \"positive role model\" award for her college application. She and her friends were being kind to the author just for a short period to boost her image, planning to distance after March. The author felt betrayed, researched the award, confirmed her nomination, and then somehow got her nomination withdrawn, leading to her crying and the author becoming more ostracized but feeling satisfied.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author was in the wrong. Let's break it down. The key points here are deception by Beck, the author's emotional response, and the action taken to stop her award.\n\nBeck's actions were manipulative. She used the author's feelings for her own benefit, which is definitely unethical and harmful. The author discovered this deceit, which caused them emotional pain and a sense of betrayal. In response, the author took action to stop her nomination, which resulted in Beck losing the award and crying. The author has no remorse and feels satisfied.\n\nNow, the ethics of the situation. Beck's actions were clearly wrong, but does that justify the author's retaliation? The author's action here is a form of revenge. Even if the other person was in the wrong, intentionally sabotaging someone's opportunity, especially for an award, could be considered unethical. However, the author's motivation was based on being deceived and used, which adds context.\n\nBut legally and ethically, retaliating by interfering with someone's award process might not be justified. The author might have breached privacy or lied to the committee, which could be considered wrong. However, the emotional harm caused by Beck might make the author's actions seem more understandable. It's a complex situation where both parties acted wrongly in different ways.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author's action directly affected Beck's chances, which could be seen as crossing a line. Even if Beck was deceitful, the author's response was to sabotage her, which is not a fair or ethical solution. The appropriate action would have been to address the deception through proper channels or seek support, not to retaliate in a way that harms Beck's opportunities.\n\nSo, while Beck's actions are inexcusable, the author's response is also problematic. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for their retaliatory action, even if it was in response to being manipulated.\n"
