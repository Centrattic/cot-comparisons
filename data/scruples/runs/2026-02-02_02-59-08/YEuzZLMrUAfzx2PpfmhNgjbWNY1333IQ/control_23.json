Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about them stopping their classmate from winning an award, which made her cry. The author claims they did this because the classmate, Beck, was using them for social media posts to win a \"positive role model\" award. \n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author was in a relationship (or at least a crush) with Beck, who they thought was genuine but then found out she was using them. That's really hurtful. People can be manipulative, and if Beck was using their feelings for her own benefit, that's not okay. The author felt they were being toyed with, which is a valid emotion.\n\nBut then, the author decided to stop Beck from winning the award by having their name removed. That action led to Beck crying and the author getting more ostracized. The question is whether the author's retaliation is justified. \n\nLegally, if it's a public award, maybe the author's interference is unethical or against rules. But emotionally, the author was hurt and wanted to fight back. However, taking down someone else's nomination could be seen as a form of revenge, which might not be the right approach. The author's actions caused harm to Beck as well, even if they felt Beck deserved it. \n\nAlso, the author mentions they were bullied before, which might have contributed to their emotional state. But that doesn't necessarily justify retaliating. The key point here is whether causing harm to someone else, even if they wronged you, is the right course of action. \n\nIn terms of morality, it's a gray area. The author was wronged, but their response might not be the best way to handle it. There might be better ways to address betrayal, like talking to Beck directly or seeking help from authorities. Retaliating in a way that harms the other person could lead to more problems, like damaging their own reputation.\n\nSo, while Beck's actions were wrong, the author's response might still be considered in the wrong because they chose to retaliate in a harmful way. The answer would depend on the context of the award and whether the author had the right to interfere. But generally, taking such action without going through proper channels or addressing the issue constructively could make the author responsible in the eyes of others. \n\nTherefore, even though the author had reasons to be upset, their method of stopping Beck might not be the right approach, making them at least partially at fault.\n"
