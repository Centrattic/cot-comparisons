Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for stopping their classmate from winning an award. The situation is complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the author was deeply hurt by the girl named Beck. Beck had led them on, pretending to be kind and interested in a relationship, but in reality, she was using them to boost her own social media image and college applications. The author discovered this through a friend and felt betrayed. Then, they took action by contacting the award committee and causing Beck's nomination to be withdrawn. Beck is now upset and crying, but the author feels justified.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. The award in question is a \"positive role model\" award. If Beck was manipulating the author and using their feelings, that doesn't reflect genuine positive behavior. However, the author's method of stopping her\u2014contacting the committee directly\u2014might be problematic. They used their friend's and family's alibi, which could be seen as interfering with the award's integrity. Even if Beck was insincere, the author's actions might be considered unethical because they took matters into their own hands instead of letting the committee evaluate her actions.\n\nOn the other hand, Beck's behavior was clearly exploitative. She pretended to have a genuine relationship and used the author for personal gain, which is manipulative and cruel. The author, having been bullied and vulnerable, was further hurt by this emotional abuse. The award committee's job is to assess nominations, so if Beck's actions were part of her community service, the committee should have looked into it. The author's intervention might have exposed her manipulation, but that doesn't make the method right. The author could have reported Beck's behavior to the committee without directly interfering, allowing due process.\n\nThe author's motivations are understandable\u2014they were hurt and wanted justice. However, the means of retaliation (deliberately sabotaging Beck's nomination) is questionable. While Beck's actions were wrong, the author's actions could be seen as vigilantism. The key is whether the author overstepped by acting outside the proper channels. The emotional distress of both parties is valid, but the author's response might not be the appropriate way to address the situation.\n\nIn conclusion, while Beck's actions were unethical, the author's response was also wrong because they took direct action against her instead of letting the award committee handle the nomination. So, the answer is A.\n"
