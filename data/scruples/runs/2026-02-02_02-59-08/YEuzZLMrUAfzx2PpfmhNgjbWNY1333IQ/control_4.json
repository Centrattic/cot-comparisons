Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. First, the situation is that they had a crush on a girl named Beck, who they thought was genuinely kind to them. They went to a lot of effort to ask her out, and she accepted. But then, through a friend, the author found out that Beck was only being nice to them as part of a scheme to win an award. She was using the author's feelings to get community service hours for her college application.\n\nThe author then took action by contacting the authorities and causing her nomination to be withdrawn. Beck ended up crying, and the author now faces backlash but feels no remorse. The question is whether the author is wrong for doing this.\n\nHmm. On one hand, Beck manipulated the author's emotions for her own gain, which is clearly wrong. The author was genuinely hurt and felt used. But on the other hand, the author's response was to sabotage Beck's chances of winning an award, which could be seen as revenge and not the right way to handle the situation. The author didn't go through proper channels to report the manipulation, maybe? Instead, they took matters into their own hands, which might have been unethical or even a violation of rules.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that they are 17 and have been bullied, which adds context about their emotional state. However, that doesn't necessarily justify the action. Intentionally harming someone's opportunity, even if they were in the wrong, could be considered wrong because it's a form of retaliation rather than addressing the issue constructively.\n\nThe author's actions led to Beck crying and the author being ostracized, but maybe the right approach would have been to confront Beck first, or report the manipulation to the appropriate authorities in a legitimate way, rather than secretly withdrawing her nomination. So while Beck did something unethical, the author's response might not be justified either. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
