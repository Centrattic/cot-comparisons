Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for intentionally stopping their classmate from winning an award and making her cry.\n\nFirst, the author's actions: They discovered that their crush, Beck, was using them for social media posts to appear kind and win an award. The author then took steps to have her nomination withdrawn, which led to her crying and the author becoming more ostracized. \n\nNow, considering the context, the author had a history of being bullied because of their scars. They were genuinely hurt and felt betrayed when they found out Beck's true intentions. The author's actions were a direct response to being manipulated and used in a way that caused emotional pain.\n\nBut the key point here is whether the author's retaliation was justified. Even if the author was wronged, using their own actions to sabotage someone else's award, especially to the point of causing emotional distress, might be considered wrong. However, the author's perspective is shaped by a history of being bullied and feeling powerless. They might see their actions as a form of self-defense or standing up for themselves after being manipulated.\n\nOn the other hand, the methods used\u2014intentionally sabotaging the award and causing someone else to cry\u2014could be seen as harmful and possibly unethical. The author could have approached the situation differently, like confronting Beck directly or reporting the manipulation without taking matters into their own hands. \n\nThere's also the aspect of emotional harm. While Beck's actions were manipulative, the author's response caused her to cry and lose the award. Both parties experienced emotional distress, but the author's actions had more severe consequences.\n\nIn terms of moral judgment, many would argue that even if someone has been wronged, retaliating in a way that harms others is not acceptable. However, the author's background of bullying and trauma might influence their perception of fairness and self-worth. \n\nConsidering all these factors, it's a complex situation. The author was wronged and felt justified in their actions, but their response might still be considered wrong because of the harm caused. However, there's a strong argument that the author was acting out of pain and betrayal. \n\nBut according to typical ethical standards, causing harm to others as revenge, even if you've been harmed, is generally seen as the wrong choice. So, the answer might lean towards A, the author is in the wrong, but with empathy for their situation.\n"
