Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author had a crush on this girl called Beck. He went through a lot of effort to ask her out, and she accepted. They had a good time, but then he found out that Beck was using the relationship for her own college application by gaining a \"positive role model\" award. She had her friends pretend to be nice to him just for a few weeks and then planned to distance themselves. The author, feeling hurt and betrayed, decided to stop her from winning the award by getting her nomination withdrawn, which made her cry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of the author's actions. Beck manipulated the situation for her own benefit, which is clearly wrong. However, the author's response was to sabotage her chances at an award. Even if Beck's actions were deceitful, does the author have the right to retaliate in a way that causes her to be excluded or ostracized? \n\nThe author mentions he has facial scars and has been bullied, which adds context to his vulnerability. But the question is about whether his actions were wrong. Intentionally causing harm or humiliation to someone, even if they wronged you, can be seen as a breach of ethical conduct. The author's actions led to Beck being ostracized and crying, which could be considered harmful.\n\nHowever, Beck's manipulation was also unethical. She used the author's feelings to further her own goals. There's a case to be made that the author's actions were a form of self-defense or retaliation against a manipulative person. But even in cases of betrayal, the line between justice and revenge can be thin. The author's method of stopping Beck from winning the award\u2014without her knowledge\u2014might not be the right approach. Instead, reporting the manipulation to the award committee through proper channels could have been a more appropriate action.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on the author. He was already struggling with being ostracized and then went through emotional turmoil because of Beck's betrayal. His actions might stem from a place of pain and a desire for fairness. But does that justify his actions? If he took the nomination away without following the proper procedures, he could be seen as acting impulsively and causing more harm than good.\n\nIn many ethical frameworks, the principle of \"do no harm\" is important. Even if Beck was in the wrong, the author's response caused harm to her and possibly to his own relationships. There might be a better way to handle such a situation without resorting to sabotage. \n\nSo, considering all these points, even though Beck's actions were deceitful, the author's retaliation might be seen as wrong because it involved taking matters into his own hands and causing emotional distress to someone else. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
