Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for stopping their classmate from winning an award, making her cry. \n\nFirst, the author's situation: they've had a tough time with facial scars causing bullying. They developed a big crush on this girl, went through a lot to ask her out, and she accepted. But then he found out she was using him for her own benefit to win an award. She even made posts about him that were condescending. The author then took action to stop her from winning the award, which led to her crying and the author being ostracized.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author's actions were wrong. Manipulating someone's award nomination by interfering could be unethical. The author's actions might be considered a form of retaliation. But the author claims they were protecting themselves after being used. \n\nOn one hand, revenge might not be the right approach. The author didn't just let it go; they actively worked to remove her nomination. That's problematic because it's interfering with a fair process. But on the other hand, the girl used the author for her own gain, which is also wrong. \n\nThe author's motivation is key here. They felt betrayed and wanted to stop her from benefiting from a dishonest action. However, the method they used\u2014without going through proper channels\u2014might be wrong. Instead of reporting the manipulation to the right authorities, they took matters into their own hands. That could be seen as taking justice into their own hands, which isn't advisable. \n\nBut then, the girl's actions were exploitative. The author was a victim of emotional manipulation. The question is whether the ends justify the means. Even if the girl was in the wrong, the author's retaliation might have been excessive and could backfire. \n\nAlso, the author is now facing more ostracism, but they say they have no remorse. That might indicate they feel justified, but it's not necessarily right. The right thing might be to report the girl's manipulative behavior through proper channels and let the award committee handle it, rather than sabotaging her nomination.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions were likely in the wrong because they resorted to sabotage instead of addressing the issue through appropriate means. Even if the girl was manipulative, the author's retaliation is harmful and unethical. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
