Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author intentionally stopping a classmate (Beck) from winning an award by providing information that led to her nomination being withdrawn. The author was heartbroken after discovering that Beck had used him for social media clout and college applications. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions taken. The author found out Beck's plan through a friend, confirmed the nomination status, and then took steps to have the nomination withdrawn. The result was Beck crying and the author facing more ostracism but feeling no remorse.\n\nThe key points here are: the author's emotional response to being used, the method of stopping Beck (exposing her actions), and the consequences. The question is whether the author's actions were justified.\n\nOn one hand, Beck manipulated the author's feelings for her own benefit, which is unethical. The author's desire to retaliate could be seen as understandable given the betrayal. However, taking actions to actively sabotage someone else, even if they were wrong, might cross a line. The author didn't just expose Beck's actions publicly but ensured the nomination was withdrawn, which directly affected Beck's opportunity.\n\nEthically, while Beck's actions were deceitful, the author's response could be considered an act of revenge rather than a proportionate response. The author's actions were deliberate and caused harm (Beck's nomination being taken away and her crying), which might not be justified despite the betrayal. The author's own well-being and emotional state are important, but the method of handling the situation involved harming another person, which is typically seen as wrong.\n\nAdditionally, the author mentions that they are dealing with their own insecurities and past trauma. This context is important but doesn't excuse harmful actions toward another. The line between self-defense and retaliation is thin here. If the author had confronted Beck directly and asked her to stop, that might be different, but instead, they chose to undermine Beck's chances in a way that caused her distress.\n\nSo, considering all these points, even though Beck acted inconsiderately, the author's response of sabotaging the award is likely in the wrong. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
