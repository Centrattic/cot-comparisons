Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author stopped their classmate from winning an award by making her cry. The author has facial scars and was bullied, which adds some context about their background. They had a crush on Beck, who they felt was using them for social media clout to win an award. The author then took action to stop Beck's nomination, leading to Beck's award being withdrawn.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions of both parties. Beck, according to the author, pretended to be kind to the author to boost her own image. That's manipulative and definitely wrong. However, the author retaliated by interfering with Beck's award nomination, which involved checking the nomination list and possibly spreading information to get her name removed. The author also made Beck cry, which is emotional harm.\n\nThe author's actions are a form of revenge. Even though Beck was manipulative, the author's method of stopping her could be seen as unethical. Spreading information to have her nomination withdrawn might involve unethical tactics, and causing someone to cry intentionally is harmful. The author might feel justified because of their own history of being bullied and used, but taking matters into their own hands doesn't make it right.\n\nOn the other hand, Beck's actions were deceitful and exploitative. She used the author's feelings for her own gain, which is morally wrong. The author's retaliation might be a reaction to being victimized before. However, the correct approach would be to report the manipulation or seek help from authorities instead of taking revenge.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's actions were an appropriate response. While Beck's actions are bad, the author's response could be seen as crossing a line. Intentionally causing harm, even in retaliation, is generally not acceptable. The author might not be in the right because they chose to retaliate in a way that harmed Beck, rather than addressing the issue through proper channels.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they are now ostracized, but they have no remorse. This lack of remorse might indicate that they believe their actions were justified, but that doesn't necessarily make them right. The question is about whether they were in the wrong, not just their personal feelings.\n\nSo, considering both sides, Beck's manipulation is definitely wrong, but the author's retaliation by sabotaging the award and causing emotional distress is also wrong. The author's actions were a form of revenge, which is typically considered wrong regardless of the provocation. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
