Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for stopping their classmate from winning an award and making her cry. The situation is pretty complex, so I need to consider various angles.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that they were in a relationship with Beck, who they had a crush on. But then Beck's friend revealed that Beck was using the author for her own social media image and college applications. Beck had planned to distance herself after a certain date. The author felt betrayed and decided to take action by withdrawing Beck's award nomination. \n\nNow, the key points here are: 1) Did Beck's actions constitute manipulation or deceit? 2) Was the author's response justified? 3) What are the ethical implications?\n\nFrom Beck's side, if she pretended to be kind and friendly to someone for personal gain (an award), that's definitely unethical and manipulative. The author was genuinely trying to build a relationship, only to be used. That's pretty harsh, and it's understandable that they felt hurt and angry.\n\nHowever, the author's response\u2014intentionally sabotaging Beck's award\u2014raises concerns. Even if Beck was manipulative, the author took matters into their own hands by contacting the committee. This could be seen as revenge, which might not be the right approach. While Beck's actions were wrong, the author's method of retaliation might be problematic because it involved deception or interference with the award process. \n\nBut then again, the author was a victim of emotional manipulation. They might have felt that the system (the award committee) didn't know the truth, so they took it upon themselves to expose Beck. However, the proper course of action would be to report the situation through appropriate channels rather than directly withdrawing the nomination. The author's actions led to Beck crying and increased ostracism for themselves, which adds to the complexity.\n\nLegally, if Beck's actions were fraudulent in the award application, then the author might have a case to report it. But if the author fabricated information or used unethical means to get the nomination withdrawn, that could be their wrongdoing. The story doesn't specify whether the author provided evidence to the committee or just lied. If they did the latter, then it's definitely their fault. If they reported the truth, maybe the committee decided to withdraw it, which could be justified.\n\nBut the main issue here is ethical. Revenge isn't typically a good resolution. The author's actions caused harm to Beck, which might be disproportionate to the initial wrongdoing. Even if Beck was manipulative, making her cry and sabotaging her award might be an overreaction. The author could have addressed the emotional betrayal without resorting to undermining Beck's chances in a competition, which is a different realm.\n\nAlso, considering the author's background of being bullied and having a traumatic experience, their emotional state is more fragile. But that doesn't excuse unethical behavior. The balance between personal vendettas and appropriate action is tricky here.\n\nIn summary, Beck's actions were definitely wrong, but the author's response might be crossing a line. While they have valid reasons for feeling hurt, the method of retaliation could be seen as the author's fault. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong), but there's nuance. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they took direct action to stop Beck, even if Beck was at fault, the author's actions were likely unethical or inappropriate, making them at least partially wrong.\n"
