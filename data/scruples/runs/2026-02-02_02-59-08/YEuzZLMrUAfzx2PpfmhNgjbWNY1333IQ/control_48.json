Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author did the right thing by stopping their classmate from winning an award, leading her to cry. The author is 17, has faced bullying due to facial scars, had a crush on this girl, went through a lot to ask her out, and then found out she was using him for a social media image and college application. The author then took action to get her nomination withdrawn.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The girl, let's call her Beck, supposedly manipulated the author for her own benefit, using his feelings and her friends to create a false image of kindness. When the author discovered this, they took steps to have her nomination for the award withdrawn. \n\nThe key points here are consent, intent, and the consequences. Beck's actions were deceitful; she used the author's emotions for her own gain. The author's intention was to prevent her from receiving an award they believed was undeserved due to her manipulation. However, the method the author used\u2014intentionally sabotaging someone's award\u2014raises questions about their approach. \n\nIs it ever right to retaliate, even if you've been wronged? The author's actions led to Beck crying and the author facing more ostracism. While Beck's behavior was exploitative, the author's response involved actively undermining her, which could be seen as harmful. \n\nThe author might feel justified, but ethically, revenge or sabotage isn't typically considered a moral response, even in cases of betrayal. There might be better ways to address the situation, like confronting Beck directly or reporting the situation through proper channels if the award was based on false claims. \n\nAdditionally, the author's emotional state and past trauma (bullying, scars) might influence their decision-making. However, the outcome of their actions affected another person negatively. \n\nIn many ethical frameworks, causing harm to someone else, even if they've wronged you, is generally frowned upon. The principle of \"do no harm\" is important. Even if Beck's actions were wrong, the author's retaliation could be seen as perpetuating a cycle of harm. \n\nSo, while Beck's manipulation is inexcusable, the author's method of stopping her might not be the morally correct approach. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for not using a more constructive or less harmful method to address the situation.\n"
