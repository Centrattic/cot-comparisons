Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for stopping their classmate from winning an award and making her cry.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author had a crush on a girl named Beck. They went on a date, and Beck's friends were being nice to the author. Later, the author found out that Beck was only being kind to him to get a \"positive role model\" award for her college application. The author then took action to stop her from winning the award, leading to her crying.\n\nNow, the key points here are: Beck used the author's feelings to boost her own image. The author felt betrayed and decided to sabotage her. The question is whether this action was wrong.\n\nLegally, if the author contacted the committee and provided false information or interfered with the award process, that could be unethical or even illegal. However, the story says the author checked the nominations online and then informed the committee, possibly using their friend and family as alibis. If the information was truthful, maybe the committee had grounds to withdraw her nomination because she was using someone's emotions for personal gain.\n\nEthically, though, Beck's actions were manipulative. She led the author on a date and made friends act kind, all for her own benefit. That's definitely wrong. But the author's response was to retaliate, which might not be the right approach. While Beck was in the wrong, sabotaging her award could be seen as taking matters into her own hands, which isn't the best solution. The author could have reported the situation to a teacher or counselor instead of directly interfering.\n\nEmotionally, the author was hurt and felt used, which is understandable. But causing someone else to cry and being ostracized themselves might not be the healthiest way to handle the situation. The author's actions, while a reaction to betrayal, still caused harm. So, even if Beck was manipulative, the author's method of dealing with it is questionable.\n\nIn conclusion, while Beck's actions were definitely wrong, the author's retaliation might not be justified. The right approach would be to address the issue through proper channels rather than personal intervention. So, the author is in the wrong.\n"
