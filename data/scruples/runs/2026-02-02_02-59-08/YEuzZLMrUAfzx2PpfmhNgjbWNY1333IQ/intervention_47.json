Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is 17 and has a history of being bullied due to facial scars from an accident. They had a crush on a girl named Beck, went through a lot to ask her out, and felt happy when they started dating. However, Beck's friend revealed that Beck was using the relationship to boost her social media image and win a \"positive role model\" award for her college applications. The author found out that Beck's interactions were fake and that she planned to distance herself after March. In response, the author investigated and had the award withdrawn, leading to Beck crying and the author feeling ostracized but having no remorse.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, let's consider the author's actions. They intentionally stopped Beck from winning the award by contacting the committee. This led to Beck's nomination being withdrawn and her crying. The author did this after discovering that Beck had manipulated the situation for her own benefit, using his feelings to gain social media attention and community service hours. \n\nOn one hand, the author was deceived and used. Beck's actions were dishonest and exploitative, which is clearly wrong. The author felt hurt and betrayed, and their actions were a direct response to this manipulation. In that light, the author might feel justified in retaliating to expose Beck's deceit. However, the method they chose\u2014intentionally sabotaging Beck's award nomination\u2014could be seen as unethical or harmful.\n\nOn the other hand, retaliating by undermining someone's chances at an award, even if the person was being manipulative, might not be the right course of action. The author could have chosen to confront Beck directly, end the relationship, or report her actions to the appropriate authorities for a more formal resolution. Instead, they took matters into their own hands, which could be viewed as crossing a line. The fact that their actions caused Beck emotional distress (making her cry) and led to the author being ostracized further complicates the situation.\n\nThe author's emotional state is also a factor. They were deeply hurt and felt used, which might have clouded their judgment. However, taking revenge by sabotaging someone else's opportunities is generally considered wrong, regardless of the reasons. It's important to address the harm done to the author, but the method of retaliation could be seen as disproportionate or harmful.\n\nIn ethical terms, even if someone is wronged, the response should ideally be constructive and not involve further harm. The author's actions may have been a form of justice in their eyes, but they contributed to a cycle of hurt and retaliation. The school environment now has the author being ostracized, which adds to the negative consequences.\n\nSo, weighing both sides: Beck was clearly in the wrong by manipulating the author. The author, however, responded with an action that harmed Beck, even if it was to expose her deceit. The key question is whether the author's response was justified. While the emotional damage to the author is real, the act of sabotaging the award nomination could be seen as crossing a line, making the author at least partially responsible for escalating the conflict.\n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because their response involved intentionally causing harm to another person, even if that person had wronged them first. The appropriate course of action would have been to address the betrayal through communication or formal channels rather than personal retaliation.\n"
