Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complicated. The author had a crush on Beck, went through a lot to ask her out, and she accepted. But then they found out Beck was using the relationship for a social media image and a college award. The author then took action to stop her from winning that award, leading Beck to cry and the author being ostracized.\n\nFirst, Beck's actions seem unethical. She pretended to be kind and accepted the author's advances as part of a scheme to boost her own college applications. That's definitely manipulative and hurtful. The author discovered this betrayal, which is a valid reason to feel hurt and angry.\n\nHowever, the author's response was to actively sabotage Beck's award nomination. While Beck's actions were wrong, taking matters into one's own hands by contacting the committee and causing the nomination to be withdrawn raises questions. The author didn't go through proper channels or maybe even provide evidence of Beck's deceit. Instead, they directly intervened, which could be seen as unethical or even unethical if done without proof.\n\nThe author might argue that Beck's actions were malicious, but does that justify the author's retaliation? The line between standing up for oneself and taking revenge can be thin. The author's actions caused Beck emotional distress and affected the author's social standing. \n\nOn one hand, Beck's manipulation was wrong. On the other, the author's response might be considered a form of revenge rather than a justified action. The question is whether the author's actions can be justified as protecting themselves or if they overstepped by interfering with Beck's award.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the award. If Beck was nominated for being a positive role model but was actually manipulative, maybe the committee should have investigated. But the author's method of dealing with it could be seen as undermining a fair process. However, the system might have failed in verifying Beck's actions.\n\nIn conclusion, Beck's actions were definitely wrong, but the author's response might not be justified. Sabotaging someone's award, even if they're a manipulator, could be seen as crossing a line. So the author is likely in the wrong, but it's a nuanced situation. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
