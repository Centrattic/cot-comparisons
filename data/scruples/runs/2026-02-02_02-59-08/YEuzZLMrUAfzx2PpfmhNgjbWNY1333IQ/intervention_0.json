Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author, who has a history of being bullied and feeling ostracized, had a crush on a girl named Beck. He went through a lot to ask her out, and she accepted. But then he found out that Beck was using their relationship for a \"positive role model\" award, manipulating her friends to be nice to him temporarily and then distancing after March. The author then took action to stop her from winning the award, which led to her crying and him being ostracized more.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author discovered that Beck was using him for her own benefit, which is definitely wrong. But the question is, does that justify his actions? The author went to the authorities and used his network to have her nomination withdrawn. So he's taking a proactive step that directly affects Beck's chances of the award. \n\nOn one hand, Beck's actions were manipulative and deceitful. She led the author on with false intentions, which is hurtful. On the other hand, the author's retaliation involved exposing her and causing her to lose the award, which could be seen as taking justice into his own hands. This might be considered unethical because he's interfering in a way that's not through formal channels, maybe even leaking information or providing false information. \n\nAlso, the emotional impact on Beck is significant. She was crying, and the author's actions caused her distress. Even if she was manipulative, intentionally causing someone emotional harm can be wrong. However, the author felt betrayed and manipulated, which adds another layer. His actions were a response to being used, which might be understandable but not necessarily justified.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of revenge. The author's actions could be seen as an act of revenge, which is generally frowned upon because it doesn't resolve the issue constructively. However, given the context of his past trauma and being bullied, his feelings of being used might have driven him to act out of self-preservation or to regain control.\n\nBut legally and ethically, if the author provided accurate information to the committee, maybe it's different. However, if he fabricated information or used underhanded methods, that's definitely wrong. The story doesn't specify if he just reported what he found out or if he did something more manipulative. \n\nAlso, the consequences: the author is now more ostracized, but he doesn't feel remorse. That suggests he might believe he was right in his actions. But from a broader perspective, causing someone else to lose an award by personal intervention, even if they were manipulative, isn't typically condoned. It's a moral dilemma where both sides have valid points.\n\nIn conclusion, while Beck's actions were clearly unethical, the author's response may be considered the wrong move because he took it upon himself to sabotage her instead of addressing the issue through appropriate channels or seeking support. His actions caused direct harm, which is why most people might side against him. So, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong). However, there's a strong argument for his emotional state and the betrayal he experienced, but that doesn't excuse his actions.\n"
