Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the author stopped their classmate, Beck, from winning an award by getting her nomination withdrawn. Beck was using the author's feelings to boost her social media and community service for an award. The author found out and took action, leading Beck to cry and the author now facing backlash.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Manipulating someone's emotions for personal gain is definitely wrong. Beck used the author's feelings to improve her image and college applications, which is exploitative. The author felt betrayed and hurt, which is valid given the situation. However, the author's response was to sabotage Beck's award nomination. Even though Beck was in the wrong, the author's actions might be seen as unethical because they involved interfering in an official process. \n\nThe key points here are consent and the method used. Beck's actions were manipulative, but the author's retaliation involved deception or falsification to get the nomination removed. If the author lied or provided false information to the committee, that's a problem. However, if they used legitimate information, like the fabricated social media posts, maybe it's justified. But even then, exposing someone's actions through the proper channels might be the right approach instead of directly causing the withdrawal.\n\nAlso, the author's motivation matters. They were hurt and seeking justice for being used. But does that justify their actions? It's a gray area. While Beck's behavior was wrong, the author's method of addressing it might not be the appropriate way. The author could have reported Beck's manipulation through the proper channels, letting the committee decide, rather than taking matters into their own hands.\n\nAnother angle is the potential consequences. The author is now ostracized, but they feel no remorse. That suggests they believed their actions were justified. However, causing someone else to cry and face consequences could be seen as cruel, even if the target was in the wrong. It's about the balance between justice and revenge. The author might have crossed a line by retaliating in a way that publicly humiliated Beck or unfairly removed her nomination without due process.\n\nIn summary, while Beck's actions were definitely unethical, the author's response involved sabotage that could be seen as equally wrong. The right approach would have been to address the manipulation through proper channels, not personal retaliation. So, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
