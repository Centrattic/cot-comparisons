Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author had a crush on Beck and went through a lot to ask her out. They had a good time together, but then the author found out that Beck was using the relationship for her own benefit to win an award. The author then took action to stop Beck from getting the award, leading Beck to cry and the author being ostracized.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author feels they were manipulated because Beck pretended to be kind but actually had ulterior motives. Beck's actions were deceitful, using the author's feelings to boost her social media image and college application. The author then decided to report Beck to the award committee, causing the nomination to be withdrawn.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, Beck's behavior was unethical and hurtful, which the author discovered. The author's response was to take action against Beck, which might be seen as revenge or whistleblowing. The author might argue that they were protecting themselves from being exploited and exposing the truth. However, the method used involved going to the authorities and possibly sharing information that led to Beck losing the nomination. \n\nBut is it the author's place to intervene like that? If the award committee was aware of the nomination, maybe they should have been informed through proper channels. The author might have had a valid reason to report it if Beck was being dishonest in her nomination, but the author's personal vendetta could have been a factor. The emotional aspect here is strong\u2014Beck's actions hurt the author, leading to a strong reaction.\n\nHowever, the outcome was that Beck's nomination was withdrawn, which she found out through the committee. The author's actions led to this consequence, which might be seen as justified if Beck was indeed being dishonest. But acting on personal feelings without going through proper channels might be problematic. The author could have reported it anonymously or through a formal process instead of directly involving the committee. \n\nAlso, the impact on Beck is significant\u2014she's being ostracized and is crying. The author might feel justified, but the method could be questioned. The author's actions could be seen as vigilantism rather than a proper response. \n\nIn conclusion, while Beck's actions were clearly in the wrong, the author's response might not be justified because it was a personal retaliation rather than a formal or ethical approach. So the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, if the author was exposing a lie, maybe they aren't. But the way it was done might be the issue.\n"
