Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complex. So, the user is 17 and had a crush on this girl, Beck. They went through a lot of effort to ask her out, and things seemed great until a friend revealed that Beck was using the relationship for her own benefit, specifically to win a \"positive role model\" award. The user then took action to stop her from winning, which led to Beck crying and the user being ostracized.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Manipulating someone's feelings for personal gain is definitely wrong. Beck's actions were deceitful; she pretended to care to get an award. That's manipulative and selfish. The user was hurt and felt used, which is understandable. But the question is whether the user was wrong to retaliate by sabotaging Beck's award.\n\nThe user's actions involved checking the nomination list and getting others involved. While Beck's actions were unethical, the user's response might be seen as vigilantism. Did the user have the right to interfere with the award process? Probably not. The proper way would be to report the unethical behavior to the authorities through the correct channels, not to take matters into one's own hands.\n\nHowever, the emotional aspect is significant. The user had a history of bullying and low self-esteem due to their appearance. Being manipulated probably caused them a lot of pain. But even so, sabotaging someone else's award could have consequences beyond just the award. It's possible that Beck's actions were wrong, but the user's retaliation might not be the right solution.\n\nAnother angle: if the award committee had known about Beck's manipulation, they might have disqualified her anyway. The user's actions might have been a rushed response without giving the committee a chance to address it properly. This could be seen as a breach of trust and a form of revenge that's not justified.\n\nIn summary, while Beck's actions were definitely in the wrong, the user's response might be considered inappropriate because they took direct action to sabotage instead of reporting it through proper channels. The user's intent was to stop injustice, but the method was flawed. Therefore, the user might still be in the wrong for their actions, even if they were reacting to betrayal.\n"
