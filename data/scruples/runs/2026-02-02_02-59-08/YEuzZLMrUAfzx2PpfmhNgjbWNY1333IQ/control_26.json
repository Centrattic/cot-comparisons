Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for intentionally stopping their classmate from winning an award and making her cry. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the context. The author had a crush on Beck, who was using the author's affection to boost her college application by pretending to be kind. Beck's friends were instructed to be nice for a week and then distance themselves. The author found out through a mutual friend and then took action to have Beck's nomination withdrawn.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. On one hand, Beck was manipulative and used the author for her own gain, which is definitely unethical. The author felt hurt and betrayed, which is understandable. However, the author's response was to sabotage Beck's award, which led to Beck crying and the author facing more ostracism. \n\nThe key here is whether the ends justify the means. Even if Beck was in the wrong, does that make the author's actions justified? The author's actions were deceitful and possibly unethical. They used information they obtained to get the award revoked, which might involve lying or providing false information to the committee. That's a serious action with consequences for both parties.\n\nAlso, the author's motivation was revenge or retaliation, which isn't typically considered a valid justification. While Beck's actions were harmful, the author's response disrupted Beck's opportunity, even if it was deserved. The emotional impact on Beck is significant here\u2014she cried and her nomination was taken away, which affects her college applications.\n\nHowever, Beck's actions were manipulative and exploitative, which is a major issue. The author was in a vulnerable position, having been bullied and then used. The community's reaction (people talking behind the author's back) adds to the complexity.\n\nIn terms of ethics, even if someone is wronging you, retaliating in a harmful way isn't usually seen as right. The author's actions caused harm to Beck, which could be considered an unjustified response. So, while Beck's actions were wrong, the author's retaliation might still be considered wrong because it involved undermining someone else's legitimate goals.\n\nBut there's also a case to be made that the author was protecting themselves from further manipulation and seeking some form of justice. However, the method used was problematic. The line between justified self-defense and unethical retaliation is thin here.\n\nConsidering all factors, the author's actions were a form of revenge without due process. They didn't confront Beck directly or report the manipulation to authorities in a proper way. Instead, they took matters into their own hands, which could be seen as wrong.\n"
