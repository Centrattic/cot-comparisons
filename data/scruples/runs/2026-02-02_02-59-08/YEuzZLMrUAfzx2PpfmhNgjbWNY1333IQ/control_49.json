Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the person, let's call them AITA, had a big crush on a classmate named Beck. They went on a date, and Beck's friends started acting nice to AITA, but then Beck's friend revealed that Beck was using AITA for her own benefit to win an award. AITA then took action to stop Beck from winning that award, leading Beck to cry and AITA being ostracized.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Beck's actions were manipulative. She pretended to be kind and interested in AITA to gain points for an award. That's definitely wrong. But when AITA found out, they decided to sabotage Beck's nomination. Even though Beck's intentions were bad, does that justify AITA's actions?\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, sabotaging someone's award nomination by interfering is usually considered wrong. Even if the person being sabotaged did something unethical first, the act of retaliating in a harmful way isn't acceptable. AITA's actions caused Beck to lose the award and cry, which is emotional harm. AITA might feel justified because Beck used them, but revenge isn't typically seen as a valid solution. \n\nAlso, the impact on AITA's life: they're being ostracized now. But that's a consequence of their actions. Even if Beck was in the wrong, AITA's response was direct and harmful. The right approach would have been to confront Beck about the manipulation or seek support from authorities in a proper way, not to sabotage her award.\n\nAnother angle: Beck's actions were for a college application, which is a personal goal, but manipulating someone's emotions is still unethical. However, AITA's retaliation crosses a line. The author's motivation was hurt and betrayal, but using underhanded tactics to ruin Beck's chances isn't the solution. \n\nIn terms of social norms, people usually frown upon revenge plots because they escalate conflicts. Even if Beck was manipulative, AITA's actions might have been excessive. The fact that Beck's nomination was withdrawn because of AITA's interference means that AITA broke the process, which is a wrong action regardless of the reason.\n\nSo putting it all together: Beck was wrong for manipulating AITA, but AITA was wrong for retaliating in a harmful way. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
