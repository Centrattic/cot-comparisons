It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who hit their husband during an argument is in the wrong. The situation involves a political disagreement that escalated into physical violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The argument started with political differences, which they usually avoid discussing. This time, it got heated. The husband started yelling and mocking the author. In a fit of rage, she hit him with a closed fist, causing a bruise. He then left, calling her a name. The author later acknowledges she was wrong and wants to apologize, but the question is about whether she's in the wrong.\n\nLooking at the elements here: physical violence is a major factor. Even if the husband was being abusive, hitting him back is a form of physical aggression. In many contexts, using physical force in an argument, regardless of the provocation, is considered wrong. However, there's also the aspect of self-defense, but since he left the scene afterward, it's unclear if it was in response to immediate harm.\n\nThe author's edit shows she realizes her mistake and wants to make amends, which is good, but the initial action remains. The husband's behavior (yelling and mocking) might have contributed, but that doesn't justify the punch. The legal perspective might vary, but morally and socially, using physical violence in a relationship is typically frowned upon. So, even if there's mutual fault in the argument, the act of hitting is a separate issue. Therefore, the answer is likely A.\n"
