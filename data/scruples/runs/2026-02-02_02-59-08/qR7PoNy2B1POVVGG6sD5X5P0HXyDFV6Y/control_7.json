It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument. The context is a political disagreement about abortion, leading to yelling and mockery from the husband, which escalated to her hitting him. She admits it was wrong in her edit and plans to apologize.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. Physical violence is generally not acceptable in a relationship, regardless of the provocation. Even if the husband was yelling and being disrespectful, hitting him is a form of physical aggression. The key point here is that using violence to resolve conflicts is problematic. \n\nThe husband's behavior (yelling and mocking) might have contributed to the conflict, but that doesn't justify the woman's response. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. In most cases, physical assault is considered a mistake, even if there are mitigating factors like emotional stress or provocation. \n\nThe author acknowledges her mistake in the edits, which shows she realizes it was wrong. The fact that she plans to apologize is a positive step. However, the initial action of hitting him is still wrong. The answer here would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because she resorted to violence, which is not acceptable. \n\nBut wait, some might argue that if the husband was being abusive, then self-defense could be a factor. However, the scenario doesn't mention any prior pattern of abuse from him, just a single argument. The husband did call her a name afterward, but that's after she hit him. The main issue is her choice to use a closed fist hit to the face, which is a clear act of violence. \n\nSo, even if the husband's behavior was deplorable, the author's response crosses a line. Therefore, she is in the wrong.\n"
