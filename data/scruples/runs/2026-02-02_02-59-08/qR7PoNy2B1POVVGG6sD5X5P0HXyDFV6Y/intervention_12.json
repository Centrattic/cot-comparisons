It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's read through the situation again.\n\nThe author is a married person and got into a political argument with their husband. They mention they usually ignore their differences, but this time it escalated. The husband started yelling and mocking her, and in a fit of rage, she hit him in the face with a closed fist. Then he ran off, and when she saw him later, he had a small bruise. He called her a \"bitch\" and drove off. She hasn't seen him since and is asking if she's the asshole for punching him or if he's being a baby.\n\nFirst, the key issue here is physical violence in a relationship. Even if the husband was being aggressive and yelling, using a closed fist to hit someone's face is a form of assault. In most places, hitting your partner is considered domestic violence, which is a criminal act. So from a legal standpoint, the author is likely in the wrong. \n\nThen there's the moral aspect. Arguments can get heated, but resorting to physical violence is not acceptable. The fact that she admits it was her first time and plans to apologize is important, but that doesn't make the action right. Hitting someone is never a justified response, regardless of the provocation. The husband's response of calling her a \"bitch\" and driving off is also inappropriate, but that doesn't excuse her using violence.\n\nThe author's edits show she's aware of the possible backlash and is trying to clarify that it was a one-time thing. However, the initial action is still a problem. Even if the husband was being an asshole, the author's choice to hit him crosses a significant line. The title \"AITA for hitting my husband?\" already acknowledges she's questioning her own behavior, which leans towards her recognizing it's likely wrong.\n\nSo, combining legal and moral perspectives, the author is in the wrong here. The husband's behavior was also bad, but physical violence is a serious issue and shouldn't be used as a response to an argument, no matter how intense.\n"
