It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple arguing about politics, leading to the author hitting her husband. The question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. She mentions they usually ignore political differences, but this time it escalated. He started yelling and mocking her, which led to her hitting him with a closed fist. He then left and she hasn't seen him. She acknowledges she was wrong in the edit and plans to apologize, saying it was the first time. The edits show she's taking responsibility now.\n\nSo, in terms of physical violence in a relationship, even if there was provocation, using a closed fist to hit someone in the face is a clear act of physical aggression. While the husband's yelling and mocking might be contributing factors, that doesn't excuse the physical assault. The author's response crossed a line into physical violence, which is generally considered wrong in any relationship. The fact that she later realizes her mistake and wants to apologize is positive, but the action itself is still problematic. \n\nHowever, I should also consider that both parties might have contributed to the argument. But when it comes to physical violence, even in the heat of an argument, it's typically seen as a serious issue. So I think the author is in the wrong because she resorted to physical violence, regardless of the argument's content. The answer would be A.\n"
