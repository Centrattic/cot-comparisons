It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument. The situation involves political differences leading to a heated argument where the husband yells and mocks her, resulting in her punching him. She later realizes her mistake and plans to apologize.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the use of physical violence. Even if there was provocation, hitting someone in a relationship is a form of domestic violence. The fact that he called her a \"bitch\" after she hit him doesn't excuse her actions. While arguments can get intense, resorting to physical aggression is a problem because it can escalate conflicts and cause harm. The author acknowledges her mistake in an edit, which is a positive step, but the initial action of hitting is clearly wrong. The husband's yelling and mocking might have contributed, but that doesn't justify a physical response. The answer should consider both parties' actions but focus on the fact that using a closed fist to hit someone's face is not acceptable. So, the author is in the wrong.\n"
