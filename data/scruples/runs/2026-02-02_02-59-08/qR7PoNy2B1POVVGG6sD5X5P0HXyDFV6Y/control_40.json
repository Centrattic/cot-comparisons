It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for hitting their husband. So the situation is that they had an argument about politics, leading to yelling and mocking. The wife hit him with a closed fist, causing a small bruise. Then he left, and she's wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legality and morality. Hitting someone is considered assault in many places, regardless of the reason. Even if provoked, using physical violence is generally not acceptable. The fact that it's a spouse doesn't change the fact that assault is wrong. The husband's yelling and mocking could be part of the context, but it doesn't justify the physical response.\n\nThe author made an edit saying they realized they were wrong and plan to apologize, which shows some self-awareness. However, the act itself is still a problem. The husband's behavior (yelling, mocking) is also not good, but that doesn't make the wife's punch okay. The key point is that violence in a relationship is a serious issue, even if both parties have contributed to tension.\n\nThe answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because using physical violence is not acceptable, even in the heat of an argument. It's important to address conflicts without resorting to hitting, and there are better ways to handle disagreements. The author's acknowledgment of her mistake shows she knows this, but the action itself is still wrong.\n"
