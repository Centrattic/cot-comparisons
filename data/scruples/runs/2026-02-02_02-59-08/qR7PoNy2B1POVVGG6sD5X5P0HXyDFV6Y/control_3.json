It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument. The situation involves political differences leading to an argument, with the husband yelling and mocking her, which led her to punch him. Now, she's wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. Physical violence in a relationship is a red flag, regardless of the provocation. Even if the husband was being disrespectful by yelling and mocking, hitting someone is not an acceptable response. The author admits she hit him with a closed fist, causing a bruise. That's assault, even between spouses. \n\nThe husband then left, and she hasn't seen him since. The initial argument's context (political differences) is probably less relevant than the actual physical altercation. The edit where she says she realizes it was wrong and plans to apologize shows some accountability, but the action itself is still problematic. \n\nThe other edits mention a troll account and some random comment, but those might be distractions. The main issue is the physical violence. So, even if the husband provoked her with words, using force is not justified. Therefore, the author is in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
