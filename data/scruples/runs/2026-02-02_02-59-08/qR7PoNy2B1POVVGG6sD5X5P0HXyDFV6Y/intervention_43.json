It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple with political differences that led to an argument. The husband was yelling and mocking her, and she hit him with a closed fist, causing a bruise. He left afterward, and she's now considering if she was the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether using physical violence in this context is justified. Even if the husband was yelling and being disrespectful, hitting him is a form of assault. Physical aggression is not acceptable regardless of the provocation. The fact that this is the first time she's done this might mitigate some of the blame, but it doesn't excuse the action. \n\nShe also mentions in her edit that she realizes her mistake and plans to apologize. This shows reflection, but the act itself is still wrong. The husband's behavior (yelling and mocking) was inappropriate too, but that doesn't make her response okay. The key point here is that violence in a relationship is never the right solution. \n\nThe troll edit and the \"GAMERS RISE UP\" part might be distractions, but the core issue remains. The author's physical aggression is the main problem. So the answer should be A\u2014she is in the wrong.\n"
