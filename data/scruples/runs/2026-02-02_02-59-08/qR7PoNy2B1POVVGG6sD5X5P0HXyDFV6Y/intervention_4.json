It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument. The situation starts with a political disagreement about abortion, which escalates into yelling and mockery. The author then hits her husband, which causes a bruise. After that, he leaves, and she hasn't seen him since.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. Physical violence in a relationship is a big issue. Even if there was prior provocation, like yelling or insults, using physical force is generally considered wrong. The author admits she acted in a fit of rage, which might be a mitigating factor, but it doesn't excuse the action. The husband's response\u2014calling her a name and driving off\u2014could be seen as his reaction to being hit, which is expected after such an incident.\n\nThe user already thinks the author is in the wrong, and the author herself in the edit admits she was wrong and plans to apologize. This self-awareness is important. However, the initial act of hitting is a clear violation of non-violence in a relationship. Even if the argument was intense, crossing into physical aggression sets a dangerous precedent. \n\nThere's also the context of their usual political disagreements being ignored, meaning this wasn't a routine issue but a significant escalation. The husband's mocking and yelling might have contributed, but that doesn't justify the physical response. Relationships require communication and conflict resolution without violence. The author's action could be seen as a breakdown in that communication, leading to serious consequences.\n\nAdditionally, the author's edit about realizing her mistake and wanting to make up is a good sign, but it's important to note that apologizing after the fact doesn't erase the harm done. The husband's absence now might mean he's processing the situation or is hurt. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer seems to be that the author is in the wrong. Physical aggression is a serious issue regardless of the circumstances. Even in heated arguments, it's crucial to avoid physical harm. So the answer would be A.\n"
