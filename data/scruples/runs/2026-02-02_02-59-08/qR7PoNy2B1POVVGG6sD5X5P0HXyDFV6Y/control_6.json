It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the couple had a political argument about abortion, which escalated. The husband started yelling and mocking her, leading her to hit him with a closed fist. He ended up with a small bruise, then left in his car. She hasn't seen him since and is asking if she's the asshole.\n\nLooking at the details, physical violence in a relationship is generally considered wrong. Even if there was provocation like yelling and mocking, hitting someone is a form of assault. The fact that she admits she's sorry and plans to apologize is a good sign, but that doesn't negate the action itself. \n\nIn most contexts, using physical force to resolve an argument isn't acceptable. Both parties might have contributed to the escalation, but the act of hitting crosses a line. The husband's behavior (yelling, mocking, calling her a name) is also problematic, but that doesn't justify her response. \n\nThe edits show she's acknowledging her mistake, which is important, but the question is whether she was wrong. The answer is likely yes. Even if the husband was being an asshole, hitting him isn't the right response. So the answer should be A.\n"
