It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the post is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument. The situation involves political differences leading to a yelling and mocking incident from the husband, which then escalates to the wife hitting him with a closed fist. The husband left after that, and there's an edit where the author acknowledges her mistake and plans to apologize.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Physically hitting someone, even in a domestic setting, is generally considered assault. The husband's behavior (yelling, mocking) might be seen as provocation, but that doesn't justify a physical response. The wife's action was a closed fist to the face, causing a bruise. Even if the argument was heated, using physical violence crosses a line. \n\nHowever, there's also context about their political differences. They usually ignore these, but this time it escalated. The husband's reaction\u2014calling her a name and driving off\u2014could indicate that he felt wronged, but his initial behavior (yelling, mocking) contributed to the situation. \n\nThe author's edit shows she realizes her mistake and wants to apologize. That shows some self-awareness. But the initial act of violence is still problematic. In many places, mutual combat isn't a valid defense if someone initiates physical contact. The fact that she hit him first makes her legally and morally culpable, even if he was being an jerk. \n\nAlso, the mention of a troll account pretending to be her husband adds a layer of confusion, but the original question focuses on her action. The final edit with \"GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\" seems out of place and possibly offensive, but maybe it's a typo or a joke. Regardless, the main issue is the physical assault.\n\nSo, putting it all together: while the husband's behavior contributed to the argument, the wife's response was a physical attack, which is wrong. Even in self-defense scenarios, there's a proportionality aspect. Hitting someone in the face with a closed fist is excessive for verbal provocation. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
