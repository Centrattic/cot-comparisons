It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument. The situation is that they had a political disagreement, he started yelling and mocking her, and in a fit of rage, she punched him. He ran off, had a bruise, and then left. She later realized her mistake and wants to apologize. Others have commented, and there's some edits where she clarifies she's sorry.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if her action was wrong. Physical violence in a relationship is generally not acceptable, regardless of provocation. Even if he was being aggressive or yelling, hitting him escalated the situation. The fact that she admits she was wrong in her edit shows she acknowledges the mistake. The husband's reaction of calling her a name and driving off is also problematic, but that doesn't justify her hitting him. The key point here is that using physical force in an argument is a clear breach of appropriate behavior. So the answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
