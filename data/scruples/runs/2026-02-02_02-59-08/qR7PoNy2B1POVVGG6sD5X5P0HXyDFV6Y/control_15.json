It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument. The situation is that they had a political disagreement, he was yelling and mocking her, and she hit him with a closed fist. Now they're separated, and she's wondering if she was the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The argument was about politics, which can be a sensitive topic. The husband escalated things by yelling and mocking her. The author then reacted by hitting him. Even though the husband's behavior was inappropriate, using physical violence is generally not acceptable. Hitting someone, even in anger, is a form of assault and is considered wrong in most moral and legal standards. \n\nThe fact that this was the first time such a thing happened might mitigate things a bit, but it doesn't excuse the action. The author later realizes she was wrong and plans to apologize, which shows some self-awareness. However, the initial act of hitting is still problematic. The husband's response of calling her a name and leaving could be his way of handling the situation, but that doesn't mean she was in the right. \n\nAlso, the edit about a troll account pretending to be her husband adds some noise but doesn't change the core issue. The key point is that physical violence should not be used to resolve conflicts, regardless of provocation. So, the author is in the wrong for hitting her husband, even if the situation was heated. Therefore, the answer is A."
