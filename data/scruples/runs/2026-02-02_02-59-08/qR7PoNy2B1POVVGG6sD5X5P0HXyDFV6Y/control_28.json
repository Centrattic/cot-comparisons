It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument. The situation is a political disagreement that escalated. The husband was yelling and mocking her, and in a rage, she hit him with a closed fist, causing a small bruise. Then he left, and she hasn't seen him since. She's asking if she's the asshole (ITA) for punching him or if he's overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They usually ignore their political differences, but this argument was big. The husband started yelling and mocking her, which led to her hitting him. Even though there was provocation, using physical violence is generally not acceptable. Hitting someone, even in anger, is a form of assault, regardless of the reason. The fact that it was a closed fist to the face is significant because it's intentional and can cause harm. The woman acknowledges she was wrong in her edit, so she's taking responsibility, which is a good sign.\n\nHowever, the husband's response of calling her a \"bitch\" and driving off might be seen as his own escalation. But that doesn't justify her hitting him. Both sides might have acted in ways that contributed to the conflict, but physical violence is a more severe action. In most societies, there's a strong emphasis on resolving conflicts without violence. Even if he was being insulting, hitting him crosses a line. The woman's admission that she'll apologize shows she recognizes the mistake, but the act itself is still wrong. The answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong. The husband's mocking and yelling are not a justification for physical assault. So, the answer should be A.\n"
