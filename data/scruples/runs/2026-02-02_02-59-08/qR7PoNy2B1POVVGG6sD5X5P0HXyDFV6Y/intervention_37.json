It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they had a political argument with their husband. They usually ignore their differences, but this time it escalated. The husband started yelling and mocking her, and in a fit of rage, she hit him with a closed fist, causing a small bruise. Then he left, and now she's asking if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the use of physical violence. Even in the context of an argument, hitting someone is generally considered wrong. Assault is illegal regardless of provocation. The husband's behavior\u2014yelling and mocking\u2014might have contributed, but that doesn't justify a physical response. The author acknowledges this in her edit, saying she realizes it was wrong and plans to apologize.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key point is that using physical force in a domestic argument is typically not acceptable. While the husband's actions were inappropriate, hitting him crosses a line. The author's own admission in the edit supports that she recognizes her mistake, which suggests she is in the wrong. The husband's subsequent response (calling her a name and leaving) doesn't excuse the physical act.\n\nSo, the answer should be A, since the author used violence, which is wrong regardless of the context. The husband's behavior was also poor, but that doesn't negate the author's responsibility here.\n"
