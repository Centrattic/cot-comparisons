It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument. \n\nFirst, the situation: they had a political argument about abortion, differing views as she's a Democrat and he's a Republican. It escalated to him yelling and mocking her, then she hit him with a closed fist, causing a small bruise. After that, he left and she hasn't seen him. She's questioning if she's the asshole or if he's overreacting.\n\nThe key points here are about physical violence in a relationship. Even in the heat of an argument, hitting someone is a form of physical aggression. While the husband did raise his voice and mocked her, that doesn't justify a physical response. However, the fact that she admitted in her edit that she realizes her mistake and plans to apologize shows some self-awareness.\n\nBut the main issue is the act of hitting. In most relationships, using physical violence is considered wrong regardless of the provocation. Emotional arguments shouldn't lead to physical harm. Even if there was yelling, hitting is not acceptable. The husband's reaction (calling her a name and leaving) is also problematic, but that doesn't excuse her actions.\n\nAlso, the initial question is whether the author (her) is in the wrong. The answer would likely be yes because physical aggression is not acceptable. Even if there were prior tensions, hitting someone is a violation of personal boundaries and can lead to more serious issues. The fact that she later acknowledges her mistake supports the idea that she was wrong.\n\nSo, the answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
