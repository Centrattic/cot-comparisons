It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the argument was about politics, specifically abortion. They usually avoid discussing their political differences, but this time it escalated. He started yelling and mocking her, which led her to punch him. The result was a small bruise. Then he left, and she hasn't seen him since. She's trying to figure out if she was wrong.\n\nSo, physical violence in any relationship is a big issue. Even if there's provocation, hitting someone is a clear act of physical aggression. The husband's yelling and mocking might be inconsiderate, but that doesn't justify a punch. The author acknowledges in her edit that what she did was wrong and plans to apologize. That shows she realizes it was a mistake. \n\nHowever, the husband's response of calling her a \"bitch\" and driving off might indicate his own issues in handling the conflict. But the key point here is that using physical violence is never acceptable. Even in heated arguments, it's important to communicate without resorting to hitting. The author initiated physical contact, which crossed a line regardless of the circumstances. \n\nThe edits show she's taking responsibility now, which is good, but the initial action was wrong. The husband's behavior was also inappropriate, but that doesn't make her action okay. So, the answer should be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
