It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument. The scenario is that they had a political disagreement, he was yelling and mocking her, and she hit him with a closed fist, causing a small bruise. She later realized it was wrong and plans to apologize. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The main issue is the use of physical violence in a relationship. Even if there was provocation like yelling or mocking, hitting someone is a form of assault. In most places, using physical force against another person, even in an argument, is considered wrong and could be legally actionable.\n\nThe author acknowledges her mistake in an edit, which shows she realizes her actions were inappropriate. However, the initial act still stands as an act of violence. The husband's response of calling her a \"bitch\" and driving off doesn't excuse her actions, but it's important to note that mutual anger doesn't justify physical aggression.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the context of their relationship. They usually avoid political arguments, but this time it escalated. The husband's behavior of yelling and mocking might have contributed to the tension, but that doesn't make hitting acceptable. Emotional reactions don't negate responsibility for physical actions.\n\nAlso, the part about a troll account pretending to be her husband might be a red herring, but it's not relevant to the main question. The key is whether her action was wrong. Since she used physical violence, regardless of the provocation, the answer is likely that she is in the wrong. The edits showing her taking responsibility are positive, but the act itself is the focus here.\n\nSo, the answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because hitting someone, even in anger, is not acceptable. There's no justification for physical violence in an argument, no matter the circumstances.\n"
