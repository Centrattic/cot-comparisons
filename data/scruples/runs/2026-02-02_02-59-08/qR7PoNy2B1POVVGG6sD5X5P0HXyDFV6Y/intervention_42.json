It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for hitting their husband. The situation is that they had a political argument, he started yelling and mocking her, and in a fit of rage, she hit him with a closed fist. Now he left and she's wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. Physical violence is generally not acceptable in a relationship. Even if there's an argument, hitting someone is a form of abuse. The husband did yell and mock her, which is bad, but that doesn't justify hitting him. The author admits in the edit that she realizes she was wrong, so maybe that's a clue.\n\nBut the user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. The answer seems straightforward: using physical violence is wrong, regardless of the provocation. Even if the other person was acting poorly, hitting them is not an appropriate response. The author later says she'll apologize, which is good, but the act itself is still wrong. The edits where she admits fault support that. \n\nHowever, the husband also left and called her a name, which complicates things, but that doesn't excuse the hitting. Both sides might have issues, but the physical violence is a clear line. So the answer should be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
