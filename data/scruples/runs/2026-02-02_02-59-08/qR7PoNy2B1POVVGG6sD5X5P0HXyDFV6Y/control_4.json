It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that she and her husband had a political argument, he started yelling and mocking her, and in a fit of rage, she hit him with a closed fist. He left, and now she's wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. Physical violence in a relationship is a big issue. Even if there was provocation, using physical force is generally considered wrong. She admits she hit him, which is an act of assault. He was yelling and mocking her, which is disrespectful and could escalate tension, but that doesn't justify her hitting him. She later realizes she was wrong and wants to apologize, which shows she's taking responsibility. However, the initial action is still a problem. The husband calling her a \"bitch\" might be part of the conflict, but it doesn't make her actions okay.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, most societal standards and legal systems consider physical violence as a wrong action regardless of the circumstances. So the author's action of hitting her husband is wrong. The answer should be A. Yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
