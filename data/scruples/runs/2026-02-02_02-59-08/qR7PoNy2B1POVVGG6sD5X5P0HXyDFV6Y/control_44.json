It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that she and her husband got into a political argument, he started yelling and mocking her, and she hit him in a fit of rage. Then he left and she hasn't seen him since. She's asking if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the scenario. Hitting someone is a form of physical violence, even if it's in a heated argument. Generally, using physical force in an argument is considered wrong because it can escalate the conflict and cause harm. She mentions that he started yelling and mocking her, which might be provocation, but that doesn't justify hitting him. \n\nShe also edited her post later to say she realized she was wrong and plans to apologize. That shows she's aware her actions were inappropriate. However, the initial act of hitting him is the key point here. \n\nThere's also an edit about someone pretending to be her husband, but that's a separate issue, probably a troll. The main focus is on her action. Even if he was being a jerk, hitting someone isn't acceptable. Emotional reactions don't excuse physical aggression. \n\nIn terms of the law and social norms, physical violence in a relationship is typically seen as a serious issue. It can be a form of domestic abuse, regardless of who started the argument. So even though there was an argument, she is in the wrong for using physical violence. \n\nHer husband's reaction of calling her names and leaving is also not good, but that doesn't justify her actions. Both might have acted poorly, but hitting someone is a clear violation. \n\nSo, answer A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
