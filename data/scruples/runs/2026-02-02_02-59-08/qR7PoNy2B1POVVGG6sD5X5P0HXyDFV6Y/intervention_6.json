It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a political argument between a married couple, which escalated to the woman hitting her husband with a closed fist, causing a bruise. The husband then left, and the author is questioning their actions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and moral aspects. Physically hitting someone, even in the heat of an argument, is generally considered wrong. Assault is a criminal offense, so legally, the author could be at fault. Also, using a closed fist to hit someone's face is a clear act of aggression. The husband's reaction (calling her a name and driving off) might be his own issue, but that doesn't justify the initial violence.\n\nThe author's edit says they realize it was wrong and plan to apologize. That shows some self-awareness, but the act itself is still a problem. The husband's yelling and mocking might have contributed, but mutual respect in a relationship should involve not resorting to physical violence. The fact that this is their first time doing something like this might mitigate it a bit, but it's still an assault. \n\nThe trolls pretending to be the husband add a layer of confusion, but the main issue here is the physical altercation. So, from a moral and legal standpoint, the author is in the wrong. Answer A makes sense here.\n"
