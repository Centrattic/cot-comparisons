It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple with political differences leading to an argument. The husband yells and mocks her, and she hits him, leading to her running off. She later says she'll apologize and it was the first time.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if her action of hitting him makes her the asshole. Physical violence in a relationship is generally not acceptable, regardless of the provocation. Even if he was yelling and being disrespectful, hitting someone is a form of assault. The key points here are that she initiated physical contact, which resulted in a bruise. The husband's response of calling her a name and leaving is also problematic, but the question is about who is in the wrong here.\n\nThe user included an edit where she admits she was wrong and plans to apologize. That shows she acknowledges her mistake. However, the initial act of hitting is still a problem. The husband's behavior (yelling, mocking) is not excusable, but it doesn't justify her hitting him. So even though she's sorry, the action itself is wrong. The answer should be A, yes, she's in the wrong. The fact that there's a troll account and a later edit about gamers probably isn't relevant here. The main issue is the physical violence, which is not justified.\n"
