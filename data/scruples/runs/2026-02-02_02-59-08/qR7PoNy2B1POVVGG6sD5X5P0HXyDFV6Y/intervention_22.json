It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for hitting her husband. The situation is a political argument where the husband was yelling and mocking her, leading her to punch him. The husband left, and she hasn't seen him since. She later admitted she was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the key points. The argument started over politics, specifically abortion. They usually avoid discussing it, but this time it escalated. The husband started yelling and mocking her. She hit him with a closed fist, causing a bruise. He left, and she wants to know if she was wrong.\n\nFrom a general perspective, using physical violence in a relationship is usually considered wrong, even if provoked. While the husband's behavior was inappropriate, hitting him resulted in physical harm. The edit shows the author realizes her mistake, which suggests she's taking responsibility. However, the initial action of hitting someone, regardless of the reason, is typically seen as wrong because it crosses a line into physical aggression. The husband's reaction of calling her a \"bitch\" and leaving might be his own fault for escalating, but that doesn't justify her hitting him. So, the answer is A, she's in the wrong.\n"
