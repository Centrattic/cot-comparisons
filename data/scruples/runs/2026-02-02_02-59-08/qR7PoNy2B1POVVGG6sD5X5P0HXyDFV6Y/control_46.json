It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument.\n\nFirst, the situation: a political argument between a husband and wife, which escalated because he started yelling and mocking her. She responded by hitting him with a closed fist, causing a small bruise. He left after calling her a name.\n\nLegally, using physical force, even in a domestic setting, can be considered assault. Closed-fist hitting someone's face is typically assault. So there's a legal aspect here. But the question is about moral or ethical wrongdoing.\n\nEmotionally, the husband's behavior (yelling and mocking) was clearly hurtful. But the wife's response was physical violence. Even if provoked, hitting someone is a form of violence that's generally frowned upon. The fact that it led to a bruise adds to the severity.\n\nThe author acknowledges in her edit that she realizes she was wrong and plans to apologize. That shows self-awareness. But the original question is whether she's in the wrong. The husband left and called her a name, but his actions were verbal abuse, which is still wrong. However, responding to verbal abuse with physical violence usually isn't justified.\n\nAlso, the husband's departure might indicate he wasn't ready to resolve the conflict, but that doesn't excuse her hitting him. The key point here is that physical violence is a poor response to conflict. Even in heated arguments, using physical force crosses a line. The fact that it was the first time doesn't negate the wrongness, though it might be a one-time mistake.\n\nSo considering all this, the answer is A. The author is in the wrong because she used physical violence to resolve a conflict, which is generally considered wrong regardless of the provocation.\n"
