It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who hit her husband during an argument is in the wrong. The situation started with a political disagreement, which escalated into yelling and mockery from the husband. The wife then hit him with a closed fist, causing a bruise. After that, he left, and she hasn't seen him since.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the act of physical violence itself. Even if provoked, using a closed fist to hit someone's face is a form of assault. In many jurisdictions, that's a criminal offense, regardless of the reason. So legally, she might be in the wrong here. But the question is about whether she's an \"asshole,\" which is more about social norms and moral judgment rather than legal technicalities.\n\nThe argument was about politics, which can be a sensitive topic. They usually ignore their differences, but this time it got worse. The husband was yelling and mocking her, which could be seen as emotional abuse or disrespect. However, responding with physical violence is a step that's generally frowned upon, even in heated arguments. It crosses a line that verbal arguments don't.\n\nThe edits add some context. She realizes her mistake and plans to apologize, which shows remorse. The first edit mentions a troll account, which might be a red herring but shows the situation is getting attention. The second edit clarifies that she acknowledges her wrongdoing, indicating she's taking responsibility.\n\nHowever, the final edit with \"GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\" seems out of place. It could be a troll move or an attempt to downplay the seriousness, but it might also be a way to get more upvotes. Either way, it doesn't reflect well on the situation's gravity.\n\nIn terms of social norms, using physical violence in a relationship is almost always considered wrong. Even if the other person was being abusive, the response should ideally be non-violent. There are better ways to de-escalate a situation than hitting someone. The husband's behavior was wrong too\u2014yelling and mocking are disrespectful and can be abusive. But the question is about the wife's actions.\n\nSo, even though the husband was at fault in the argument, the wife's response of hitting him makes her in the wrong. The fact that she realizes this and wants to apologize is a mitigating factor, but the act itself is a clear violation of non-violence in relationships.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A: Yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
