It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the person who hit their husband is in the wrong. The situation involves a political argument leading to physical violence.\n\nFirst, the user is a Democrat and her husband is a Republican. They usually avoid political arguments but had a big one about abortion. He started yelling and mocking her, which led her to hit him with a closed fist. He then left, and she hasn't seen him since. She's asking if she's the asshole here.\n\nIn most places, using physical force in an argument, even in self-defense or out of anger, can be considered assault. Even if the other person was yelling, that doesn't justify hitting them. The key here is that violence escalates conflicts and can lead to legal consequences. She acknowledges her mistake in an edit, which shows some self-awareness, but the initial action was wrong.\n\nThe husband's response (calling her a name and leaving) is hurtful, but that doesn't make her hitting him acceptable. Physical violence is a clear line that's crossed here. So the answer leans towards A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
