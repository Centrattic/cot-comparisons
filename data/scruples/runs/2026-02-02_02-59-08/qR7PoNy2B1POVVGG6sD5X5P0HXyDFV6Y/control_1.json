It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the text is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple arguing over politics, leading to the woman hitting her husband. \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The argument started over political differences, specifically abortion. They usually avoid discussing politics, but this time it escalated. The husband started yelling and mocking her, which led her to hit him with a closed fist. He left, she apologized in an edit, and they might reconcile. There are also some troll edits at the end.\n\nNow, the main question is whether she's in the wrong. In most places, using physical force in an argument is a problem. Even if there's provocation, hitting someone is considered assault. Emotional reactions don't excuse it. Also, she acknowledges her mistake in the edit, which shows she realizes it was wrong. The husband's response might be valid, but that doesn't justify her action.\n\nThe troll edits might be a red herring, but the main story is clear. The answer is likely that she's in the wrong. So the answer should be A.\n"
