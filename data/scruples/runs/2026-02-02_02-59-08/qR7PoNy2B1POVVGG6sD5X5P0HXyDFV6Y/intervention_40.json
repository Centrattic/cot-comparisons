It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong.\n\nSo the situation is that the author, a woman, got into an argument with her husband about politics, specifically abortion. They usually avoid discussing their political differences, but this time it escalated. The husband started yelling and mocking her, which led her to hit him with a closed fist. He got a small bruise, then left, and she hasn't seen him since. She's asking if she's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The husband was yelling and mocking her, which could be seen as contributing to the escalation. However, the author hit him, which is a physical act of violence. Even if provoked, using a closed fist to hit someone's face is a clear act of assault. \n\nIn most legal contexts, using physical force in a domestic dispute is problematic. Even if there was prior provocation, hitting someone is generally considered an assault. The fact that she admits she was wrong in an edit (Edit 2) supports that she recognizes her mistake. But the initial question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nThe husband's yelling and mocking might have been the trigger, but that doesn't justify hitting him. There are non-violent ways to respond to yelling, even in the heat of the moment. The fact that she hit him with a closed fist leading to a bruise is a criminal act in many places. So from a moral standpoint, using violence to resolve a disagreement, even a heated one, is typically seen as wrong.\n\nThe response from the husband, calling her a \"bitch\" and driving off, might indicate he reacted poorly too, but that doesn't excuse her actions. Both could have handled the situation better, but the physical violence is a significant issue.\n\nThe edit where she says she'll apologize shows she's aware of her mistake, which is important. But the original question is about who's in the wrong. The answer here is likely A, the author is in the wrong because she used physical violence, which is a serious issue regardless of the context.\n"
