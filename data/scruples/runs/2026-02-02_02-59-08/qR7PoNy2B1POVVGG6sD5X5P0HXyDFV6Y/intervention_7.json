It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for hitting her husband during a political argument. The situation started with a disagreement about politics, specifically abortion, where they have different views. The husband started yelling and mocking her, which led her to hit him with a closed fist, causing a small bruise. Then he left, and she's questioning if she's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Physical violence in relationships is generally not acceptable, regardless of the provocation. Even if the husband was yelling and mocking her, hitting him is a form of physical aggression that escalates the conflict. The key point here is that using physical force to resolve an argument is not appropriate, no matter how heated the discussion gets. \n\nThe author mentions that this is the first time such a thing has happened, and she plans to apologize. While that shows remorse, the act itself is still wrong. The husband's response, calling her a \"bitch\" and leaving, might indicate his own inappropriate reaction, but that doesn't justify her hitting him. It's important to distinguish between reactions and accountability. Even if someone else's behavior is inconsiderate or abusive, retaliating with violence isn't justified and can have serious consequences.\n\nAlso, the fact that she initiated physical contact, even in a moment of rage, makes her responsible. The edits where she acknowledges her mistake and plans to apologize are positive, but they don't negate the initial wrongdoing. The situation highlights the need for better conflict resolution strategies, like taking a break from the argument or seeking communication methods that avoid physical harm.\n\nThe mention of a troll account pretending to be her husband might complicate the situation, but the physical act she committed is her own responsibility. The final edit about \"GAMERS RISE UP\" seems irrelevant and possibly a joke or mistake, so I can ignore that.\n\nIn conclusion, while the husband's behavior contributed to the tension, the author took an action that crossed a line. Physical violence is never acceptable in a relationship, regardless of the circumstances. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
