It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the given text is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple having a political argument, leading to the wife hitting her husband. The husband started yelling and mocking her, which led to the punch. Then he left, and she's questioning if she was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The argument was over politics, which they usually avoid, but this time escalated. The husband was yelling and mocking, which is aggressive behavior. The wife responded by hitting him with a closed fist, causing a bruise. She later regrets it and wants to apologize. Now, the main issue is whether her action of hitting is wrong.\n\nIn most contexts, using physical violence in a relationship is not acceptable, regardless of the provocation. Even if the husband was yelling, that doesn't justify a physical attack. The author acknowledges her mistake in an edit, but the initial action was a punch. So, even if the husband acted inappropriately, the wife's response crosses into physical aggression, which is a problem. \n\nHowever, some might argue that if the husband was being verbally abusive, it could be seen as self-defense or a reaction to provocation. But in legal terms and in most social contexts, mutual escalation doesn't excuse physical violence. Also, the fact that she later wants to apologize and make up suggests she recognizes the wrongdoing.\n\nThe edits also mention a troll account pretending to be her husband, but the user isn't involved in that. The final edit is a random comment which doesn't affect the main issue. \n\nSo, putting it all together: the author hit her husband in response to yelling, which is not acceptable. Therefore, she is in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
