It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is that she and her husband had a political argument, he was yelling and mocking her, and she hit him. Then he left, and now she's wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, the key points here are physical violence. She admits she hit him with a closed fist to the face, causing a bruise. Even if there was provocation like yelling and mocking, using physical violence is generally considered wrong in relationships. The question is whether her actions cross the line.\n\nThe edits are important. In her second edit, she realizes her mistake and says she'll apologize. That shows she's taking responsibility. Also, the first edit mentions that someone is pretending to be her husband, so maybe there's drama. But the main issue is the initial action.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, even if the husband was being an ass, hitting him is a problem. Relationships should avoid physical violence. So the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong. But I need to make sure there aren't mitigating factors. The fact that it's the first time and she's remorseful doesn't change the fact that hitting is wrong. So yeah, answer A.\n"
