It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for hitting her husband. The situation is an argument about politics leading to her punching him. The initial thought is that she's in the wrong, but I need to consider all aspects.\n\nFirst, domestic violence is a serious issue. Even if there was provocation, like yelling and mocking, using physical violence is generally not acceptable. The fact that the husband left and she hasn't seen him since might indicate some consequences. She acknowledges her mistake in the edit and plans to apologize. But does that change the fact that she hit him?\n\nThe argument was political, which can be a sensitive topic. They usually ignore differences, but this time it escalated. He started yelling and mocking, which could be seen as contributing to the situation. However, that doesn't justify hitting him. People should resolve conflicts without physical harm.\n\nThe author's edit shows self-awareness, but the act itself is still wrong. Even if it was a first-time incident, the action is a violation of mutual respect in a relationship. The troll account comment might be a red herring. The main issue is the use of physical violence.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer is A. The author is in the wrong because hitting her husband, regardless of the context, is not acceptable. The husband's behavior was also inappropriate, but it doesn't justify her actions. The key point is that physical aggression is not a valid response.\n"
