It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument. So, first, I need to look at the details she provided.\n\nShe mentions that they had a political argument about abortion, which escalated into yelling and mocking. She says she hit him with a closed fist, causing a small bruise. Then he left, and she hasn't seen him since. She's asking if she's the asshole here.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, using physical force in a domestic argument is generally not okay. Even if there was provocation, hitting someone can be considered assault. So legally, she might be in the wrong. Emotionally, she admits she was in a fit of rage, but that doesn't excuse the action. The husband's response was to call her a name and leave, but his initial yelling and mocking might have contributed.\n\nHowever, the key point here is that she used physical violence. Even if the argument was heated, hitting someone is a violation of their personal space and safety. The fact that she later realizes she's wrong and wants to apologize shows she acknowledges this, but the action itself is still problematic.\n\nI should also consider that in many places, mutual combat or self-defense might be factors, but there's no indication here that he was physically aggressive before she hit him. He was yelling and mocking, which is verbal abuse but not necessarily a direct threat of physical harm. So her response crosses a line.\n\nAdditionally, the edits show she's trying to clarify and take responsibility, which is positive, but the initial act of hitting is still the main issue. The fact that she hasn't seen him since and he called her a name might indicate a pattern of conflict, but that doesn't justify her actions.\n\nSo, putting it all together, even though the situation was tense, resorting to physical violence is wrong. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
