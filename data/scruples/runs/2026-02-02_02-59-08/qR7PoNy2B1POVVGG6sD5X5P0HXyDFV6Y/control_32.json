It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that the author punched her husband during an argument about politics, leading to a bruise. The husband then left.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if hitting someone, even in an argument, is wrong. Physical violence in a relationship is generally considered unacceptable. Even if there's yelling or provocation, using physical force crosses a line. The author admits it was wrong in her edit, which is a key point.\n\nThe husband's behavior included yelling and mocking, which is not okay, but that doesn't justify the author hitting him. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since she used physical violence, which is a more severe action, she is at fault. The husband's response of calling her a name and leaving is also not great, but the physical act is worse in this context.\n\nAlso, the edits show she's aware she was wrong and plans to apologize. The troll edit might be a red herring, but the main issue is the punch. The title \"Am I the Asshole\" suggests she's considering her actions wrong. So the answer should be A, yes, she's in the wrong.\n"
