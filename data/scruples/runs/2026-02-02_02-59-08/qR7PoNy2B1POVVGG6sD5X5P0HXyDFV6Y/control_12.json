It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're the asshole for hitting their husband during an argument. The situation was a political disagreement, which escalated because he was yelling and mocking her. She hit him with a closed fist, causing a small bruise. Then he left, and she's wondering if she's wrong.\n\nFirst, physical violence is generally not acceptable in any relationship, regardless of the provocation. Even if he was being loud or disrespectful, hitting someone is a form of assault. The fact that it was a closed fist to the face is significant. She admitted in her edit that she realizes what she did was wrong, which shows some self-awareness. But the act itself is problematic.\n\nThe husband's response of calling her a name and driving off might be his way of handling it, but that doesn't justify her hitting him. Both parties might have acted inappropriately, but the question is specifically about the author. Since she initiated physical aggression, that's a clear wrong action. Even if there was mutual escalation, the act of hitting is a violation. So the answer should be A, yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
