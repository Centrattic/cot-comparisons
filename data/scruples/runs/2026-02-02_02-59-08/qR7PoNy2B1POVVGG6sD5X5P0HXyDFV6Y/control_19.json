It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. They had an argument with their husband about politics, which escalated into him yelling and mocking her. She then hit him with a closed fist, causing a bruise. He left and she hasn't seen him since. The question is whether she's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The argument started over political differences, which they usually ignore. But this time it got heated. He started yelling and mocking her, which is pretty aggressive. She responded by hitting him. Even though he was being a jerk, using physical violence is a problem. Closed fist to the face is assault, regardless of provocation. She then didn't see him for hours, and he left in anger. \n\nIn most places, assault is a crime, so she's legally in the wrong. Even if there's mutual anger, hitting someone is not acceptable. The fact that she acknowledges her mistake in the edit and plans to apologize shows she realizes it was wrong. But the action itself is still a problem. The husband's yelling and mocking are not justifiable for her to hit him. It's a cycle of violence, and the solution isn't to retaliate. \n\nAlso, the edits mention a troll account and a random comment, but those aren't relevant to the main question. The key is that she used physical violence in response to verbal abuse. Even if the husband was at fault for yelling, her response was not appropriate. So the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
