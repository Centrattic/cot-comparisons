It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is that during an argument about politics, the husband was yelling and mocking the author, leading her to hit him with a closed fist. Now he's gone, and she's questioning if she was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the basics of domestic violence and self-defense. In most cases, using physical violence in an argument is not acceptable, regardless of the provocation. Even if the husband was yelling, that doesn't justify hitting him. The author admitted in an edit that she realizes she was wrong, so that's a point towards her acknowledging her mistake.\n\nBut wait, sometimes people might act out in the heat of the moment. However, the law typically doesn't excuse hitting someone unless it's self-defense to prevent imminent harm. The question is whether the husband's yelling and mocking constitute a threat serious enough for self-defense. Probably not, so the author's action would be considered assault.\n\nAlso, the fact that she hit him with a closed fist to the face is a significant act of violence. Even if it was a one-time thing, it's still a serious action. The husband then left, which complicates things, but that doesn't make her action right.\n\nLooking at the edits, she plans to apologize and says it was a first-time incident. She might be taking responsibility, but the initial act is still the issue. The troll account comment and the last edit about \"GAMERS RISE UP\" seem like possible distractions or trolling, so maybe not relevant to the core issue.\n\nSo overall, the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong because using physical violence in this context isn't justified and is considered wrong regardless of the provocation. The husband's actions don't warrant a physical response, so the author's action is the problem here.\n"
