It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for hitting their husband during an argument. The situation involves political differences, yelling, and a physical altercation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author says they got into a political argument, he started yelling and mocking her, she hit him, and then he left. She's questioning if she's the asshole for punching him or if he's overreacting.\n\nIn most contexts, using physical violence, even in a heated argument, is generally considered wrong. Hitting someone is assault, regardless of the provocation. Even if the husband was yelling and being disrespectful, that doesn't justify a punch. The author acknowledges in her edit that she realizes it was wrong and plans to apologize, which shows some self-awareness. However, the act itself is still a problem because it's a criminal offense in many places and can escalate conflicts.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband's behavior of yelling and mocking might have contributed to the situation. But that doesn't make the woman's response acceptable. The line between defending oneself and using excessive force is important here. Since the husband didn't use physical violence first, her hitting him is the aggressive act.\n\nAlso, the edit about a troll account trying to pretend to be her husband is a red herring and doesn't affect the main issue. The final edit with \"GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\" is an edit she made, which might be a joke, but it's not relevant to the main question.\n\nIn terms of societal norms and legal standards, using physical violence in a domestic dispute is typically seen as wrong. So the author is in the wrong here.\n"
