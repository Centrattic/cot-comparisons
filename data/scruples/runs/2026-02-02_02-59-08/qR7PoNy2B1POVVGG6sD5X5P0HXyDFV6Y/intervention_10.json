It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

The situation is that they had a political argument, he started yelling and mocking her, and she hit him. Now, they want to know if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. Physical violence in a relationship is a serious issue. Even if the husband was yelling and being rude, hitting him with a closed fist to the face is a violent act. While the husband's behavior might have been triggering, using physical force in response can escalate the situation. It's important to note that mutual respect and non-violence are key in relationships. The fact that she realized her mistake later and plans to apologize shows remorse, but the action itself is still wrong. The husband's response of driving off might be his way of handling the situation, but that doesn't justify the physical assault. So, the author used violence, which is unacceptable regardless of the provocation. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n"
