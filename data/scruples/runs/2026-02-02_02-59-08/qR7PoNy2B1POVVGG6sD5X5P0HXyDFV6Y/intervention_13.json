It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that she and her husband got into a political argument, he started yelling and mocking her, and in a rage she hit him in the face with a closed fist. Then he left, she hasn't seen him since. She's wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. Physical violence in a relationship is generally a serious issue. Even if there were provocation, like yelling and mocking, using a closed fist to hit someone in the face is a violent act. The question is whether that makes her in the wrong.\n\nThe husband's behavior is also part of the scenario. He was yelling and mocking, which is disrespectful and could escalate tensions. However, the fact that he left after she hit him and called her a name complicates things. But the main focus is on her action.\n\nIn most contexts, using physical force in an argument, especially when it results in a bruise, is considered a form of domestic abuse. Even if it's the first time and she plans to apologize, the act itself is wrong. The law and societal norms typically view any intentional physical harm as unacceptable, regardless of the reason. So, despite the context, the author initiated physical violence, which is a clear wrong.\n\nShe also edited her post later to acknowledge her mistake, which shows some self-awareness. But that doesn't negate the action. The question is about whether she was wrong, not whether she's a bad person overall. So answer A makes sense here.\n"
