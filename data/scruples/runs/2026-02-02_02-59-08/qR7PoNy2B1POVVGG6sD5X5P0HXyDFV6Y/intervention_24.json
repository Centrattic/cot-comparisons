It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe user is a woman who had a political argument with her Republican husband. They usually ignore their differences, but this time it escalated. He started yelling and mocking her, and in a fit of rage, she hit him in the face with a closed fist. He ran off, came back later with a small bruise, called her a name, took his car, and left. She hasn't seen him since. She's asking if she's the asshole for punching him or if he's just being a baby.\n\nFirst, I should consider the context. They had a disagreement about politics, which is a sensitive topic. He was yelling and mocking, which is disrespectful. The user hit him, leading to a bruise. She later realizes she was wrong and wants to apologize. The question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nPhysical violence is generally not acceptable, regardless of the provocation. Even if someone yells or mocks you, hitting them is a form of assault. However, the situation might be viewed differently depending on cultural or personal beliefs. Some might argue that self-defense or retaliation under emotional stress could be mitigating factors. But in most legal and ethical frameworks, using physical force to resolve an argument, even in anger, crosses a line.\n\nThe user also mentions it's her first time doing something like that and that they can make up. She acknowledges her actions were wrong in the edit. But the act itself\u2014hitting someone in the face causing a bruise\u2014is a clear physical aggression. The husband's response of calling her a name and leaving might be part of the cycle of abuse, but that doesn't justify her hitting him.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, violence in arguments is frowned upon. Even if both parties contributed emotionally (yelling, mocking), physical violence escalates the conflict beyond words. The key issue here is that she used physical force, which is a direct violation of mutual respect and safety in a relationship.\n\nSo, considering all that, answering A (the author is in the wrong) seems appropriate. While the husband's behavior was also inappropriate, the use of physical violence is a more severe transgression. The user's realization and apology are positive, but they don't negate the wrong action itself.\n"
