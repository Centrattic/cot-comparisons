It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation involves an argument between a husband and wife about politics, specifically abortion, leading to the woman hitting her husband. The husband then left and hasn't returned.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The couple usually ignores their political differences, but this argument escalated. The husband started yelling and mocking her, which led her to hit him. She admits it was wrong in her edit and plans to apologize. The husband called her a name and drove off.\n\nNow, the main issue is whether the author is at fault. Physical violence in a relationship is generally considered wrong, regardless of the provocation. Even if the husband was being aggressive, hitting him was a physical escalation. However, there's context that the husband was yelling and mocking her first. But in most cases, using physical force in an argument, even in self-defense or anger, is not justified. \n\nAlso, the author acknowledges her mistake in the edit, which shows she realizes it was wrong. The husband's response of leaving and calling her a name isn't excusing her actions, but it shows there was mutual escalation. However, physical violence is a more severe action than verbal. So the author's action of hitting is a key factor here.\n\nIn many legal and social contexts, any form of physical assault, even between spouses, is considered wrong. The fact that it was a closed-fist hit to the face would likely be categorized as assault. Even if the husband was being aggressive, the appropriate response isn't to hit back. The author should have de-escalated the situation instead.\n\nThe edits also mention that this was the first time such a thing happened and they can make up. But the initial action is still problematic. The husband's behavior was also not okay (yelling and mocking), but hitting someone crosses a line. So the answer would be that the author is in the wrong, answer A.\n"
