It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The person is asking if they're the asshole for hitting their husband during an argument. The situation is that they had a political disagreement, which escalated. The husband started yelling and mocking her, and in a fit of rage, she hit him with a closed fist, causing a small bruise. He then left, and now she's wondering if she was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if her action was justified. Physical violence in a relationship is generally not acceptable, regardless of the provocation. Even if the husband was yelling and being disrespectful, hitting him isn't a reasonable response. While emotional reactions can be intense, using physical force can lead to further harm and sets a bad precedent. \n\nAlso, the fact that she later realized her mistake and plans to apologize is a positive step, but that doesn't negate the initial wrongdoing. The key point here is that violence is never the solution in an argument. Even if both sides are at fault in the argument, the act of hitting someone crosses a line. The husband's behavior (yelling, mocking) was inappropriate too, but that doesn't give her the right to hit him. \n\nThe edits mention she's aware of her mistake now, which shows some self-reflection, but the question is about whether she's in the wrong. So, yes, she is in the wrong for using physical violence. The answer should be A.\n"
