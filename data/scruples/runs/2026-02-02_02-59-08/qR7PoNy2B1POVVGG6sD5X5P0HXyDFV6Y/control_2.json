It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument. The situation involves political differences leading to a heated argument where the husband started yelling and mocking her, which led her to hit him. She then says she'll apologize and that it was the first time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. While the husband's behavior (yelling and mocking) was inappropriate, the key point here is that the author physically hit him. Physical violence in a relationship is generally considered a serious issue, regardless of the provocation. Even if the husband was at fault for yelling, the response of hitting is a form of domestic violence. \n\nThe user's edit mentions that she realizes she was wrong and plans to apologize. However, the question is about whether she's in the wrong. Most perspectives would agree that using physical violence is incorrect, even if there was a prior provocation. It's important to note that while the husband's behavior contributed to the conflict, it doesn't justify a physical response. \n\nThere's also the note about the troll account pretending to be her husband, but that's likely a red herring. The main issue here is her action. The final edit with a provocative message (\"GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\") might be a joke or a distraction, but it doesn't affect the main ethical assessment.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer would be A, as using physical violence is wrong regardless of the circumstances.\n"
