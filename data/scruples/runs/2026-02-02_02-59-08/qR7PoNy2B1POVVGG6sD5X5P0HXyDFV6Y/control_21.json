It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" story is in the wrong. The situation is that she had a political argument with her Republican husband, he was yelling and mocking her, and she hit him in the face with a closed fist. Now he's gone, and she's questioning if she was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points here. Physical violence in a relationship is a big issue. Even if there was an argument and provocation, hitting someone is a form of assault. Most places have laws against domestic violence, so legally, she might be in trouble. But the question is about being in the wrong morally or socially, not just legally.\n\nShe mentions it was a closed-fist hit to the face causing a bruise. That's pretty clear physical aggression. The husband responded by calling her a name and leaving. She says she'll apologize and it was the first time. But the action itself is significant. Even if the husband was being an asshole, using physical violence isn't justified in most people's eyes. \n\nAlso, in \"AITA\" contexts, people often look at both sides. The husband was yelling and mocking, which is bad, but the wife escalated it with a punch. The community usually frowns upon physical violence, regardless of the reason. So even if both had faults, the punch is a major point against her.\n\nThe edits at the end might be red herrings. The troll account part is probably just to add drama, but the main issue is the punch. Also, the last edit with \"GAMERS RISE UP\" seems like a spam edit, perhaps to disrupt, but the user has already made that edit.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely that she is in the wrong. Physical violence is a serious issue, and even if provoked, it's not an acceptable response. The fact that she's going to apologize shows she recognizes this, and the community would likely say she's the asshole for using violence.\n"
