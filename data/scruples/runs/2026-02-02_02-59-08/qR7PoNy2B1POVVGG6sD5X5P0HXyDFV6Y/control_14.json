It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see here. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple arguing about politics, leading to the husband yelling and mocking her, and then she hits him. The author is asking if they're the asshole for punching him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Physical violence in a relationship is generally considered wrong, regardless of the provocation. Even if the husband was yelling or being disrespectful, hitting him with a closed fist is an escalation. The author admits that this was the first time such a thing happened and that they plan to apologize, which suggests they recognize it was wrong.\n\nThere's also the part where the husband ran off and she didn't see him for a few hours. He came back with a bruise and called her a derogatory term before leaving. The author's actions led to physical harm, even if minor, and that's a red flag. While the husband's behavior was inappropriate too (yelling, mocking, name-calling), using physical force in response isn't justified. \n\nThe edits at the end show that the author later acknowledges their mistake, but the initial act still stands. The key point here is that violence is not an acceptable response, no matter the argument. So, even if the husband was in the wrong in the argument, hitting him makes the author responsible for the physical aggression. \n\nAlso, the fact that there was a troll account pretending to be the husband adds some noise, but the main issue remains the physical altercation. The author's realization that they were wrong and their intention to apologize support the conclusion that they were in the wrong. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they resorted to physical violence, which is generally not acceptable.\n"
