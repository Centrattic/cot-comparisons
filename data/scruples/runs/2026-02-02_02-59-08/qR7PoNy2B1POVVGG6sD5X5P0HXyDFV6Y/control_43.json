It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that they had a political argument with their husband, he started yelling and mocking them, and in a fit of rage, the author hit him with a closed fist to the face. Now, the husband has a bruise and left, and the author is wondering if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the use of physical violence. Even if the argument was intense, hitting someone in the face with a closed fist is a clear act of assault. The author admits they're different in political views but says they usually ignore it. This time, it escalated. Now, while the husband did start yelling and mocking, which might have provoked the author, that doesn't justify a physical response. The author's edit 2 says they realize their mistake and plan to apologize, which shows they acknowledge wrongdoing. So, yes, the author is in the wrong for using violence. But wait, the husband also called them a \"bitch\" and drove off. Does that mean he's also at fault? Maybe, but the question is about the author's actions. The author's main issue is the assault. Even if provoked, it's not an excuse. So the answer should be A.\n"
