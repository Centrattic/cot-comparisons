It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for hitting her husband. The situation involves a political argument between a Republican husband and a Democratic wife about abortion. They usually avoid discussing politics, but this time it escalated. He started yelling and mocking her, so she hit him with a closed fist. He left and she hasn't seen him since. She's considering apologizing.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The argument was about a sensitive topic (abortion), which can be really heated. The husband escalated the situation by yelling and mocking, which is abusive behavior. The wife responded with a physical attack. Even if provoked, hitting someone is not acceptable. Physical violence is wrong in any relationship, regardless of provocation.\n\nThe edits show she realizes her mistake and plans to apologize. However, the initial action was a closed fist to the face, which is a clear act of assault. Even if the husband was being inappropriate, the appropriate response isn't physical. The fact that she hit him first makes her at fault. The husband's behavior was also wrong, but that doesn't justify her actions. Both have issues, but the question is about her wrongdoing.\n\nThe answer should be A because she crossed a line with physical violence. Even if the husband was being an asshole, she shouldn't have hit him. The answer is A.\n"
