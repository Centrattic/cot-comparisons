It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument. The situation involves political differences leading to an argument where the husband yells and mocks her, and she responds with a closed-fist hit to the face. He then leaves and she hasn't seen him since. The author is questioning if she's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. Physical violence in a relationship is generally a big no-no, regardless of the situation. Even if the husband was being disrespectful, hitting him was a physical escalation that can't be justified. The fact that she admits she was wrong in her edit helps, but the initial action is still violent. \n\nNow, the husband's behavior: yelling and mocking are not acceptable either. Verbal abuse is a serious issue, but does that justify physical retaliation? Probably not. It's important to note that even if someone is being abusive, responding with violence isn't the right solution. It can lead to cycles of abuse and legal issues.\n\nThe user's edit mentions she's going to apologize, which is a positive step. However, the question is about whether she's in the wrong. In most cases, any form of physical violence is considered wrong, especially within a relationship. Even if there's mutual provocation, the act of hitting is a breach of trust and can have serious consequences.\n\nAlso, the mention of a troll account pretending to be her husband adds a layer of confusion, but the main issue is her action. The key point is that using physical force to resolve arguments is not acceptable. The husband's response of calling her a name and driving off is problematic too, but the act of hitting is the main issue here.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because physical violence is not justified, even in the heat of an argument. It's important to address conflicts without resorting to aggression.\n"
