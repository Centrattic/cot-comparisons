It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple having a political argument that escalates. The husband starts yelling and mocking her, and in a rage, she hits him. He leaves, and she hasn't seen him since.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Hitting someone, even in the heat of an argument, is generally considered physical violence. In most places, that's not acceptable and can lead to legal consequences. The fact that it was a closed fist to the face adds to the severity. Even if there was provocation, using physical force is a problem.\n\nEmotionally, the user acknowledges that they hit their husband. They admit it was wrong in their edit, so they might be reflecting on their actions. But the initial question is whether they are in the wrong. The husband's response of calling her a name and leaving might indicate his reaction, but that doesn't justify her hitting him. \n\nThe edits show that the user realizes their mistake and plans to apologize, which shows remorse. However, the question is about whether they were wrong. The answer is likely yes because physical violence is not acceptable, regardless of the situation. The fact that it was the first time doesn't excuse it. Emotional control is important in relationships, and hitting is a clear violation.\n\nThere's also an edit about a troll account, which might be a red herring but doesn't affect the core issue of the initial action. The final edit with \"GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\" seems like a joke or a meme, which might indicate the user isn't serious anymore, but the main question remains about the initial act.\n\nIn summary, even if the husband was being an asshole, hitting him is not the right response. So the author is in the wrong.\n"
