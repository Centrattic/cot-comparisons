It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument. \n\nFirst, the situation: they had a political argument about abortion, which escalated into him yelling and mocking her. She then hit him with a closed fist, causing a small bruise. He left after calling her a name. She later apologized.\n\nSo, physical violence is generally not acceptable, even in arguments. Even if the husband was being disrespectful, hitting him crosses a line. The fact that she admitted it was wrong in her edit shows she recognizes this. But the question is whether she's in the wrong. \n\nThe husband's behavior (yelling, mocking) is also not great. But using physical violence as a response is a problem. In most cases, violence is not justified regardless of the provocation. The law would likely side that she is at fault for using physical aggression. Also, in relationships, using violence can escalate issues and harm trust, even if she's sorry later.\n\nThere's also the edit about a troll account and the offensive edit at the end. But that's probably unrelated to the main question. The main focus is on the punch. \n\nSo the answer is A, yes, she's in the wrong for hitting him. Even if there was a reason, violence isn't acceptable. The husband's behavior isn't excusable either, but the question is about her.\n"
