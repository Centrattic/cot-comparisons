It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument. The situation involves a political disagreement between a Republican husband and a Democratic wife, which escalated into an argument where he started yelling and mocking her. In a moment of rage, she hit him with a closed fist, leading to a small bruise. He left afterward, and she hasn't seen him since. She's asking if she's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. Physical violence in a relationship is a serious issue regardless of the context. The author admits she acted out of rage and hit her husband. Even though the argument was about political differences, which they usually don't engage in, the decision to use physical force crosses a line. The husband's yelling and mockery might have contributed to the escalation, but that doesn't justify the physical response. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to resolve conflicts without resorting to violence. The author later realizes her mistake and plans to apologize, indicating she acknowledges her wrongdoing. The edit where she admits fault is significant. \n\nThe other party's response (her husband) is also a factor. He left and called her a name, which isn't helpful, but his actions don't excuse her hitting him. The presence of a possible troll account complicates the situation but isn't directly relevant to the question of whether she was in the wrong. \n\nThe final edit about \"GAMERS RISE UP\" seems like an irrelevant or offensive addition, possibly from a troll, but that's not part of the original question. \n\nConsidering all factors, using physical violence is a clear wrong action. Even if there was provocation, the appropriate response isn't to hit. The author's own admission of wrongdoing in the edit supports that she is in the wrong. So the answer should be A.\n"
