It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who hit their husband is in the wrong. The scenario is a political argument where the husband was yelling and mocking, leading to the woman hitting him with a closed fist. Then the husband left and didn't come back.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. While the husband's behavior might have contributed by yelling and mocking, physical violence is generally not acceptable, even in arguments. The woman used a closed fist to hit his face, which can be considered assault. Even if provoked, hitting someone is a violation of their physical safety. The husband's response of calling her a name and leaving might be his way of handling it, but that doesn't justify the initial action.\n\nAlso, the woman later admits she was wrong and plans to apologize, which is a good step. However, the fact remains that using physical violence in a domestic setting is a serious issue. There's a power dynamic in relationships, and using physical force can escalate conflicts and set a dangerous precedent. \n\nEven though there might be mutual blame in the argument, the act of hitting is a clear violation. The husband's yelling and mocking are inappropriate too, but physical assault is typically more severe. The woman's action could have led to more serious consequences, and it's important to address that. \n\nSo, considering all that, the woman is in the wrong for physically hitting her husband. The answer should be A.\n"
