It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument. The situation involves a political disagreement that escalated into physical violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple usually ignores their political differences, but this time the argument got heated. The husband started yelling and mocking her, which led her to hit him. She admits it was a closed fist to the face, resulting in a bruise. Then he left, and she hasn't seen him since. She's asking if she's the asshole for punching him or if he's overreacting.\n\nNow, looking at the edits: she clarifies that she realizes her mistake and plans to apologize, and she mentions it was a first-time incident. There's also an edit about a troll account, which might be a red herring but could indicate some online drama. The last edit seems like a random addition, possibly to mock the situation or the platform.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, physical violence is generally not acceptable, regardless of the provocation. Even if the husband was yelling and mocking, hitting him is a criminal act and can be considered assault. The fact that she took the time to write this up and later admitted her mistake shows some self-awareness, but that doesn't justify the action. The husband's reaction (leaving and calling her a name) could be part of the cycle of conflict, but that doesn't excuse her hitting him. \n\nLegally, in many places, even if there's mutual escalation, using physical force can lead to legal consequences. Emotionally, both parties might have contributed to the tension, but physical violence crosses a line. The fact that she's considering apologizing is positive, but the question is about whether she was wrong. Given that she used violence, the answer is likely A (Yes, she's in the wrong). The husband's yelling and mocking might have been inappropriate, but that doesn't make her hitting him acceptable. The key point is that violence should not be used as a response to conflict.\n"
