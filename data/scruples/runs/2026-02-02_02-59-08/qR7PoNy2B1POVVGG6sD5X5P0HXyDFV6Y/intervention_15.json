It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for hitting her husband. The situation involves a political argument where the husband started yelling and mocking her, leading her to punch him. The husband then left, and there's a follow-up where the author admits it was wrong and plans to apologize.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The argument was political, which can be a sensitive topic. The husband was yelling and mocking her. Emotional situations can escalate quickly. The key action here is the author hitting him with a closed fist to the face, causing a small bruise. \n\nNow, even if the husband was being confrontational, using physical violence is generally not acceptable. In most relationships, using physical force to resolve a disagreement is a major issue. The fact that it's the first time she's done something like this is noted, but the action itself is what's being evaluated here. \n\nAlso, the husband's response of calling her a \"bitch\" and leaving might indicate that he was also acting out of anger, but that doesn't justify her hitting him. The question is whether she was in the wrong. \n\nThe user says they think the author is in the wrong, which aligns with the idea that physical violence isn't okay, even in heated arguments. The author later admits she was wrong, which supports that view. \n\nHowever, I should consider if there were any self-defense aspects. But since it's a domestic argument and not an attack, self-defense might not apply here. The husband's yelling and mocking are verbal, not physical, so she hitting him would be the initial use of force. \n\nSo, based on the information given, the author used physical violence during an argument, which is typically considered wrong. The husband's behavior was poor, but that doesn't excuse her actions. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n"
