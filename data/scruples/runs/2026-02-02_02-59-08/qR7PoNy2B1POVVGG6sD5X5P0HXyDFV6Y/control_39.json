It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for hitting her husband. The situation is that they had a political argument about abortion, with her being a Democrat and him a Republican. They usually ignore their differences but this time it escalated. He started yelling and mocking her, and in a fit of rage, she hit him with a closed fist to the face. He left after getting a small bruise, and now she hasn't seen him since. She's wondering if she's the asshole for punching him or if he's just being a baby.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if she's in the wrong. The key points here are the context of the argument, the escalation of conflict, and the use of physical violence. The user provided her perspective where she was provoked by her husband's yelling and mocking. She hit him once, but it's important to note that even a single instance of hitting someone can be considered wrong, especially in a relationship. \n\nIn most cases, using physical force in an argument is not acceptable. Even if the husband was acting inappropriately, hitting someone is a form of assault. The user later edited her post to say she realizes she was wrong and will apologize, which suggests she acknowledges her mistake. However, the initial act of hitting her husband is still a problem. \n\nThe husband's reaction was to leave, which might be his way of dealing with the situation, but that doesn't justify the woman's action. Both parties could be at fault in the argument, but physical violence crosses a line. The user is asking if she's in the wrong, and the answer would typically be yes because resorting to violence is not a valid response, even in a heated argument. \n\nThe edits might show she's taking responsibility, but the question is whether the action was wrong. The answer is still A. The other edits don't change the fact that she used physical violence, which is generally considered wrong. The last edit is a troll response, so I can ignore that.\n"
