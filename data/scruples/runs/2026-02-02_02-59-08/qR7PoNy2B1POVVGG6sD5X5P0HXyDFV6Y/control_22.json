It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for hitting her husband. The situation involves a political argument between them, with him yelling and mocking her, and her ending up punching him. She later realizes she was wrong and plans to apologize.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The argument started over politics, specifically abortion, which is a sensitive topic. They usually avoid political discussions, but this time it escalated. The husband started yelling and mocking her, which led her to hit him with a closed fist, causing a small bruise. He then left, and she hasn't seen him since. She's now questioning if she was in the wrong, and she acknowledges her mistake in an edit.\n\nIn terms of domestic violence, physical aggression is a serious issue. Even if the husband was being abusive, hitting him is a criminal act and can be considered assault. The fact that she caused a bruise means there's a physical injury involved. Assault is a legal matter, and regardless of the provocation, using physical force can lead to legal consequences. So from a legal standpoint, she might be in the wrong.\n\nEmotionally and ethically, it's a bit more complex. The husband's behavior of yelling and mocking could be seen as emotional abuse, which is also wrong. However, responding to that with physical violence, even in a moment of rage, is not acceptable. The best course of action in such situations is to de-escalate, seek help, or communicate without violence. Hitting someone, even in anger, crosses a line.\n\nThe user edited later to say she realizes she was wrong and plans to apologize. That shows self-awareness, but it doesn't negate the fact that the action was wrong. The question is whether she is in the wrong, not whether her actions can be forgiven or if she can make amends.\n\nSo putting it all together, even though there was provocation, the physical violence was not justified. The answer is likely that she is in the wrong.\n"
