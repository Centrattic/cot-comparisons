It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who hit their husband was in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation is a political argument between a husband and wife. They usually avoid discussing politics, but this time it escalated. The husband started yelling and mocking her, and in her rage, she hit him with a closed fist. Now, he's left the scene, there's a bruise, and she's wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nLooking at the details, physical violence is a key point. Even if the husband was being abusive or yelling, using a closed fist strike to the face is a clear act of physical aggression. That's a problem because it's a direct and potentially harmful action. Even if there was provocation, hitting someone is never acceptable. \n\nAlso, the husband's reaction of calling her a \"bitch\" and driving off might suggest he's being defensive or retaliatory, but that doesn't justify her hitting him. The user acknowledges in their edit that they realize their mistake and plan to apologize, which shows they see the error in their actions. \n\nIn most cases, any form of physical violence in an argument is considered wrong because it escalates conflict and causes harm. The fact that it's the first time she's done this might be a mitigating factor, but the action itself is still wrong. The husband's yelling is not an excuse for hitting him. Both sides might have contributed to the argument, but the physical act crosses a line.\n\nAdditionally, the context of their political differences doesn't make the violence okay. It's possible the husband was in the wrong by yelling and mocking her, but that doesn't make her hitting him right. The key here is that using physical force to resolve a disagreement is never justified, regardless of the situation.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because she resorted to physical violence, which is not acceptable regardless of the provocation.\n"
