It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post (AITA for hitting my husband) is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the situation: a political argument between spouses leads to the husband yelling and mocking the writer. In a fit of rage, she hits him in the face with a closed fist. He leaves, she hasn't seen him since. She's asking if she's the asshole.\n\nThe key here is physical violence in a relationship. Even in the context of an argument, using physical force is generally considered wrong. Hitting someone, regardless of provocation, is a form of domestic violence. The fact that it was a closed fist to the face adds more severity. \n\nThe writer admits in the edit that she realizes it was wrong and plans to apologize. That shows some self-awareness, but the act itself is still a problem. The husband's behavior (yelling, mocking) is not excusable either, but the question is about the writer's actions. \n\nIn most moral frameworks, resorting to physical violence is a clear wrongdoing. Even mutual escalation doesn't justify it. The fact that it's the first time might mitigate the blame a bit, but it doesn't eliminate it. Relationships should be built on non-violence and respect, so using physical aggression breaks that trust.\n\nAdditionally, the mention of the husband calling her a \"bitch\" and driving off complicates things, but the core issue remains her use of violence. So, the answer is A. The author is in the wrong.\n"
