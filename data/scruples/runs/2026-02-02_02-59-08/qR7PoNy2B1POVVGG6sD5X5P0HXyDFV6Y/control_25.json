It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument. \n\nFirst, the situation: They had a political argument about abortion, which escalated. The husband started yelling and mocking her, leading her to punch him. He left after that, and she hasn't seen him since. She acknowledges she might be in the wrong and plans to apologize.\n\nNow, the key points here. Physical violence in any relationship is generally considered wrong, even if it's in response to someone else's actions. The husband did yell and mock her, which is abusive behavior, but that doesn't justify her hitting him. Both parties are at fault here, but the question is specifically about the author. \n\nThe author admits she acted in a fit of rage and caused a bruise. Even if provoked, using physical force is a form of abuse. So, from a legal and ethical standpoint, her action is wrong. She took things to a level that isn't acceptable. The husband's behavior was also bad, but that doesn't make her action right. \n\nShe also mentions this was the first time this happened, but that doesn't excuse it. The fact that she's planning to apologize is a positive step, but the act itself is still wrong. The answer should be A, yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
