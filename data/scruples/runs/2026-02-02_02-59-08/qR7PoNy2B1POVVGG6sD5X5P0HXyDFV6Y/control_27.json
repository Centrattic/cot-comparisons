It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong after hitting her husband during an argument. The situation involves political differences leading to a yelling argument, mockery, and then a physical altercation.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if hitting someone, even in anger, is generally considered wrong. Physical violence in relationships is typically discouraged because it can escalate conflicts and cause harm. Even if there was provocation, like yelling and mocking, using physical force crosses a line. The author admits she hit him with a closed fist, causing a bruise. That's assault, which is a legal and moral issue.\n\nThe husband's response was to leave, but calling her a name doesn't justify her actions. The author later says she realizes she was wrong and plans to apologize. That shows she acknowledges her mistake, but the act itself is still wrong regardless of subsequent remorse.\n\nAlso, the mention of a troll account and the \"GAMERS RISE UP\" edit seems like a red herring or maybe an attempt to deflect. The main issue is the physical violence. So even if the husband was being an asshole, hitting him isn't acceptable. So the answer should be A.\n"
