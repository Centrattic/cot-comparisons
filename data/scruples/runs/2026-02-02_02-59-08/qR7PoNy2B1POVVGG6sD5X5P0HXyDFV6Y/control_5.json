It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit-style post is the asshole for hitting her husband during an argument. The situation involves a political disagreement between a Democrat and a Republican, which escalated into yelling and mocking. The author then hits her husband with a closed fist, leading to a bruise and him driving off. There are edits where she acknowledges her mistake and plans to apologize, but the main question is whether she was in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the key point is that physical violence is never acceptable in a relationship. Even if there's an argument, hitting someone, spouse or not, is a form of domestic violence and is wrong. The fact that the husband was yelling and mocking might be a contributing factor, but that doesn't justify the physical response. The author admits in an edit that she realizes her mistake, which shows she understands that her action was wrong.\n\nThe argument being about politics, while common, shouldn't lead to physical aggression. The husband's reaction (calling her a \"bitch\" and leaving) is also problematic, but that doesn't make her hitting him okay. Both parties might have acted inappropriately, but the question is specifically about the author's action. The initial question is whether she's the asshole for punching him. Since physical violence is a serious issue, especially in a domestic context, the answer would likely be that she's in the wrong, despite the circumstances.\n\nThe edits also show that she's taking responsibility, but the act itself is the focus here. Even if she plans to apologize, the action of hitting is still wrong. The final edit about \"GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\" is probably a joke or meme, but it doesn't affect the main issue. The troll account pretending to be her husband complicates the situation, but the original question is about her actions. So, overall, the answer is A: Yes, the author is in the wrong for hitting her husband.\n"
