It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument. The situation is that they had a political argument, he started yelling and mocking her, and she hit him with a closed fist, causing a bruise. Now he's left, and she's wondering if she was in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The user is a Democrat, her husband is Republican, and the argument was about abortion. They usually ignore their differences, but this time it escalated. He yelled and mocked her, leading her to hit him. She later apologized, and it was her first time being physical like that. There's also a note that there's a troll pretending to be her husband, but she says that's not her.\n\nNow, the main question is whether she's in the wrong. In most contexts, physical violence is not acceptable, regardless of the provocation. Even if the husband was being abusive or yelling, hitting him is a response that could be considered assault. However, some might argue that in the heat of the moment, especially after being mocked and yelled at, it's a human reaction. But legally and ethically, using physical force to resolve an argument is generally frowned upon. The fact that he was mocking her doesn't justify a punch, though it's not an excuse either.\n\nAlso, the husband's reaction of calling her a name and driving off complicates things, but that doesn't negate the initial act of hitting. The user admits she was wrong and plans to apologize, which shows some self-awareness. But the act itself is problematic. In many cultures and legal systems, mutual violence is still considered wrong, though context matters. The troll edit might be a distraction but doesn't affect the main issue here.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because using physical violence is not appropriate, even if provoked. However, there's a gray area, but the consensus would probably lean towards her being in the wrong.\n"
