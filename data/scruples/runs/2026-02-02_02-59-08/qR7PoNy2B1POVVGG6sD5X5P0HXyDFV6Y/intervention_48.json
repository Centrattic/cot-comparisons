It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. They hit their husband during an argument, which escalated after he started yelling and mocking her. She then hit him with a closed fist, causing a bruise. He left, and she's wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They have political differences, which they usually ignore. This time, the argument got big, he yelled and mocked her. She hit him. She's realizing it's wrong in her edits, but the initial question is whether she's in the wrong. \n\nPhysical violence is generally wrong, even in arguments. Even if provoked, hitting someone is a breach of consent and can be considered assault. The fact that he was mocking her might be a factor, but it doesn't justify hitting him. Emotional responses can be intense, but using physical force is not acceptable. \n\nThe user says they can make up and she plans to apologize. That's good, but doesn't change the initial action. So, the answer would be A, yes, she's in the wrong. Even if the husband was being an asshole, using violence is not acceptable. The edits show she realizes this, but the question is about the situation as presented before the edits. However, the user is asking if she's in the wrong, so the answer is A.\n"
