It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is that she hit her husband during an argument. They had political differences, he started yelling and mocking her, and she hit him with a closed fist. Then he left, and she hasn't seen him since.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether her action was wrong. Physical violence in a relationship is generally considered wrong, regardless of the provocation. Even if he was yelling and being disrespectful, hitting him escalates the conflict and can be considered assault. The fact that he was mocking her doesn't justify a physical response, as verbal insults, while hurtful, shouldn't lead to physical harm.\n\nShe acknowledges in her edit that what she did was wrong and plans to apologize. That shows some self-awareness, but the act itself is still problematic. The edits also mention that this was the first time, but that doesn't excuse it. First-time or not, violence in a relationship is a serious issue.\n\nAlso, the part about the troll account pretending to be her husband might be a red herring. The main issue is her action, not the subsequent online drama. The final edit with \"GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\" is likely an attempt to mock or troll, but that's not relevant to the main question.\n\nSo, considering all that, even if her husband was being an asshole, her response was not appropriate. Therefore, she is in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
