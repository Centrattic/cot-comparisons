It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this question. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument about politics. The situation is that they usually ignore their political differences (she's a Democrat, he's a Republican), but this time it got big. He started yelling and mocking her, and in a fit of rage, she hit him with a closed fist. Then he left, came back with a bruise, called her a name, and drove off. The author is wondering if she's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Physical violence in a relationship is generally not acceptable, regardless of the provocation. Even if the husband was yelling and mocking her, punching him in the face is a violent act. The fact that she admitted it was wrong in her edit shows she realizes that, but the question is whether she is in the wrong. Most people would say yes because hitting someone, even in an argument, is a form of abuse and not a proportionate response. However, some might argue that he provoked her by yelling and mocking, but provocation doesn't excuse physical violence. The key point here is that violence is not the right way to resolve conflicts. So the answer should be A, yes, she's in the wrong. The edits also indicate she plans to apologize, which aligns with acknowledging her mistake.\n"
