It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument. The situation involves a political disagreement leading to yelling and mocking, which then escalates to physical violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The argument started with political differences, which they usually avoid discussing. The husband was yelling and mocking her, which contributed to her hitting him. She admits she acted in a fit of rage and later realizes her mistake, planning to apologize. However, the husband left and she hasn't seen him since.\n\nLegally, hitting someone is considered assault, regardless of the situation. Even if provoked, using physical violence is not acceptable. The fact that it was a closed fist to the face could be seen as intentional harm. The husband's reaction (calling her a name and leaving) doesn't excuse her actions, but his initial behavior might be considered a contributing factor.\n\nIn terms of social norms, using physical violence in a relationship is generally frowned upon. Even in heated arguments, resorting to hitting is seen as crossing a line. The author acknowledges her wrongdoing in an edit, which shows self-awareness, but that doesn't negate the action itself.\n\nThe edits mention a troll account and a final edit with a potentially offensive phrase. These might be red herrings or attempts to add more context, but the core issue remains the use of physical violence. The final edit's language could indicate frustration or trolling, but it's not relevant to the main question unless it's trying to deflect.\n\nConsidering all these points, even if the husband was at fault for yelling and mocking, the author's response of hitting him makes her responsible. The solution would be for both to address their issues without violence, but the immediate answer is that she's in the wrong for using physical aggression.\n"
