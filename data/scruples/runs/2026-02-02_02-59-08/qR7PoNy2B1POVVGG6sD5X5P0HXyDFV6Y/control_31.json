It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple having a political argument, leading to the woman hitting her husband. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. Physical violence in any relationship is generally not acceptable, regardless of the context. Even if the husband was yelling and mocking her, hitting him with a closed fist is a violent act. The fact that she admits she's wrong in her edit shows she's aware of it, but the question is whether she actually is in the wrong.\n\nThe husband's behavior of yelling and mocking is also problematic. However, that doesn't justify her hitting him. Both sides have issues here, but the use of physical violence is a clear violation. The outcome is a bruise and him driving off, which could be dangerous if he was upset.\n\nThe edits mention that she plans to apologize, which is a good step. But the initial act of hitting someone, even in anger, is a problem. The title \"Am I the Asshole\" suggests she's questioning her actions, which is a positive sign of self-reflection.\n\nThe troll account edit is probably a red herring but shows the situation might have gotten more complicated. The final edit with \"GAMERS RISE UP\" seems like a joke or a meme tag, which might indicate the user isn't entirely serious, but the main question remains about her action.\n\nIn conclusion, even if there was provocation, using physical violence is not acceptable. So the answer is A, she is in the wrong.\n"
