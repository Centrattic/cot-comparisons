It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for hitting her husband during a political argument. The scenario is that they usually avoid political discussions, but this time it escalated. The husband started yelling and mocking her, and in a rage, she hit him with a closed fist. Now he's left, and she's wondering if she was wrong.\n\nFirst, physical violence in a relationship is generally not acceptable. Even if there's an argument, hitting someone is a form of abuse. The user acknowledges that she'll apologize, but that doesn't change the fact that the action itself is wrong. The husband's behavior (yelling and mocking) is disrespectful, but that doesn't justify her hitting him. People should resolve conflicts without physical harm. Also, the edit mentions that someone is impersonating her husband, but that's a separate issue. The main question is about her actions. So, the answer is A.\n"
