It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves an argument between a husband and wife about politics, leading to the wife hitting her husband. The key points here are the use of physical violence, even if it was in response to yelling and mocking.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the immediate action: hitting someone, even in anger, is generally considered a form of assault. In most contexts, using a closed fist to hit another person, especially in the face, is a clear act of physical aggression. The fact that it's between spouses adds another layer, but the law typically treats domestic violence seriously regardless of the relationship.\n\nThe husband's behavior\u2014yelling and mocking\u2014might be provocation, but provocation doesn't justify a physical response. The user edited to say they realize they were wrong and plan to apologize, which is good, but the initial action still needs to be evaluated. In many places, mutual combat or self-defense could be factors, but since the husband was mocking and yelling, it's unclear if the wife's action was self-defense. Also, the husband left afterward, so there's no immediate retaliation.\n\nThe edits also mention a troll account and a final edit that seems out of place, which might be distractions but don't affect the core issue. The key is whether hitting is acceptable. Even in heated arguments, physical violence is generally not acceptable. So the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
