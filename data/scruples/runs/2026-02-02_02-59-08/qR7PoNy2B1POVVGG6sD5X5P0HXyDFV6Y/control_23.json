It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that they had a political argument with their husband, he started yelling and mocking her, and she hit him with a closed fist. Then he left and she hasn't seen him since.\n\nFirst, physical violence is generally a big issue. Even if there was provocation, hitting someone can lead to serious consequences. The fact that she used a closed fist to hit his face might result in injury, which it did\u2014he had a bruise. So from a legal standpoint, that's assault. But the question is more about moral wrong, not legal.\n\nIn relationships, physical violence is a deal-breaker for many people. It's not acceptable regardless of the reason. Even if he was being rude, yelling, and mocking, responding with physical aggression is not appropriate. There's also the aspect of mutual respect and communication. They usually ignore political differences, but this time it escalated. She admits it was her first time doing something like this and says she'll apologize. But she's asking if she's the asshole.\n\nHe called her a \"bitch\" and drove off, but that doesn't justify her hitting him. Name-calling can be hurtful, but it doesn't give someone the right to hit back. The husband's response might not justify her actions either. The key point here is that physical violence is a clear wrong action, regardless of the context. Even if there was an argument, hitting is not acceptable. So the author is in the wrong here. Her husband's behavior was inconsiderate, but she should have found a non-violent way to handle the situation. The edit where she realizes she was wrong supports that she knows it's not okay. So the answer is A.\n"
