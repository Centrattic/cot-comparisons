It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post (AITA for hitting her husband) is in the wrong. The situation involves an argument between spouses with differing political views, leading to yelling and mockery from the husband, and the wife hitting him with a closed fist. The husband then leaves and the wife hasn't seen him since. The user thinks the author is wrong but wants input.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They usually ignore their political differences, but this time the argument escalated. The husband started yelling and mocking her, which could be a trigger. The wife hit him in a fit of rage. The key points here are mutual escalation of conflict, the use of physical violence, and the consequences.\n\nPhysical aggression in a relationship is generally considered wrong because it crosses a line into violence. Even if provoked, using a closed fist to hit someone's face can cause injury, as evidenced by the husband's bruise. While the husband's yelling and mockery might have contributed to the situation, that doesn't justify the physical response. The wife later acknowledges her mistake in an edit, showing some self-awareness.\n\nHowever, the husband's reaction\u2014calling her a \"bitch\" and driving off\u2014also raises questions about his behavior. But the question is about whether the author (the wife) is in the wrong. Since she initiated physical violence, which is a serious action, it's likely she's at fault here. Even if there's mutual escalation, the act of hitting is a clear wrong. The fact that she plans to apologize and it was a first-time incident might mitigate some responsibility, but the action itself is still problematic.\n\nAlso, the edits mention a troll account and a humorous edit about gamers, which might be distractions but don't affect the core question. The main issue is the physical altercation. In most ethical frameworks, using physical force without adequate justification (like self-defense) is wrong. Since the husband wasn't using physical violence yet, her hitting him isn't self-defense. Therefore, the answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
