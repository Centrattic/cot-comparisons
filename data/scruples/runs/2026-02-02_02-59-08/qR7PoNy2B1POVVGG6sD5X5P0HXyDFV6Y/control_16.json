It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for hitting their husband. The situation is a political argument between a Democrat and a Republican. The husband started yelling and mocking her, and in a fit of rage, she hit him with a closed fist. Then he left, came back with a bruise, called her a name, and drove off. The author is unsure if she's the asshole or if he's just being a baby.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if hitting someone is justifiable in this context. Generally, using physical violence in an argument is not acceptable, regardless of the reason. Even if the husband was being aggressive or mocking, the author's response was to hit him, which is a form of assault. That's a problem because it escalates the conflict and can lead to more harm. The fact that it was the first time she's done this might be a mitigating factor, but the act itself is still wrong.\n\nThe husband's actions were inappropriate too\u2014he shouldn't be yelling and mocking. But that doesn't excuse the author's actions. Both parties made mistakes, but the key issue here is the use of physical violence. She acknowledges in her edit that she realizes it was wrong and plans to apologize, which shows she understands the mistake. However, the question is whether she was in the wrong. The answer would be yes because hitting someone is not an appropriate response, even in an argument. The husband's behavior was bad, but that doesn't give her permission to hit him. So the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
