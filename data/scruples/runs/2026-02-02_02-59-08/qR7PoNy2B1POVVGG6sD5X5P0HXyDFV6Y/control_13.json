It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this story is in the wrong. The situation is that she and her husband had a political argument, he yelled and mocked her, and she hit him in the face with a closed fist. Now he's left, and she's asking if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. Physical violence in a relationship is a serious issue. Even if the husband was being aggressive or yelling, hitting him back escalates the situation. Using a closed fist to the face can cause injury, and she admitted there was a bruise. So, her action resulted in harm, even if it was in response to his behavior.\n\nNow, the husband's actions: he was yelling and mocking. While that's not okay, verbal abuse can be a trigger for physical responses. But hitting someone is a criminal act in many places, regardless of the reason. The fact that she used physical violence means she crossed a line. \n\nThe edits show she realizes she was wrong and plans to apologize, which is a good step. However, the initial act of hitting is still problematic. Even if it's the first time, the act itself is what's being judged here. The question is about whether she's in the wrong, not about whether she's a bad person overall. \n\nAnother angle is mutual responsibility. The husband's behavior contributed to the argument, but that doesn't justify her hitting him. Both should manage conflicts without violence. So, while he may have been at fault for yelling, her response isn't excusable. \n\nAlso, the part where he called her a \"bitch\" and left might indicate his own issues, but again, that doesn't make her hitting him acceptable. The key point is that using physical force in a disagreement is a breach, regardless of the provocation. \n\nThe user wants a clear answer, A for yes, she's in the wrong, B for no. Based on the analysis, the answer should be A. Even if the husband provoked her, hitting is a clear wrongdoings.\n"
