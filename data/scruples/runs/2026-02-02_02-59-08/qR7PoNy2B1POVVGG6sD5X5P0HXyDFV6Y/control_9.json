It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for hitting their husband during an argument. The situation involves a political disagreement that escalated into yelling and physical violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple usually ignores their political differences, but this argument was big. The husband started yelling and mocking the author, which led her to hit him with a closed fist. He then left, and she hasn't seen him since. She acknowledges her mistake in an edit, saying she'll apologize and that it was the first time. \n\nNow, the main question is about whether she's in the wrong. In many places, using physical force in a relationship is considered a form of domestic violence, regardless of the provocation. Even if the husband was yelling and being disrespectful, hitting him is a criminal act. The fact that she admitted her mistake in the edit shows awareness that she did something wrong. \n\nAlso, the husband's reaction of calling her a \"bitch\" and driving off might indicate his own wrongdoing, but that doesn't justify her hitting him. The legal and ethical standards here are clear: violence is not acceptable. Even in self-defense, which isn't claimed here, the response would need to be proportionate. Hitting someone in the face with a closed fist is excessive and intentional, so it's not justified by the situation described.\n\nMoreover, the author's own edit 2 where she realizes her mistake and plans to apologize reinforces that her actions were wrong. The initial question in the \"AITA\" format (Am I the Asshole) usually leads to the answer being that the person is the asshole if they admit fault, which they do here. \n\nThe other edits about a fake account and a troll might be distractions, but the core of the issue is her physical aggression. The final \"GAMERS RISE UP\" edit seems like a joke and not relevant to the actual situation. \n\nSo putting it all together, the answer is A because the author used physical violence, which is wrong regardless of the circumstances. Even if the husband provoked her, hitting him isn't acceptable and constitutes domestic violence. The author recognizing her mistake in the edit supports that she was in the wrong.\n"
