It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the person who hit their husband is in the wrong. The situation involves an argument about politics, leading to yelling and mockery from the husband, which caused the wife to hit him. She then received a bruise, and he left. She later apologized in an edit.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. Physical violence is generally not acceptable, regardless of the situation. Even if there was provocation, hitting someone is a form of assault. The husband's yelling and mocking might be inconsiderate, but that doesn't justify a physical response. The wife acknowledges she's wrong in the edit, which shows self-awareness. However, the act itself is a problem. In most contexts, using physical force in a domestic dispute is considered wrong. The fact that it's the first time and she plans to apologize might mitigate some blame, but the action itself is still on her. So, the answer is likely A.\n"
