It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for hitting their husband during an argument. The situation involves political differences leading to a yelling and mocking from the husband, which then resulted in the wife hitting him. \n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The argument started over politics, specifically abortion. They usually ignore their differences, but this argument escalated. The husband started yelling and mocking her. In a rage, she hit him with a closed fist, causing a bruise. He left afterward, and now she's questioning if she's the asshole.\n\nLegally, using physical violence in a relationship is generally not acceptable, regardless of provocation. Even if the husband was being verbally abusive, hitting him could be considered assault. The wife acknowledges that what she did was wrong in her edit, which suggests she realizes the mistake. However, the initial question is whether she's in the wrong. \n\nEmotionally, the situation is tense. Verbal abuse can be very stressful, but that doesn't justify physical retaliation. The husband's actions (yelling, mocking) were inappropriate too, but physical violence is a step further. The question is about who is in the wrong. \n\nIn terms of social norms and relationship advice, it's often advised to avoid physical violence altogether. Even in heated arguments, hitting someone can lead to more harm and escalate the conflict. The fact that the wife was in a fit of rage might be seen as a mitigating factor, but it doesn't excuse the action. \n\nThe user's edit where she says she realizes it was wrong and plans to apologize shows remorse. But the original question is about whether she's in the wrong. Most perspectives would agree that using physical violence is wrong, even if provoked. The husband's behavior was also inconsiderate, but the wife's action crosses a line that's more socially and legally unacceptable. \n\nSo, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong). Even if both parties acted poorly, the physical hit is a clear violation that makes her the asshole in this scenario.\n"
