It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for hitting their husband during an argument. The situation involves political differences leading to an argument, with the husband yelling and mocking, then the author hitting him with a closed fist. The husband left after a few hours, and the author is now asking if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They usually ignore political differences, but this time it escalated. The husband's behavior included yelling and mocking, which could be seen as disrespectful. However, the author responded with a physical assault\u2014hitting the husband in the face. Even if provoked, using physical violence is generally not acceptable, especially in a relationship. \n\nThe author acknowledges their mistake in an edit, saying they'll apologize and that it was the first time. That shows some self-awareness. But the question is whether they're in the wrong. In most cases, physical violence is not justified regardless of the provocation. Even if the husband was being an asshole, hitting someone is a form of domestic violence, which is a serious issue. \n\nThe husband's response\u2014calling them a \"bitch\" and driving off\u2014also isn't great, but that doesn't make the author's action okay. The key point here is the use of physical force. Even if both parties are at fault in the argument, the author's action crosses a line into violence, which is a significant problem. \n\nAdditionally, the edit about a troll account and the last edit with a racial slur might be red herrings or attempts to deflect, but they don't change the main issue of the physical assault. The author's responsibility for the punch remains. \n\nSo, putting it all together, even though the husband's behavior was poor, the author's use of physical violence is the main issue here. Therefore, the answer is A\u2014yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
