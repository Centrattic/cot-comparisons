It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument. The situation involves political differences leading to a heated argument where the husband yells and mocks her, and she then hits him with a closed fist. After that, he leaves, and now she's wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. Physical violence in a relationship is generally not acceptable, regardless of the provocation. The article mentions that the argument was about politics, which is a common source of conflict, but escalating to physical assault crosses a line. The user acknowledges that she hit him with a closed fist, which can be considered assault. Even if the husband was yelling and mocking, the appropriate response isn't to hit. There's also a bruise mentioned, so there was some injury.\n\nThe user's edits show she later realizes her mistake and plans to apologize. However, the initial question is whether she was in the wrong. The first edit about a troll account is probably to prevent harassment but doesn't affect the main issue. The second edit admits fault, which suggests the answer should be A (yes, she's in the wrong). \n\nEven if the husband's behavior was rude, hitting someone is not a justified response. The law and societal norms typically view physical assault as wrong unless in self-defense, which doesn't seem to be the case here. The husband's reaction of driving off might be irresponsible, but that doesn't justify her action. The user's final edit about \"GAMERS RISE UP\" seems out of place, possibly a joke or typo, but doesn't change the analysis.\n\nSo, the conclusion is that the author is in the wrong for using physical violence, regardless of the argument's content. Answer A.\n"
