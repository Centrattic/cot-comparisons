It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author of this question is in the wrong for hitting their husband. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe user is a woman who had an argument with her husband about politics, specifically abortion. They have different political views\u2014she's a Democrat, he's a Republican. They usually ignore their differences, but this time the argument escalated. He started yelling and mocking her, and in a fit of rage, she hit him with a closed fist to the face. He left and came back with a small bruise, then called her a \"bitch\" and drove off. She hasn't seen him since and is asking if she's the asshole for punching him or if he's being a baby.\n\nFirst, the key issue here is the use of physical violence. Hitting someone, even in a heated argument, is a form of physical aggression, which is generally considered wrong in relationships. Even if there was provocation, like yelling or mocking, using a closed fist to hit the face is a clear act of physical assault. That's a legal issue in many places, as assault can be a criminal offense, regardless of the reason.\n\nThe husband's response was to call her a name and leave. While calling someone a \"bitch\" is disrespectful and hurtful, it's not physical violence. However, the fact that he left the situation might be an attempt to de-escalate, which is a reasonable response. But his actions don't justify her hitting him.\n\nThe user later edited the post to say she realizes she was wrong and plans to apologize, but the initial act was still a choice to use physical violence. The fact that it's the first time and they might reconcile doesn't negate the wrongness of the action. It's important to consider the intent and the consequences. In a relationship, violence should never be a reaction, no matter how intense the disagreement.\n\nAlso, the mention of a troll account pretending to be her husband adds some complexity, but that doesn't change the fact that she admitted to hitting him. The troll might be trying to stir up trouble, but the original question is about her actions.\n\nIn terms of social norms, using physical force in an argument is widely seen as unacceptable. Even in self-defense, it's a different scenario, but here, she's the one who initiated the physical contact. The husband's yelling and mocking, while hurtful, don't give her the right to hit him. Relationships should be built on communication and mutual respect, not physical aggression.\n\nThe user's edit where she acknowledges her mistake is a positive step, but the question is whether she was in the wrong in the first place. The answer would still be yes because the act of hitting someone is inherently wrong, regardless of the circumstances. The fact that she's going to apologize is a separate matter from whether the action itself was wrong.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the answer should be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
