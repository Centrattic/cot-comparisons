It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument. The situation involves a political disagreement that escalated into yelling and mockery, leading to a physical altercation. The author hit her husband with a closed fist, causing a small bruise. He then left, and she's seeking validation on whether she was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. Physical violence in a relationship is generally not acceptable, regardless of the provocation. Even if the husband was yelling and mocking her, hitting him is a form of assault. The author acknowledges this in her edit, stating she realizes it was wrong and plans to apologize. However, the initial question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nThe husband's behavior (yelling and mocking) is also problematic, but that doesn't justify the use of physical force. The fact that she used a closed fist hit to the face suggests intentional harm, which is a clear violation of non-violence in a relationship. Even if both parties acted poorly, the physical act crosses a significant line. \n\nAdditionally, the author's mention of the husband calling her a \"bitch\" after the hit and driving off might indicate his own inappropriate reaction, but that doesn't negate her responsibility for the violence. The edit about realizing her mistake is important, as it shows self-awareness, but the action itself is where the wrong occurs.\n\nThe presence of trolls and the edit about \"GAMERS RISE UP\" might be distractions, but the core issue remains her use of violence. In most ethical and legal frameworks, using physical force against a partner is considered wrong, regardless of the reason. So, while the husband's behavior is at fault, the author's actions make her responsible for the escalation into physical violence. Therefore, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
