It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong after hitting their husband during an argument. The story says they had a political disagreement, which eventually escalated into the husband yelling and mocking her. In a fit of rage, she hit him with a closed fist to the face, causing a small bruise. Then he left and didn't come back for a few hours.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Political arguments can be intense, but using physical violence is a big deal. Even if the husband was being abusive by yelling and mocking, hitting someone in the face is not acceptable. The key point here is that physical aggression is a response to emotional conflict, and that's generally not justified. \n\nThe user also mentions the husband called her a \"bitch\" and drove off. But that's after the hit. The question is about who is in the wrong. The author admits in the first edit that they realize their mistake and plan to apologize, which shows they acknowledge it was wrong. \n\nEven though the husband's behavior was bad, the author's action of hitting him with a closed fist leading to a bruise is a criminal act in many places. So, regardless of the provocation, using violence is a clear error. The husband's response might be justified if he was being assaulted, but the original action of the author is what's under scrutiny. \n\nAlso, the second edit shows the author is taking responsibility, which implies they see their mistake. The other responses from the community (the edits) might be trying to resolve the situation, but the initial act of hitting is still wrong. \n\nSo, the answer should be A. The author is in the wrong because using physical violence is not acceptable even in heated arguments. The husband's yelling and mocking are not excuses for hitting someone.\n"
