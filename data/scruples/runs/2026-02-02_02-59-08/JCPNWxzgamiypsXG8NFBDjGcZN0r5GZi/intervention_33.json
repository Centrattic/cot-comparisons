Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author left their car parked at their parents' house while they were in Germany for three months. A 16-year-old neighbor kid hit the car, causing $1,000 in damage. The kid and his mom went to the parents' house, and the parents told them not to worry about it, even though the kid offered to pay. Now the author is upset because they weren't informed and there's no compensation. The neighbors and parents think the author is overreacting and the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, if someone's property is damaged, the responsible party is usually liable for damages. The kid is 16, so maybe his parents are legally responsible since he's a minor. But the parents might be arguing that the damage was minor or that the author's parents waved the claim. However, the author's parents might not have the legal authority to waive the claim on the author's behalf. The owner of the car (the author) would have the right to seek compensation. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong legally.\n\nThen there's the moral aspect. The kid was at fault, and even though he apologized, the financial burden is on the author. The author's parents might have resolved it without informing the author, which is problematic because the author is the one who has to deal with the repair costs. The neighbors and parents might think it's a minor issue, but $1,000 is a significant amount, and the author isn't at fault. The neighbors might be in the wrong for not informing the author or handling the situation properly.\n\nAlso, the parents might have acted out of good intentions, thinking it's easier to just let it go. But they shouldn't make decisions that affect the author's property and finances without consulting them. The author has a right to know about the damage and to seek reimbursement if it's their legal right.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong because the damage was caused by someone else, and the responsible parties (the kid and his parents) should be liable for the damages. The author's parents might have overstepped by not informing the author or allowing compensation. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
