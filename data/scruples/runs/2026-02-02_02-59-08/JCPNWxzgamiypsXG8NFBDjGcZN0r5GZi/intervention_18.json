Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in the situation described. The scenario involves a neighbor kid hitting their parked car while they were away, with no notification and the author now seeking reimbursement.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. Generally, when someone damages another person's property, they are responsible for the damages. The kid is 16, so his parents might have legal responsibility as guardians. The author's parents were present and initially told the kid's family not to worry about it, but the author argues they didn't have the authority to waive their own right to compensation.\n\nThen there's the social aspect. The author's parents and others think the author is overreacting. But the author is upset because they were not informed and now have to pay for repairs. The key issue here is whether the author is justified in seeking reimbursement after their parents forgave the debt. \n\nIn some jurisdictions, if the owner of the car (the author) wasn't present, the legal guardians or immediate family might have the authority to make decisions on their behalf. However, if the author wasn't informed and their parents didn't have the right to forgive the debt, then the author could have a valid claim. \n\nBut here's the catch: if the parents explicitly told the kid's family not to worry about it, then the author might be seen as not holding the other party accountable, especially if they later change their stance. The author's parents might have taken responsibility, so the author's insistence on reimbursement could come off as double-dipping or going back on an agreement made in their absence.\n\nOn the other hand, the author wasn't consulted, and their parents might have acted without their consent. The financial burden is on the author now, which is unfair if the parents didn't have the right to make that decision. However, in many cases, family members can make such decisions, especially if the car is registered under the author's name. \n\nI think the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because the parents might not have the legal authority to forgive the debt on their behalf. But the situation is tricky because the parents did handle it, and the author is now challenging their decision. It's a mix of legal responsibility and family dynamics. But since the author wasn't informed, they have a valid reason to seek compensation, making them not the asshole. However, if the parents had the authority, then the author might be in the wrong for going back on the initial agreement. It's a bit ambiguous, but leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because they weren't part of the initial decision. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
