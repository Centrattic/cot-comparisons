Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that their neighbor's kid hit their car while they were away and didn't get reimbursed. The parents told them not to worry about it, but the author is upset because they weren't informed and have to pay for the damages.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the key points. The car was damaged by a 16-year-old. The parents were present when the kid apologized and offered to pay, but the parents were against involving the police or a claim. The author's parents dismissed it, but now the author feels wronged because he wasn't told and has to cover the costs.\n\nSo, legally, a 16-year-old might be considered a minor, so the responsibility could fall on the parents. If the kid admitted fault and offered to pay, but the parents refused to pay, then maybe the parents are at fault here. However, the author's parents didn't inform him, which complicates things.\n\nThe author is upset about not being informed. If the parents had told him earlier, he could have handled it. But since he was abroad, maybe there's a communication issue. Also, the parents might have thought it was resolved with an apology.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the author isn't the one who hit the car. The kid and his parents didn't inform the owner (the author) and dismissed the issue. The author is seeking reimbursement, which is reasonable. However, the parents might feel that since their parents told them not to worry, the author is overreacting now. But the author didn't know about the damage until returning.\n\nLegally, the person who caused the damage is responsible, even if they're a minor. The parents might be liable for their child's actions. So if the parents said not to worry, but the damage was done, the author is justified in seeking compensation. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong; the kid and his parents are. So answer B.\n"
