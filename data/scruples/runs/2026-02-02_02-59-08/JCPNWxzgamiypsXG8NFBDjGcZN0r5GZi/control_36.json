Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's kid hit their parked car while they were abroad, causing $1,000 in damage. The kid and his parents went to the author's parents, who told them not to worry about it. Now the author is upset because they weren't informed and there's no compensation. They're being told they're the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the legal and social aspects. Legally, if someone causes damage to your property, they are typically responsible for covering the costs. The fact that the kid is a minor might complicate things, but his parents might be liable. The parents might have offered to pay but the author's parents dismissed it. Socially, the neighbors might have thought it was resolved, but the author wasn't informed. The author is now seeking compensation after returning, which others see as overreacting.\n\nBut from a fairness perspective, the author didn't have a chance to decide how to handle it. Their parents might have resolved it without consulting them, leading to the author's unexpected financial burden. The kid did apologize and offer to pay, but the author's parents didn't pass that info along. So the author's anger is about not being informed and not getting compensation, which is understandable.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Legally, they might not be. But socially, if the neighbors thought it was resolved, the author's sudden demand might come off as unexpected. However, the author's parents didn't inform them, which is part of the issue. The answer likely leans towards the author not being in the wrong, but maybe there's nuance. Wait, the kid's parents were upset about being asked to pay, but the author's parents said not to worry. So the author's parents might have already let it go. But the author didn't have a say. So maybe the author is right to seek reimbursement because they weren't involved in that decision. \n\nSo the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because the responsibility for the damage lies with the kid, and the author's parents shouldn't have dismissed the issue without consulting the car owner.\n"
