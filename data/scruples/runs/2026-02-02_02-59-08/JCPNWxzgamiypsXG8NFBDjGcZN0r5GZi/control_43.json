Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. Let me start by reading the details carefully.\n\nSo, the author left their car parked at their parents' house while they were in Germany for three months. A neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit the car. The kid and his mom went to the parents' house, and the parents told them not to worry about it. The kid apologized and offered to pay, but the parents dismissed the issue. When the author returns, they find out about the $1,000 damage and are upset because they weren't informed and there's no compensation. The parents and others think the author is overreacting and being the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is at fault. The key points here are about responsibility and communication. The parents handled the situation by letting the kid off the hook, but the author isn't aware until they return. The author is now asking for reimbursement, which people are saying is unreasonable.\n\nThe kid is a minor (16 years old), so legally, the responsibility might fall on the parents. However, in this case, the kid offered to pay, but the parents didn't make him. The parents might have thought they were being kind by not making a big deal, but that's leaving the author out of the loop.\n\nThe author's parents didn't inform them about the incident. That's a problem. The author is the rightful owner of the car, so they should be involved in decisions about compensation. By not telling the author, the parents may have acted without considering their responsibility to the owner. The author is upset about not being informed and having to pay out of pocket.\n\nFrom a legal perspective, if the parents dismissed the claim, maybe they had the authority to do so? But in reality, the author is the owner, so the parents might not have the right to waive the claim on their behalf. However, the parents had the car in their care, so maybe they thought they were handling it. But that's not necessarily correct. The author is the one who owns the car and has to bear the financial burden.\n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong. They are upset because they were kept in the dark and expected to cover the costs. The kid was at fault for causing the damage and not informing the owner. The parents' decision to not inform the author and let the kid off without compensation is where the fault lies. The author is justified in seeking reimbursement for the damage done to their property.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
