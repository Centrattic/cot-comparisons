Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit the author's car while the author was away. The parents were there and met the kid and his parents. The kid apologized and offered to pay, but the author's parents told them not to worry about it. Now the author is upset because he wasn't told and there's no compensation. He's being told he's overreacting and that he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, if someone damages your property, they're legally responsible. But since the parents were present, maybe they handled it. The kid is a minor, so his parents might be liable. But if the parents were told and agreed to let it go, does that absolve them? Maybe not if they didn't actually settle the matter properly. The author's parents might have said not to worry, but maybe they didn't have the authority to forgive the debt, especially since the car belongs to the author. So legally, the author might have a right to seek compensation.\n\nThen there's the social aspect. The parents might have wanted to avoid conflict, but the author is the one who ends up with the financial loss. The neighbors might think they resolved it, but the author wasn't consulted. The kid did apologize and offer to pay, so maybe the author's parents should have informed him and let him decide. But since the author is the owner, the parents shouldn't have dismissed it without his input. So the author isn't wrong for wanting reimbursement. The fact that he wasn't informed is a problem because he's the one who has to pay for the repairs.\n\nAlso, the kid not informing the owner directly is an issue. Even if the parents were involved, the owner should be made aware. The author's parents might have been trying to be nice, but they didn't own the car, so they can't make decisions about compensation. So the author isn't the asshole here. The neighbors should have contacted him or let the parents know he should be informed. Therefore, the answer is B (author is not in the wrong).\n"
