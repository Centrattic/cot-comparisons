Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit the author's parked car while the author was away in Germany. The kid's parents were present, and they were told not to worry about it. Now the author is upset because he wasn't informed and there's no compensation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and social aspects. Legally, when someone damages another person's property, they're usually responsible for covering the costs. The kid is a minor, so his parents would be responsible. However, the parents were given the chance to pay but were told not to worry. The author's parents might have decided to waive the damages, but the author is now being blamed for expecting reimbursement.\n\nSocially, if the parents of the kid were already informed and apologized, maybe there's an expectation that the matter is resolved. However, the author didn't know about the damage until returning, which is a key point. The author is being told he's the asshole for seeking reimbursement, but that could be because the situation was already addressed by the parents present at the time.\n\nBut wait, the author wasn't there. His parents handled it, and they said not to worry. So maybe the author is in the wrong for expecting compensation since the immediate parties handled it. However, the author's parents might have made that decision without consulting him, which could be a problem. The author's right to know about the damage exists, but the legal responsibility was transferred to the parents, who chose to let it go.\n\nAnother angle: Did the parents have the authority to waive compensation on his behalf? If the car is the author's, then his parents might not have the right to decide that. But if the parents were acting as guardians or with the car stored at their house, maybe they have some say. This is a bit unclear.\n\nIn terms of community opinion, the author is frustrated and feels wronged. But if the parents at the scene resolved it, others might see the author as overstepping by now seeking payment later. However, the author's rights as the car owner could be in question here. The key is whether the parents had the right to waive the claim without consulting him.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be entirely in the wrong. The parents who were present might have resolved it without his consent, and he's now facing the financial burden. The kid's family could be responsible, but the author's own parents' actions complicate things. The author's reaction is about being informed and compensated, which is valid. But if the initial parties handled it, maybe he's not the asshole. Alternatively, if the parents shouldn't have let it go without his input, he's right to ask. This is a bit tricky, but leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because the parents' decision might not have been valid without his consent.\n"
