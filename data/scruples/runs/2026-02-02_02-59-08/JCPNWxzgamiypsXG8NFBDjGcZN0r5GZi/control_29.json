Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's kid hit their parked car while they were abroad. The parents were there and spoke to the kid and his mom, who offered to pay. The parents said not to worry about it, but now the car owner is upset because he wasn't informed and isn't getting compensation.\n\nSo the main points are: The car was damaged, the kid admitted fault, offered to pay, but the parents (the car's owner's parents) declined. The author is upset because he didn't know and feels he should be compensated. The question is whether he's in the wrong for expecting reimbursement.\n\nFirst, legal responsibility. If the kid is at fault, the parents, as guardians, are typically liable for their minor child's actions. In many places, when a minor causes damage, the parents are responsible. So the kid's parents should be the ones liable, not the kid directly. But in this case, the kid offered to pay, but the car owner's parents accepted the apology and said it's okay. The car owner wasn't even there, so his parents made the decision not to pursue compensation.\n\nBut the car owner is the one who owns the car. Even though his parents were present, they aren't the ones who own the car. The parents might have acted without the owner's consent. Legally, if the car belongs to the author, then the decision about compensation should be his. The parents might have overstepped by not informing him and dismissing the payment.\n\nHowever, from a social standpoint, maybe there's an unspoken agreement in the community to let minor incidents go, especially if the parents of the at-fault party are cooperative. The kid apologized, and the parents of the car owner might have considered it resolved. The author is now upset because he's facing the financial burden.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he's not responsible for the accident. The kid caused the damage and should be held accountable. The parents' decision not to pursue compensation doesn't negate the fact that the author is out $1,000. He's justified in seeking reimbursement because it's his property. The parents might have made a unilateral decision without considering his wishes. So, the author isn't in the wrong. The kid's parents should have covered the cost, and the author's parents shouldn't have dismissed the matter without consulting him.\n\nBut maybe there's more. Did the author inform his parents that he wanted to be kept in the loop about car issues? If he didn't, maybe his parents assumed he wouldn't care. But that's a stretch. The car is his, so the parents' handling without his knowledge could be an issue. However, the main issue is the liability of the kid's parents. The author is right to seek compensation, so the answer is B.\n"
