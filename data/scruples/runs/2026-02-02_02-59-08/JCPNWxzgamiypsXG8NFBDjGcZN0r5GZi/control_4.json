Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that a neighbor's kid hit their parked car while they were abroad. The parents were present and the kid apologized but the parents told them not to worry about it. Now the author is upset because they weren't informed and have to pay for repairs.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, if someone damages another's property, they are responsible for damages. Since the kid is a minor, his parents would be liable. The parents here didn't contact the car owner and instead told their kid to not worry about it. The author is now seeking reimbursement.\n\nThen there's the social aspect. The parents might have been trying to avoid conflict, but the author is being told they're overreacting. But the author is the one who had their property damaged without being informed. They're being asked to accept no compensation, which might be unfair.\n\nThe kid did apologize and offered to pay, but the parents dismissed it. The author has a right to be compensated for their loss. The fact that they were away might mean they couldn't handle it immediately, but that doesn't negate their right to reimbursement. The parents' decision not to inform them is part of the issue here.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They're standing up for their rights. The neighbors and their parents are at fault for not handling the situation properly. The answer should be B.\n"
