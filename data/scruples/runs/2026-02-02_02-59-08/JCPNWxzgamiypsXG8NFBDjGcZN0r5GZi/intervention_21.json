Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor kid hit their parked car when they were away, and now the author is upset about not being reimbursed. The main points here are: the author was abroad, the kid and his parents approached the author's parents, the parents told them not to worry, and now the author is angry because he had to pay for the damages.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, if someone damages another person's property, they are legally responsible for covering the costs. The kid is 16, so his parents might share that responsibility. But since the parents approached the author's parents and were told not to worry, maybe the author's parents let it slide. \n\nHowever, the key issue is that the author wasn't informed. The car is the author's property, so they have the right to know about the damage and to seek compensation. Even if the parents accepted the apology, the owner should be informed. The parents might have the authority to handle matters for their child, but the car owner's rights are separate. \n\nThe author's frustration is understandable. They had to pay out of pocket for something they didn't cause. The neighbors didn't inform them, and the parents didn't mention it. The author is not wrong for seeking reimbursement. The neighbors, especially the kid and his parents, should take responsibility. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author is standing up for their property rights, which is justified. The neighbors didn't inform them, which is a problem. The parents' decision to let it go doesn't absolve the kid of responsibility. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. They have a right to be informed and seek compensation for their damages.\n"
