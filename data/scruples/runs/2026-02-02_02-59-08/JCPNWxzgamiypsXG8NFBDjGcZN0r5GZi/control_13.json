Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit their parked car while they were away. The parents were there and interacted with the neighbor's family. The parents were told not to worry about it, but now the author is upset because they had to pay $1,000 for repairs.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The kid caused damage intentionally or accidentally? It says he backed up into the car, so probably accidentally. The parents of the kid were present when the incident happened. They were told by the author's parents not to worry, but the author wasn't informed. The question is about whether the author is wrong for seeking reimbursement now.\n\nLegally, if a minor causes damage, their parents might be responsible. But the author's parents might have already resolved it by saying not to worry. Did the author's parents have the authority to dismiss the claim? The car is the author's, so maybe the parents shouldn't have made that decision without consulting them. \n\nAlso, the neighbor's family might have thought the matter was settled. But the author wasn't informed, so they're now out of pocket. The author is upset because they're the ones who have to pay. From an ethical standpoint, the kid caused the damage, so the family should compensate the owner. However, if the author's parents already resolved it, maybe the author is overstepping now by coming back and demanding money.\n\nBut the author's parents might have been overstepping by making that decision for their child. The car belongs to the author, so the parents might not have the right to forgive the debt without the owner's consent. So maybe the author is right to be upset because their parents didn't have the authority to dismiss the claim.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the kid's parents should have informed the author when he returned. Not informing him could be a mistake. However, if the author's parents said it's okay, maybe the neighbor family isn't in the wrong. But the author is the one who's out of pocket. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nLegally, the author might have a case if the damage wasn't properly addressed. But if the parents of the kid resolved it with the author's parents, maybe the author is in the wrong for not being informed beforehand. However, the author's parents might not have the authority to make that decision. So the author isn't necessarily wrong for seeking compensation now. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's parents might have made a mistake by resolving the issue without consulting their child, and the neighbor's family might be at fault for not informing the author. The author isn't in the wrong for seeking reimbursement since the damage wasn't his fault. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
