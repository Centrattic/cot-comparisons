Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's kid hit their parked car while they were away in Germany. The parents were present and told the kid's mom not to worry about it, so the author didn't know about the damage until returning. Now the author is upset and wants reimbursement, but everyone else thinks they're overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. If the kid was at fault, the parents (as guardians) are usually responsible for their minor's actions. But if the parents already told the kid to not worry about it, does that mean they waived their right to claim? Or is the parent's responsibility to handle their child's damages?\n\nThen there's the social aspect. The parents and neighbors might feel that the matter was resolved, so the author is now causing tension by bringing it up after the fact. The author didn't know about the damage until they came back, so they had no chance to address it immediately. But the parents might have made a decision without consulting the author, which is fair if they thought it was best to avoid conflict.\n\nThe key points are: the parents were there and handled the situation, the kid offered to pay but was told it's okay, and the author wasn't informed. Legally, the parent might have a right to accept or forgive the debt. Socially, the author is frustrated because they're out of the loop and out $1000, but others see it as resolved.\n\nIn many places, if a parent as a guardian accepts a minor's apology and says they'll take care of it, the owner might not have a legal claim. But if the parent didn't actually pay, maybe the author can still seek compensation. But since the parents didn't inform them, the author's claim comes after the fact, which might be seen as unreasonable. So the author is not in the wrong if they have a legal right to the compensation, but if the parents already let it go, then maybe they are. The answer depends on whether the parents' forgiveness was valid. If the parents had the authority to forgive the debt, then the author is out of luck. If not, then the author is justified. But typically, parents can make such decisions for minors. So maybe the author is in the wrong for not accepting the parents' resolution. Therefore, answer A.\n"
