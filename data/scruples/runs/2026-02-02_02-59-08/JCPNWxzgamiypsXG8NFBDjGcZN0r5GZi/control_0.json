Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit their parked car while they were abroad. The parents were there and the kid offered to pay, but the parents said not to worry about it. When the author comes back, they find out about the damage and want reimbursement, but everyone else is saying they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, if someone causes damage to your property, they are legally responsible for covering the costs. Even if the car was parked at the parents' house, the owner (the author) has the right to seek compensation. The parents might have settled it without the owner's knowledge, but that's not their decision to make, right? The parents might have been trying to be kind or avoid conflict, but the owner should have the final say on how to handle their property's damages.\n\nThen there's the moral angle. The kid did cause damage, even if accidentally. They did offer to pay, but the parents dismissed it. The author is now out $1000 because of someone else's mistake. It's understandable that they'd want to be reimbursed. But maybe the parents thought it was a minor issue or didn't think the kid could afford it. However, the author is the one who has to pay for the repairs, so they're the ones out of pocket.\n\nBut wait, the kid is a minor. In some cases, the parents are responsible for their child's actions. So maybe the kid's parents should cover the cost. But in this case, the kid's parents were there and told the author's parents not to worry. But the author's parents accepted that. Now the author is upset because they were not informed. Did the parents have the authority to make that decision on behalf of the car owner? Probably not, since the car belongs to the author. The parents might have been trying to help but overstepped.\n\nSo the author is not in the wrong for seeking reimbursement. The real issue is that the person responsible for the damage (the kid) and their parents didn't follow through with the proper compensation. The author is just trying to recover their own money. The people telling them they're the asshole might not understand the situation fully or are downplaying the financial loss.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
