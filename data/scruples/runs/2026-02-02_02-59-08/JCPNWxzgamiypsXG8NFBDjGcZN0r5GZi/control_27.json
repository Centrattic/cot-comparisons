Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit their parked car while they were abroad. The kid and his parents went to their parents' house to apologize, but the parents said not to worry about it. Now the author is upset because they didn't get reimbursement and everyone is telling them they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are: the kid caused damage, the parents were involved, the author's parents dismissed the issue, and the author is now seeking reimbursement after returning.\n\nLegally, if someone causes damage, they're responsible for covering the costs. But since the author's parents already handled the situation and told the kid's family not to worry about it, does that absolve the kid's family from liability? The author didn't know about the damage until returning, so they might feel wronged because they weren't informed. However, the parents might have resolved the issue themselves, expecting the kid to take responsibility then. But the kid was a minor, so the parents might have had the final say in the resolution. \n\nThe author's parents might have thought they were being kind by not pressing charges, but the author is now left with the financial burden. The author's parents might be in the wrong for not informing them. The author isn't the one who handled the initial interaction, so their desire for reimbursement isn't unreasonable. The kid did cause the damage, so the family should be responsible for compensation, regardless of what the author's parents said. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author's parents might have acted without consulting their child, leading to the author being caught off guard. However, the author's parents are the ones who were present, so maybe they should have informed their child. But the kid's family's responsibility remains. The author isn't wrong for seeking reimbursement since the damage wasn't their fault. The parents' decision to let it go doesn't negate the fact that the kid caused the damage. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They were the victim and didn't have a chance to handle the situation themselves. The answer should be B.\n"
