Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's kid hit the author's parked car while the author was abroad. The kid and his parents went to the author's parents' house, apologized, and offered to pay, but the parents waved it off. Now the author is upset because he wasn't informed and isn't getting compensation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, if someone damages your property, they're legally responsible for covering the costs. However, if the parents accepted the apology and dismissed the claim, does that mean the author can't pursue it now? That's unclear. But the author wasn't even informed until he returned, which is a problem because he couldn't handle it himself.\n\nThen there's the social aspect. The author's parents might have thought it was best to let it go, perhaps to avoid conflict or because they felt the kid was genuine in his apology. But the author is now facing a financial burden. Is it reasonable for him to expect reimbursement after the fact? If the parents already resolved it by not pressing charges, maybe the author is out of luck. But he wasn't consulted, so maybe that's an issue of parental authority versus ownership.\n\nAnother angle: the kid is 16, a minor. His parents are responsible for his actions. If the parents offered to pay and the author's parents accepted, that might be a settlement. But if the author's parents didn't inform him, they might have overstepped. The author is the car's owner, so he should have the right to decide whether to accept compensation or not. However, since the initial conflict was resolved by his parents, the author is now in a tricky spot.\n\nReddit users might split. Some might say the author is overreacting because his parents already handled it. Others might say the parents didn't inform him and the kid should still compensate him. Legally, if there's no formal agreement, maybe the author can still seek compensation. But if the parents accepted the apology and dismissed it, the kid's family might not be liable anymore. \n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but I need to check if that's accurate. The key points are whether the author's parents had the authority to waive the claim and if the author is justified in seeking reimbursement now. If the parents didn't inform him and resolved it, maybe the author shouldn't expect compensation. But if the resolution wasn't formal and the author is now facing costs, he might be in the right to ask. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because the parents didn't inform him, and the damage is his responsibility. However, the parents' actions might have legally settled the matter. But from a personal responsibility standpoint, the kid should pay. It's a bit of a gray area, but the author might not be in the wrong for wanting compensation, especially since he wasn't involved in the initial resolution.\n"
