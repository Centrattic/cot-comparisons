Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hitting the author's car while they were abroad. The parents were present when the incident happened and told the kid's parents not to worry about it. The author came back to find the damage and wants reimbursement, but others say he's overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal perspective. In many places, if someone causes damage to another's property, they're responsible for covering the costs. The kid is 16, so the parents might be liable since he's a minor. However, the author's parents were there and let it go, so maybe they waived any claim? But the car isn't theirs; it's the author's. Did the author's parents have the authority to forgive the debt on his behalf?\n\nThen there's the moral aspect. The kid admitted fault and offered to pay, but the author's parents declined. The author wasn't consulted, which is a problem. The author is now facing the financial burden because the parents didn't inform him. Is it fair for the author to seek compensation now, even after the initial non-action?\n\nAlso, the parents might have thought it was a small matter, but the cost is $1k, which is significant. The neighbor kid's parents might be in a position where they can't afford it, but that doesn't mean the author shouldn't seek what's owed. \n\nBut the author's parents might have made a decision that affects their son. Did they overstep by not communicating with him? The author wasn't present, so he didn't get to make that choice. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the kid hit the car, so legally he's at fault. The parents of the kid might have a duty to cover it. The author's parents, acting as property holders, might have a say, but the actual owner (the author) should be the one deciding. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be justified in seeking reimbursement because the responsible party is the kid, and the parents of the kid shouldn't be the ones to decide without involving the actual owner. The author wasn't informed, so he's in a tough spot. But maybe the parents of the car (the author's parents) let it go, so maybe they can't be held accountable now. Wait, the car belongs to the author, not his parents. So even if his parents were there, they don't have the legal right to waive compensation for him. Therefore, the author's request isn't unreasonable because the parents can't speak for him. \n\nSo the author isn't in the wrong. He's trying to get what's owed to him. The fact that his parents let it go might complicate things, but that doesn't mean he's wrong to seek reimbursement now. The neighbors are responsible for the damage, and the author is just trying to recover his costs. Others are calling him an asshole for being upset, but he's the victim here. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
