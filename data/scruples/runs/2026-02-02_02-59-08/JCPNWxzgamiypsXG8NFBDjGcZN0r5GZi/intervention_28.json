Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves a neighbor's kid hitting the author's parked car while they were abroad. The parents were present and told the kid and his mom not to worry about it, so no reimbursement was given. The author comes back to find the damage and is upset, but everyone says he's the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n\nHmm. The key points here are: the kid hit the car, the parents were informed but were told not to pay, and the author wasn't told. The author is now asking for compensation, but his parents and others think he's overreacting. \n\nFirst, legally, if someone causes damage, they should be responsible for repairs. The kid is a minor, so his parents would be liable. But the parents were told by the author's parents to not worry about it. However, the author wasn't consulted. So maybe the parents didn't have the authority to waive reimbursement? Or perhaps they should have discussed it with their son first. \n\nOn one hand, the kid made a mistake, but he did offer to pay. The parents might have thought it was a good idea to let it go since the car was in their neighborhood and they knew the family. But the author is now out $1,000 because of this. Is it fair for him to ask for reimbursement after being told not to worry about it? \n\nBut the author's parents might have thought they were handling it, but didn't consider their son's responsibility. The kid, being a minor, might need his parents to cover the costs. However, since the author's parents forgave the debt, maybe the author is in a tough spot. But is he in the wrong? \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the kid's family did hit the car, so they should be liable. But if the author's parents told them it's okay, does that absolve the kid's family? It's a bit of a gray area. The author isn't at fault for the accident, but by not being informed until after the fact, he's now facing unexpected costs. However, his parents' decision might be causing him to be in the wrong in the eyes of others. \n\nSo, from a moral standpoint, the kid should have informed the author or his parents about the damage and offered to pay. Since the author's parents didn't tell him, he was unaware. Now he's asking for compensation, which others see as overreacting because the parents said it's okay. But the author is the one who has to pay the bill. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because the damage wasn't his fault, and he's the one bearing the financial loss. The parents' decision not to inform him and to dismiss the responsibility is where the issue lies. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
