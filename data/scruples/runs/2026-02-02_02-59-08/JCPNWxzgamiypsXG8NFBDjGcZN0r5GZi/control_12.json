Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on their situation. The scenario involves a neighbor's kid damaging their car while they were abroad, and the author is upset about not being informed and not getting reimbursement. The parents told the kid's family not to worry about it, but the author feels wronged.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. If the car was damaged, the responsible party (the kid) is liable for damages. However, since the parents initially forgave the debt, there's a conflict between the original owner (the author) and their parents' decision. Legally, the author's parents might not have the authority to waive the claim, but that can vary by jurisdiction. It might be a gray area here.\n\nThen there's the moral aspect. The author was not informed, which is a problem. The kid did apologize and offer to pay, but the parents dismissed it. The author is upset about the lack of communication and financial responsibility. The community's take on this would likely consider whether the author is justified in seeking reimbursement after the fact. \n\nSome might argue that the author is being reasonable because it's their property and their money. Others might say that since the parents handled it, the author should accept it. But the key points are that the author wasn't informed and the damage is their financial burden. \n\nAlso, the kid was a minor, so the parents would typically be responsible for any damages. But if the parents already said they won't pay, the author might have a right to question that. However, the author's parents might have decided to let it go for the sake of neighborly relations, which complicates things. \n\nIn AITA situations, the community often looks at intentions and fairness. The author's intention is to get what's theirs, which is seen as reasonable. The kid's parents and the author's parents might have made a decision without considering the author's perspective. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They have a right to be informed about damage to their property and to seek reimbursement. The fact that they were not involved in the initial decision to forgive the debt makes their position understandable. The answer is B.\n"
