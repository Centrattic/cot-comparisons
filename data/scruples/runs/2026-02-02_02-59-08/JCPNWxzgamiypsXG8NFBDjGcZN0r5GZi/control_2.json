Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that their neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit their parked car while they were abroad. The parents were there and the kid apologized, but the parents said not to worry about it. The author came back to find $1k damage and is upset they weren't informed and aren't being compensated. Others, including their parents, say they're overreacting.\n\nFirst, the kid was at fault for causing the damage. Since he's a minor, his parents would be responsible. The parents were present during the incident and chose to say not to worry about it. But the owner of the car wasn't there, so they couldn't handle it themselves. The parents didn't inform the owner, so the owner has a right to be upset. Legally, the parents might be responsible for the kid's actions. The author is seeking reimbursement, which is reasonable. The fact that the parents didn't tell them about the incident is a problem. The author isn't the one who caused the damage, so their reaction is justified. The answer should be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
