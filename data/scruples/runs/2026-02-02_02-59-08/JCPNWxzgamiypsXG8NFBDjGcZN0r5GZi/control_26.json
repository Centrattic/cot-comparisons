Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit their parked car, causing $1k damage. The parents were at the scene, the kid apologized, and the parents said not to worry about it. The author didn't know until returning and is upset about not being informed or compensated. Others think the author is overreacting.\n\nFirst, legal perspective: In most places, if someone causes damage, they're responsible for covering repairs. Even if the parents made a deal on the spot, the car owner (the author) might still have a right to claim the cost. But since the author's parents were present, maybe they had the authority to settle the matter, depending on ownership. If the car is the author's, then they might have the right to seek reimbursement, even if the parents initially said not to worry about it. But maybe there's a cultural or social norm where letting go of minor incidents is the standard, which could make the author seem unreasonable for pursuing it after the fact.\n\nSocially, the neighbors might feel that the author's parents handled it, so the author coming back to demand payment could be seen as a breach of trust or causing tension. The kid is a minor, so liability might fall on the parents, but again, if the parents already offered to pay and the author's parents accepted, maybe the matter was settled. However, if the author wasn't informed and the parents didn't have the authority to waive the claim, the author could be in the right.\n\nBut the key points are: Did the author's parents have the authority to settle the claim? If the car is the author's, then maybe they can still pursue compensation despite their parents' initial decision. However, if the parents were acting as intermediaries and the author wasn't informed, there might be a communication breakdown. The neighbors might think the issue was resolved, so the author's sudden request could come off as unexpected and causing conflict. \n\nIn terms of being the \"asshole,\" it's a mix of legal rights and social expectations. Legally, the responsible party should cover the damage. Socially, if the matter was considered settled, the author's reaction might be seen as overstepping. However, the author is not at fault for the accident and is seeking what's owed to them. So the answer might hinge on whether the initial settlement was valid. If the parents had the authority, the author is in the wrong for not knowing. If not, the author is justified.\n"
