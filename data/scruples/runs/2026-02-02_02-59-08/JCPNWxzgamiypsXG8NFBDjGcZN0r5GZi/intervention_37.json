Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's kid hit their parked car while they were abroad. The kid and his parents went to the author's parents, apologized, and the parents said not to worry about it. Now the author is upset because they weren't informed and aren't getting compensation.\n\nFirst, from a legal standpoint, if someone damages another person's property, they are generally responsible for covering the costs. However, the parents of the kid might have resolved the issue on their own, which could complicate things. The author's parents might have decided to let it go, maybe out of goodwill or to avoid conflict. But the author feels wronged because they weren't informed and now have to pay for repairs.\n\nLegally, the author might still be entitled to compensation. If the kid was at fault, the parents could be liable as guardians. However, if the author's parents accepted the apology and dismissed the matter, it's possible that they considered it resolved. The author's not being informed is a point against the neighbor, but also the parents might have thought they were handling it for the author's benefit.\n\nEmotionally, the author is upset because they had to pay unexpectedly. The neighbors might feel that since the parents were present, the matter was settled. However, the author is the rightful owner of the car, so they have the right to seek compensation. The neighbors not informing the author is a problem because the owner should be the one to decide whether to accept compensation or not.\n\nIn Reddit terms, the community often sides with the victim in such cases, especially when there's a financial loss. The author isn't in the wrong here because they're the one who suffered the damage and the neighbors didn't inform them. The parents might have overstepped by handling it without consulting the author. So, the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
