Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is that a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit the author's parked car while the author was abroad. The kid's parents were present, they apologized, and apparently told the author's parents not to worry about it. Now the author is upset because he wasn't informed and has to pay for the damages.\n\nHmm, so the author is returning to find the damage and is upset about not being reimbursed. The parents and others are telling him to forget it. The question is whether he's in the wrong for seeking reimbursement.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if someone causes damage, they're usually responsible for compensating the owner. But since the parents were present and might have resolved it, maybe there was an agreement. But the author wasn't there, so he didn't have a chance to negotiate. However, the parents might have been acting on his behalf since the car is his. \n\nBut maybe the kid's parents didn't have the authority to make that decision? Wait, in many places, parents are responsible for their children's actions, especially if the kid is a minor. The parents might be liable, so the author has a right to claim compensation. But the parents of the kid might have offered to cover it, and the author's parents accepted. If that's the case, maybe there's a settlement already. However, the author wasn't consulted, so he might not be aware of that. \n\nThe author's parents might have the authority to accept on his behalf, but if they agreed not to pursue it, the author might be bound by that agreement. However, if the agreement was made without the owner's consent (since the author was out of the country), that could be an issue. The parents might have overstepped their authority. \n\nSo, the kid is at fault for causing the damage. The parents might have tried to resolve it, but if they accepted liability and the damage was supposed to be covered, but the author's parents dismissed it, maybe that's where the problem is. The author is now left out of pocket because his parents didn't follow through. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the kid's parents might have agreed to pay, but the author's parents told them not to worry. But the author's parents might have done that to avoid conflict, not realizing the cost. The author is now upset that he's stuck with the bill. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for expecting reimbursement? If the parents already settled it, maybe he shouldn't be seeking it. But if they didn't have the authority to settle it, he's not in the wrong. This is a bit tricky. \n\nI think the key points are: the kid caused damage, the parents were involved, they might have agreed to pay, but the author's parents dismissed it. The author's parents might have the right to represent him, but maybe they didn't. If they did, then the author can't expect compensation. If they didn't, then he's justified in seeking it. \n\nBut since the author wasn't informed and the parents didn't get his permission to let the matter rest, maybe they shouldn't have done that. So the author's parents might be at fault here. But the question is about the author being in the wrong. The author is upset and asking for reimbursement. If the parents already accepted the apology and said not to worry, then the author might not be in the right to go back and seek compensation. \n\nAlternatively, if the parents didn't have the authority to let the matter rest, then the author can still claim. But if they did, then he can't. So it's a bit ambiguous. However, the author's parents might have acted without his consent, which is a problem. But the author is now seeking compensation after the fact, which could be seen as going back on an agreement made by his parents. \n\nIn that case, the author might be in the wrong because his parents, being the legal guardians or caretakers, might have the authority to settle the matter. So if they did, then the author can't expect payment. But if they didn't have the authority, then he's not in the wrong. \n\nSince the car is the author's, the parents might not have the legal authority to settle it without his consent. Therefore, the author's parents might have no right to accept the apology and let it go. In that case, the author is not in the wrong for seeking reimbursement because the settlement wasn't properly authorized. \n\nSo the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). But I need to check if the parents can make such decisions. If the parents are the car's legal owners, then maybe they can. But if the car is owned by the author, then the parents can't settle the claim. Therefore, the author's parents might have no right to do that, so the author is justified in seeking reimbursement. \n\nThus, the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
