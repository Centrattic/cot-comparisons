Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it.

Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit their parked car while they were in Germany. The parents of the kid went to the author's parents' house and the parents said not to worry about it. The author is upset because they didn't get reimbursement and everyone is telling them they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal perspective. If someone's property is damaged, especially by a minor, the responsibility usually falls on the parents. The kid is a minor, so the parents should handle the damages. The fact that the parents went to the author's parents and said not to worry about it might mean they didn't take responsibility. But the author didn't know about the damage until returning. \n\nThen there's the moral aspect. The author's parents might have forgiven the cost, but the author is the owner of the car. They argue that the kid should reimburse them. The neighbors might feel that since the parents already sorted it out, the author shouldn't come back and ask for money. But the author wasn't informed, so they couldn't have resolved it while they were away. \n\nAlso, the kid apologized and offered to pay, but the parents refused. Now the author is upset because they have to pay for repairs. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for expecting reimbursement now. \n\nLegally, the author might have a case if the parents didn't properly address the damage. But if the author's parents dismissed the issue, maybe they were complicit in not holding the other party accountable. However, the author wasn't involved in that conversation. \n\nIn terms of social norms, it's possible that the community expects forgiveness in such situations, especially with kids. But the author is being told they're an asshole for seeking compensation after the fact. The neighbors might think that since the matter was settled by the parents, bringing it up later is unfair. \n\nBut the author didn't know about the damage until returning. They couldn't have resolved it while away. So, maybe the author is justified in seeking reimbursement now. The neighbors might be wrong to expect them to just accept the damage without compensation. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The parents might have overstepped by dismissing the issue without consulting the car owner. The author has a right to expect that damages are covered, especially since they weren't part of the initial resolution. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
