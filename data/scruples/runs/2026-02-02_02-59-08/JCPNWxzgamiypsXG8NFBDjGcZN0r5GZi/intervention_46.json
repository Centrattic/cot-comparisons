Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit their parked car while they were away. The parents were there and the kid apologized, but the parents said not to worry about it. Now the author is upset because they weren't informed and want reimbursement.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In most places, when someone damages another's property, they're responsible for the damages. However, since the car owner was away and the parents were present, they might have authority to handle the situation. If the parents accepted the apology and let it go, maybe the legal responsibility is settled. But the author didn't know about the incident until returning, so they might feel wronged because their property was damaged without them being informed.\n\nThen there's the social aspect. The parents might have decided not to inform the author to avoid conflict, especially if the kid is just a teenager. The author might feel that the parents should have informed them, especially since it's their car and they should have the right to decide about reimbursement. The neighbors might think the author is overreacting because the parents already handled it, but the author is now facing financial loss.\n\nAlso, the age of the kid is 16. Depending on the country's laws, a minor's parents are usually responsible for any damages their child causes. So the parents might be liable. If the parents knew, maybe they should have informed the car owner. The parents might have acted out of politeness or to prevent the teenager from getting into trouble, but that doesn't necessarily absolve them of responsibility.\n\nAnother angle: the author's parents said not to worry about it, but the author is the owner of the car. The parents might not have the authority to waive the right to compensation unless they are co-owners, but in this case, the car is the author's. So maybe the parents shouldn't have made that decision without consulting the author. So the author might have a valid point in feeling that the parents shouldn't have dismissed the matter.\n\nBut then, the neighbors might have acted in good faith. If the parents were acting as intermediaries, maybe they should have informed the actual owner. However, if the car was at their house, they might have thought it was their responsibility to handle it. It's a bit of a gray area. Legally, the parents might be responsible for the kid's actions, but the actual car owner (the author) has the right to claim damages. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong for asking for reimbursement? If the parents already accepted the apology and let it go, maybe the author shouldn't be upset because the issue was resolved. However, since the parents didn't inform the author, the author might not have had a chance to make a decision. So the parents might be at fault for not informing their own child's owner about the damage. The author isn't wrong for seeking reimbursement, but maybe the parents should have communicated better.\n\nIn terms of the AITA aspect, the Reddit community often considers intent and who acted wrong. The kid did the damage, the parents handled it, but the author wasn't informed. The author is now being blamed by others, but maybe they aren't the one at fault. The parents might be the ones who should have informed the author. So the answer might lean towards B (author not in the wrong), because the parents shouldn't have dismissed the claim without consulting the car owner, and the kid's parents are responsible for the damages caused by their child.\n"
