Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. Let me read through the details again.\n\nThe author's car was hit by a 16-year-old neighbor while they were abroad in Germany. The kid and his mother went to the parents' house, apologized, and offered to pay, but the parents dismissed it. Now the author is upset because they weren't informed and there's no compensation. They're being told by others, including their parents, to just let it go, but they feel wronged because they have to pay for the repairs.\n\nFirst, the kid was at fault for causing the damage. The parents should have informed the car owner (the author) about the incident. Even if the kid apologized and offered to pay, the parents' decision to not inform the owner is a problem. The author didn't know about the damage until returning, which is why they're upset. \n\nThe key points here are responsibility and communication. The neighbor's family had a duty to notify the car owner. Since the car is the author's property, they have a right to know about the damage and to seek reimbursement. The fact that the parents told the neighbor not to worry about it doesn't absolve the kid of responsibility. The author isn't overreacting by seeking compensation because they're the one who has to pay for the repairs. \n\nOthers saying the author is the asshole might not realize that the responsibility for the damage lies with the neighbor, not the author. The author's parents might have handled the situation poorly by not informing their child. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. They're seeking what's fair. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
