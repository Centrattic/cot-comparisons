Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor kid hit their parked car while they were in Germany, causing $1000 in damage. The parents who were at home didn't tell the author and also said not to worry about reimbursement. Now the author is upset because they have to pay for repairs and everyone's saying they're the asshole for asking for compensation.\n\nFirst, I need to assess who's at fault here. The kid hit the car, which is clearly his responsibility. But the parents were there and handled the situation. They told the kid to apologize and offered to pay, but the parents said not to worry. The author wasn't informed until returning.\n\nLegally, in many places, if someone damages your property, they're responsible for damages. But since the parents might have already addressed it by saying not to worry, maybe there's an assumption of forgiveness. However, the parents might not have the authority to forgive on behalf of the car owner, especially if the owner wasn't consulted.\n\nMoral perspective: The kid did something wrong, but the parents tried to resolve it. The author is now upset because they weren't informed and have to deal with the costs. The question is whether it's reasonable for the author to seek reimbursement after the fact.\n\nThe author's parents might have thought the issue was settled by the neighbor's offer to pay, but if they didn't collect the money and then told them to forget it, maybe they made a hasty decision. The author is now in a tough spot because they weren't part of the decision-making.\n\nBut was the author wrong for asking for reimbursement? If the damage was done to their property, they have a right to compensation. However, if the parents already accepted the apology and declined payment, maybe the author is overstepping by later demanding money. It depends on whether the parents had the authority to waive that right.\n\nIn some contexts, if the car owner wasn't present, the parents might act as representatives, but if the car is in the author's name, maybe only they can decide. If the parents didn't inform the author, that's a problem. The author is upset because they weren't told, which shows a communication issue within the family.\n\nReddit often sides with people demanding compensation for damages, but family dynamics can complicate things. The neighbors might have thought they resolved it, but the author is now facing the financial burden. The author isn't wrong for seeking reimbursement, but maybe the way they approached it or the fact that they didn't know earlier could affect perceptions.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They are the victim of a property damage incident and have a right to compensation. The parents and neighbors might have miscalculated by not involving the car owner. Therefore, the answer would be B (author not in the wrong).\n"
