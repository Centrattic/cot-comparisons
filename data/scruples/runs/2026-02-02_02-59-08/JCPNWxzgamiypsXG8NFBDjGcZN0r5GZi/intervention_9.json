Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit the author's parked car while they were away. The kid and his mom went to the author's parents' house, apologized, and the parents told them not to worry about it. Now the author is upset because he wasn't informed and there's no compensation.\n\nFirst, the kid was responsible for the damage. At 16, he's a minor, so his parents are probably liable. But the parents were upset about the author's parents not pressing charges. The parents decided to let it go. The author is now angry because he had to pay for repairs. \n\nThe author is asking if he's in the wrong for wanting reimbursement after his parents forgave the debt. The key here is whether the parents had the authority to forgive the debt. If the car was registered under the author, the parents might not have the legal right to waive the kid's responsibility. But maybe they thought they were being kind. \n\nThe author's parents might have been trying to be good neighbors, but in doing so, they possibly let the neighbor family off the hook without the owner's consent. The author is the actual owner, so he's in a tough spot. The neighbors didn't inform him because the parents told them not to, but the author feels wronged because he has to cover the cost. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the parents had the right to forgive the debt, maybe not. But if they didn't, then the author isn't at fault. The neighbors are responsible for the damage, and the parents might have made a mistake in letting them off. The author is just trying to get what's owed to him. The neighbors might argue that the parents handled it, but the author's parents might not have the legal standing to do that. \n\nSo I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. He's trying to get compensation for damage done to his property, which he's entitled to. The parents' actions might have been misguided, but the author isn't at fault for what happened.\n"
