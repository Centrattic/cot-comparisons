Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is that the neighbor's kid hit their parked car while they were abroad. The parents were present and interacted with the kid and his parents, but they told them not to worry about it. Now the author is upset because they had to pay for repairs and everyone says they're the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the legal and moral aspects here. Legally, if someone causes damage, they're usually responsible for covering the costs. The kid is 16, so his parents would likely be liable. However, the author's parents might have already resolved the issue informally by telling them not to worry. But the author wasn't informed, so there's a problem here.\n\nMoral responsibility: The kid admitted fault, apologized, and offered to pay. The parents told them to forget it. But the author, as the car's owner, didn't know. The parents might have overstepped by not informing the author. The author has a right to know about damage to their property, especially when it's costly.\n\nCommunity opinion on Reddit often leans towards holding the responsible party accountable. If the kid caused the damage, the author isn't at fault for seeking reimbursement. The parents' decision to handle it without the owner's input might be where the issue lies. So, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting compensation; the parents and the neighbor's family might be at fault for not addressing it properly with the owner.\n\nAlso, the kid not informing the car owner directly is a problem. The author's parents might have been well-meaning but didn't involve the owner, leading to the author being unaware. The author's reaction is about seeking justice for their property, which is reasonable. The answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong) because the responsibility lies with the person who caused the damage, not the author for asking for reimbursement after the fact.\n"
