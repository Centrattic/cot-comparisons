Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor kid hit their parked car when they were abroad, causing $1,000 in damage. The parents were present and told the kid not to worry about it, even though he offered to pay. The author now wants reimbursement but is being called an asshole for it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal and ethical aspects. Legally, if the kid is a minor, the responsibility might fall on the parents. But since the parents already told the kid it's okay, maybe the author's parents handled it. However, the car belongs to the author, so maybe they have a right to know about the damage. But the parents might have thought they were being kind by not burdening the kid financially, especially if he's a minor and they don't want to report it to the insurance or authorities. \n\nEthically, the kid did apologize and offered to pay, but the parents declined. The author is upset because they weren't informed and have to cover the costs. The parents might have been trying to avoid conflict or stress for their own child. But the author is now being criticized for wanting compensation. \n\nI should check if the parents had the authority to dismiss the claim. If the car was owned by the author, then the parents might not have the legal right to decide on their behalf. But maybe the parents have been managing the car while the author was away. However, the author's right to know about the damage is important. \n\nAlso, the kid is 16, so not a legal adult. If the parents accepted the apology and told the kid not to worry about it, perhaps they're taking responsibility as the guardians. But if the author is the owner, they might have a claim. \n\nIn some places, if someone hits a parked car and doesn't report it, it's a hit-and-run. But in this case, the kid did try to resolve it with the parents. The parents might have been advised not to report it to avoid insurance issues or because the damage was minor. However, the author isn't being reimbursed and is now stuck with the cost. \n\nThe community's take on Reddit usually considers intentions. The kid's parents and neighbors might think the author is being harsh because the kid was offered to pay and the parents forgave it. But the author is in a position where they have to pay out of pocket. \n\nSo, the author's stance is that the kid should reimburse him. The parents said it's okay, but the author wasn't consulted. That's a key point. If the parents could have covered the cost and didn't inform the author, maybe they are responsible for not communicating. \n\nBut if the author is now returning and the parents had already decided not to pursue compensation, maybe the author is in the wrong for not being informed in advance. Or maybe the parents should have informed him. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nI think the main issue is that the author's parents handled the situation without consulting him. They might have thought they were being lenient, but the author is now facing the financial burden. However, if the parents were acting on the author's behalf, maybe they should have considered his wishes. \n\nConsidering all this, I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong. The parents might not have had the right to dismiss the claim without the owner's input. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
