Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a neighbor's kid hitting their parked car while they were abroad, and when the owner returns, he's upset because no one told him and there's no reimbursement. The parents and others think he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The kid was at fault for the accident. The parents were informed and even discussed it with the kid's family. The parents chose not to pursue compensation, maybe out of kindness or to keep things amicable. The owner wasn't told because he was away, and now he's upset about the financial loss.\n\nThe key points here are: the kid is legally responsible for the damage. In most places, if someone's property is damaged, the owner can claim compensation. However, the parents of the owner didn't inform their child, which might be seen as a way to avoid conflict. The kid did apologize and offer to pay, but the parents of the car owner dismissed it. \n\nThe question is about the author's right in asking for reimbursement. Legally, the author has a right to claim since the damage was done without their knowledge. However, the parents and neighbors might feel that the author is overstepping because the matter was already addressed by the parents who chose to forgive the damage. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the kid's family did offer to pay, but the parents of the car owner didn't push for it. The author, upon returning, finds out about the damage and wants reimbursement. The others might see this as the author not respecting the parents' decision to let it go. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he's now coming forward after the initial issue was supposedly settled by his parents, others might think he's being inconsiderate. However, legally, he's not wrong to seek reimbursement since it's his property. The parents might have overstepped by not informing him and dismissing the matter without his input.\n\nThe answer depends on the perspective. Legally, the author isn't wrong. Morally, if the parents had already decided to let it go, the author might be seen as the asshole for not respecting their decision. But the parents didn't consult him, so he has a right to be upset. \n\nIn the Reddit context, the question is about being the asshole, which is more about social morality. If the parents didn't tell him and others think he's overreacting, then maybe he's not the asshole. But if the parents' decision to let it go was final, then he's overstepping. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because the damage is his responsibility to repair, and the parents didn't inform him. The kid's family did offer to pay, so the author is justified in seeking reimbursement. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
