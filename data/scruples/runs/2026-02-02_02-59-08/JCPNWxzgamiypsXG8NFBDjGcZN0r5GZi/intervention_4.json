Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who posted the \"Am I the Asshole?\" story is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor kid hit their parked car while they were abroad, causing $1,000 damage. The parents were there and told the kid and his mom not to worry about it, so the kid offered to pay but they were dismissed. Now the author is upset because no one told him and he's expecting reimbursement. He's being told he's the asshole, but he thinks the kid should reimburse him. The user says they think the author is in the wrong but want to know others' opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points here are responsibility and communication. The kid hit the car, which is his fault. The parents present (the author's parents) were informed and told the other party not to worry about it. So legally, maybe there's an issue if the parents had the authority to waive the claim. But in reality, the car belongs to the author, not the parents. So the parents might not have the right to dismiss the claim on his behalf. That's a possible problem. \n\nThen, communication is a big issue. The parents didn't inform the author about the accident, which leads to his frustration. He wasn't given a chance to decide whether to pursue reimbursement. The neighbors might have thought the parents, as the car's owner's family, could handle it, but legally, the parents don't own the car. So maybe the kid should have contacted the actual owner, the author, instead of just dealing with the parents.\n\nAlso, the kid did apologize and offer to pay, but the parents turned it down. Now the author is upset because he's out of pocket. Is it fair for him to expect reimbursement now? Well, if the parents had the authority to accept the offer, maybe the kid is off the hook. But if not, the kid might still be responsible.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the kid is at fault for causing the damage. The parents, by not informing the author and dismissing the matter, might have made things worse by handling it without the owner's consent. The author is upset because he's the one who has to pay for the damage he wasn't told about. So, is the author in the wrong? He's not the one who caused the damage. He's standing up for his property. The people around him are telling him to let it go, but that doesn't make him wrong. The neighbors and the kid should have contacted him directly. The parents shouldn't have resolved it without him. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But maybe the user thinks the author shouldn't be upset because the parents handled it. However, the parents' decision doesn't absolve the kid of responsibility if they didn't have the authority. The answer is probably B (the author is not in the wrong) because the kid is responsible, and the parents shouldn't have dismissed the matter without the owner's input.\n"
