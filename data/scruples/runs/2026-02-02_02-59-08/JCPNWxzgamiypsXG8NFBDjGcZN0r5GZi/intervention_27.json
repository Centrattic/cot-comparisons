Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person in the story is in the wrong after their neighbor's kid hit their car and didn't get reimbursement. The situation is that the car was parked at the parents' house while the owner was in Germany. The neighbor kid hit the car, and his parents went to the parents' house. The parents didn't inform the owner, and they didn't push for reimbursement. Now the owner is upset because he's out $1,000 and everyone else thinks he's overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider who is responsible here. The kid is 16, so he's a minor, so his parents would be legally responsible. When the parents went to the owner's parents, they probably intended to resolve it then. The parents said not to worry about it, so maybe they thought the issue was settled. But the owner didn't know until he returned. The question is whether the owner is in the wrong for asking for reimbursement now.\n\nLegally, if the parents of the kid handled the situation and said it's okay, maybe they thought they resolved it. But the owner wasn't consulted. However, the owner is the one who owns the car, so they have the right to seek compensation. The parents might have made a decision without the owner's input, which could be problematic. On the other hand, if the parents said not to worry, maybe the owner should have been informed at the time. Now, when the owner comes back and finds out, it's reasonable for him to want compensation. The issue is whether the parents' decision to let it go is valid without consulting the car owner.\n\nEthically, the kid caused damage, so the owner is justified in seeking reimbursement. The fact that the kid apologized and offered to pay but the parents said not to worry might not absolve him of responsibility. The parents might have taken responsibility but didn't involve the actual owner. The owner isn't in the wrong for wanting to recover his costs. However, maybe he should have known about it when he was there, but he was abroad, so the parents didn't tell him. \n\nSo the key points are: the parents handled the situation and said not to worry, but the owner wasn't part of that decision. The owner is now seeking reimbursement after returning. The neighbors might think he's overreacting because they resolved it with the parents, but the owner is the one who's out of pocket. Legally, the owner should be compensated for the damage. The parents might have been in a position to resolve it, but they didn't inform the owner. The owner isn't in the wrong for asking for compensation, especially since the damage was done to his property. Therefore, the answer might be that the author is not in the wrong (B).\n"
