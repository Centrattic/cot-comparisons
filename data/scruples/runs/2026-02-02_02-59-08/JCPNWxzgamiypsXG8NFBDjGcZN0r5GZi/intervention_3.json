Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hitting the author's parked car while the author was abroad. The parents were present when the incident happened, the kid apologized, and the parents were advised not to worry about it. Now the author is upset because he wasn't informed and isn't getting compensation. Others think he's overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal perspective. In many places, if someone causes damage to another's property, they are responsible for paying for repairs. But here, the kid is a minor, so the parents would be responsible. However, the parents were present and told the author's parents not to pursue it. The author's parents didn't inform him, which complicates things. \n\nLegally, the author might still have a right to compensation since he's the car owner. The parents might have the authority to settle the claim, but if they dismissed it without consulting the author, that could be an issue. However, the parents might have been trying to prevent escalation, especially since the kid is a minor. The author's parents might have been acting in good faith to resolve it amicably, but they didn't communicate properly with their son living abroad.\n\nFrom the neighbor's perspective, they might have been trying to handle it locally and thought they reached a resolution. The kid apologized and offered to pay, but the parents were advised not to proceed. The neighbor might feel it's resolved, hence not informing the author when he returns. But the author is now facing the financial burden without prior knowledge.\n\nMoral responsibility: The neighbor's kid caused the damage, so they should be responsible. But since the parents were involved and the author's parents dismissed it, the author is left out of the loop. The author's parents might have overstepped by not informing their son, who is the owner. The author isn't the one who hit the car, so he's not at fault. However, he might be expected to handle this maturely, as the initial resolution was made in his absence. \n\nSocial expectations: In some cultures, people might avoid legal action for minor incidents, especially involving minors. But in others, the owner has the right to seek compensation regardless. The problem is that the author's parents didn't communicate, leaving him in the dark. \n\nConsidering all this, the author is not at fault. The kid and his parents are responsible for the damage. The author's parents made a decision without considering his right to know and seek compensation. The author is justified in wanting reimbursement. Others labeling him as the asshole might be because they believe the issue was settled, but the author wasn't involved in that decision. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
