Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit their parked car while they were abroad. The parents were informed, and they let it go, but when the owner comes back, he's upset because he wasn't told and he's being asked to pay for the damage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider who's at fault here. The kid hit the car, but he's a minor. His parents were present when the incident happened. They went to the author's parents and the author's parents dismissed it. Now, the author is angry because he wasn't informed and there's no compensation.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the author's parents didn't inform him about the incident, which is a problem. But the kid's parents were there and the author's parents told them not to worry. The author is upset because he's responsible for the damage, but he wasn't there. Legally, the parents might have a case here if they allowed the kid to fix it themselves, but the author is asking for reimbursement after the fact.\n\nBut maybe the author is overreacting because his parents already handled it. However, he's the one who has to pay for the repairs. The neighbors might be in the wrong for not informing him. But the author's parents also didn't inform him. So where does responsibility lie?\n\nIn terms of legal liability, the kid's parents might be responsible since he's a minor. The author's parents might have the right to let the kid fix it, but the author is now stuck with the cost. The author is upset because he's not been informed and is being told to just accept it. \n\nConsidering all that, the author isn't necessarily wrong for asking for reimbursement. The neighbors didn't inform him, and the kid's parents should have covered the damage. But the author's parents also didn't inform him, which complicates things. However, the author is the one who has to pay, so he's not in the wrong for seeking compensation. The real issue is the lack of communication and the neighbors not taking responsibility. So the answer is B.\n"
