Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit their parked car while they were away. The parents were there and spoke to the kid and his mom. The kid apologized and offered to pay, but the parents were told not to worry about it. Now the author is upset because he didn't know about the damage and there's no compensation.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The main issue is whether the author is wrong for wanting reimbursement. The kid caused damage, so legally, the responsible party (the kid's parents) should cover the cost. But since the parents already told them not to worry about it, maybe the author is overstepping by coming back and asking for compensation after the fact.\n\nBut wait, the author wasn't there. His parents were, and they might have resolved it. However, the author's parents might have been too lenient. The kid did offer to pay, but the parents were told not to worry. So maybe the author's parents were the ones who let it go, making the author the one now upset. \n\nBut the author is the car owner. Even though he wasn't present, the damage was done to his property. He has a right to be informed and to seek compensation. The fact that his parents didn't inform him raises questions. Were they supposed to tell him when he got back? Or was it their decision to forgive the damages?\n\nAlso, the kid is a minor, so his parents would be responsible. If the parents said it's okay, maybe they can't be held accountable again. But the author could argue that the initial agreement wasn't with him, so he's within his rights to seek compensation now. \n\nBut the community is saying he's the asshole. They might think that because the parents already handled it, he's being unreasonable now. However, from a legal standpoint, the responsible parties might still be liable. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the parents resolved it without informing him, maybe he's not at fault. But if he's now seeking reimbursement after the initial resolution, that could make him seem like the asshole. \n\nHmm. The key here is whether the author's parents had the authority to forgive the damage on his behalf. If the car is his, then maybe they didn't, so he's justified in seeking reimbursement. But if they did have that authority, then he's overstepping. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the parents didn't realize the extent of the damage or thought it was minor. But the author is now left with a $1k repair. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the damage was done to his property, and he's within his rights to seek compensation. The parents might have resolved it with the neighbor, but maybe they didn't inform him because they thought it was sorted. However, the author is not wrong for wanting to be compensated for his own property. The kid caused the damage, so the responsibility is on the kid's parents. The fact that the author's parents were lenient doesn't absolve the other party's responsibility. So the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
