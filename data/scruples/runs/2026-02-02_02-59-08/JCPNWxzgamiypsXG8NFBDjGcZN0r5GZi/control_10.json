Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that a neighbor's kid hit their car while they were away, and when they returned, there was $1,000 damage. The kid and his mom went to the parents' house, apologized, and offered to pay, but the parents let it slide. Now the author is upset because they weren't told and there's no compensation. The key points are: the kid caused damage, the parents were informed but told the kid not to worry, and the author is now seeking reimbursement.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, if someone damages another's property, they're usually responsible for the damages. So the kid (being a minor) would likely have his parents cover the cost. The fact that the parents were approached and told not to pay might complicate things. However, the original owner (the author) wasn't informed. They have a right to know about the damage to their property and to seek compensation.\n\nEthically, the parents might have overstepped by dismissing the issue. The author's parents might have done so to avoid conflict, but that doesn't mean the author isn't entitled to be reimbursed. The author didn't know about the incident until they came back, so they couldn't have handled it themselves. The kid's parents' decision to not pay affects the author, who now has to bear the financial burden.\n\nThe neighbors might argue that the author's parents already resolved it, but the author wasn't part of that resolution. The author has a right to be involved in decisions regarding their property. The fact that the kid offered to pay but was stopped by his parents suggests that there was an opportunity to settle it then, but the author's parents didn't act in the author's best interest.\n\nIn terms of community opinion, the neighbors and parents might see the author as overreacting because the issue was supposedly \"handled,\" but that's from their perspective. The author is the one who actually has to deal with the financial loss. So the author isn't in the wrong for seeking reimbursement; they're standing up for their rights. The problem here is that the initial parties (the parents) didn't communicate with the actual owner. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
