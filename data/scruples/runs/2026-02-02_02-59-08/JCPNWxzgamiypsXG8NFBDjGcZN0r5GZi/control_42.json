Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit their parked car while they were in Germany. The kid and his mom went to the parent's house, apologized, offered to pay, but the parents said it's okay. When the author comes back, they find out about the damage and want reimbursement, but everyone says they're the asshole for asking.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, when someone damages your property, they're legally responsible to compensate you. Even if the parents were told, the original owner (the author) should be the one getting compensation. If the parents said not to worry, maybe they thought they could handle it, but the kid's family might still be responsible. However, if the kid is a minor, the parents are typically liable.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The author's parents didn't inform them about the damage, which is a big issue. The author didn't know until returning, which is a shock. The kid did apologize and offer to pay, but the parents might have dismissed it. The author's frustration is about being out $1,000 without prior notice.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong to ask for reimbursement. Legally, they might have a right to it. Ethically, the parents might have made a mistake by not informing them. The community's take might be that the author isn't the asshole because the kid caused damage and should compensate, even if the parents tried to handle it. But some might say the author is overreacting because the parents already dealt with it.\n\nHowever, the key points are that the author wasn't informed, and the kid's family might have already offered compensation which was dismissed. If the parents accepted the apology and said not to worry, maybe the author isn't in a position to demand payment now. But if the parents didn't communicate properly, the author is justified in seeking reimbursement. The answer depends on whether the parents' actions released the kid's family from liability. If the parents didn't settle the matter, the author is in the right. If they did, then maybe not. But the lack of communication makes it unclear. The author's not being informed is a big issue, so they might not be in the wrong.\n"
