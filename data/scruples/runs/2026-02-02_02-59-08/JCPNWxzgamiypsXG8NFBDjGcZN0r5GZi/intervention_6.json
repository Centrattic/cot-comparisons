Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is that a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit the author's parked car while they were away. The kid and his mom went to the author's parents, apologized, offered to pay, but the parents told them not to worry about it. Now the author is upset because they weren't informed and didn't get any compensation. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for asking for reimbursement.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and social aspects here. Legally, when someone damages another's property, they are typically responsible for the damages. However, in this case, the parents of the kid were involved and chose to waive any liability. The author's parents told the neighbors not to worry about it, which might mean they accepted the apology and forgave the damages. \n\nBut wait, the author is the owner of the car. If the parents didn't consult the author, they might not have the authority to absolve the damages. The author wasn't present, so maybe the parents overstepped their role. Legally, the owner of the car (the author) is the one who can decide on compensation. If the parents didn't get the author's consent, they might have made a unilateral decision.\n\nOn the other hand, the neighbors did try to resolve it by going to the parents, and the parents accepted the apology and the offer to pay but chose to let it go. The author is now upset because they weren't informed and now have to pay for repairs. The author's parents might be protecting the neighbor's child, perhaps out of goodwill or to avoid conflict.\n\nFrom a social perspective, some might say the author is overreacting because the issue was resolved by the parents. Others might argue that the author has the right to expect their property to be protected and that the parents shouldn't have made that decision without consulting the owner. \n\nAlso, the kid is a minor, so the parents would typically be responsible for any damages. But if the parents chose not to pursue it, maybe they covered it, but in this case, they didn't. The author now has to pay out of pocket. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the parents had the authority to forgive the damages, then the author might be in the wrong for expecting reimbursement now. However, if the parents didn't have the authority, then the author is justified in seeking compensation. \n\nBut wait, in many jurisdictions, a parent's agreement to settle a claim on behalf of another person (like the car owner) might not be valid unless the car owner is a minor. Since the author is an adult, the parents can't unilaterally decide for them. Therefore, the author's parents might not have the legal authority to waive the author's right to compensation. In that case, the author is not in the wrong for seeking reimbursement. \n\nHowever, socially, the parents might have tried to handle it amicably, and the author coming back and demanding money could cause a rift. But the author's right to their property and the actual financial burden they're facing are valid. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They have a right to seek compensation for damages to their property, especially if the initial resolution wasn't done with their consent. The parents might have acted without the owner's permission, which could be the issue here. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
