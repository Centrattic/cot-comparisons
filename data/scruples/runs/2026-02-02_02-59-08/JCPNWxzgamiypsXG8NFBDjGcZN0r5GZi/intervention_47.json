Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's kid hit their parked car while they were abroad, causing $1,000 in damage. The parents were there and let it go, but the owner found out about the damage after returning and is upset they didn't get compensation.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author is at fault here. The key points are: the kid was 16, hit the car, parents were present, and the author's parents didn't mention it. The author is now upset because he had to pay for the repairs and feels the neighbor should reimburse him. But everyone else says he's overreacting.\n\nLegal perspective: In most places, when someone's property is damaged, the responsible party is liable. The kid's parents might be responsible since he's a minor. So the author has a right to seek compensation. But the parents of the kid might have already resolved it by apologizing and offering payment, but the author's parents dismissed it.\n\nHowever, the author's parents were the ones present and let it go. They didn't inform their child when he came back. The author is now being blamed because his parents didn't handle it. But the author didn't know about the incident until he returned. Is it fair for him to expect reimbursement when his own parents didn't take action?\n\nEthically, the owner has the right to know about damage to their property. The parents might have been wrong to not inform the author and to not ensure compensation. The author isn't at fault for the accident itself. The main issue is whether the parents' inaction makes the author responsible.\n\nIn many cases, people might say that once the parents handled the situation (apology and offer to pay), the author's parents accepted it, so there's no issue. But the author's parents might have been too lenient. However, the author didn't know and is now being blamed for asking for money. \n\nSo from a legal standpoint, the responsible party (the kid's parents) should cover the damages. The author's parents might have been wrong to not inform their son and to not enforce compensation. The author isn't at fault for the accident, but maybe for not being aware of the situation until later? No, the parents should have informed him. \n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong. The main issue is the parents' inaction. The answer would be B (No).\n"
