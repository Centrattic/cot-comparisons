Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit their parked car, causing $1k damage. The parents were informed but told not to worry about it. The author is upset because he wasn't told and there's no compensation.\n\nFirst, legal responsibility. In most places, if someone damages your property, they're liable. The kid is a minor, so his parents would likely be responsible. Even if the parents said not to worry, that doesn't absolve them legally. The author has a right to seek reimbursement regardless of the parents' initial reaction.\n\nThen, communication. The parents knew about the damage but didn't inform the car owner. The author didn't know until returning. That's a problem because he was out of town. The parents might have tried to handle it, but the author has the right to know about the damage to his property.\n\nEmotional aspect. The author is frustrated because he's being told to just let it go. But he's the one who had to pay for repairs. The neighbors didn't have to pay anything. It's not unreasonable for him to seek compensation. The neighbors, especially the parents, should have informed him and handled the costs.\n\nSocial dynamics. The neighbors might feel that the parents already handled it by the kid apologizing. But the parents didn't actually cover the costs. The author isn't the asshole for wanting to be reimbursed. It's about fairness and responsibility.\n\nSo, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong. The neighbors are responsible for the damage, and he's justified in seeking compensation. The parents shouldn't have dismissed the issue without resolving it properly.\n"
