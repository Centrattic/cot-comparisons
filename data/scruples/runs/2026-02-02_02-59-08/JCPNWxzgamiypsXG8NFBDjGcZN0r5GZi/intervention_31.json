Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're the asshole after their neighbor's kid hit their parked car while they were abroad. The kid's parents were there, and they were told not to worry about it. Now the author is upset because they didn't get compensation and people are saying they're overreacting.\n\nFirst, the car was parked at their parents' house. So maybe the parents had some role in handling it. The kid is 16, so a minor. When the parents were approached, they told them not to worry. The kid offered to pay, but the parents dismissed it. Now the author comes back and finds out about the damage. They're upset because they weren't informed and didn't get reimbursed.\n\nThe author is arguing that the kid should reimburse them. But the parents already said it's okay. The kid apologized. So, legally, if the parents (with the kid) were informed and the issue was resolved by the parents, maybe the author's parents had already waived the right to compensation. The author wasn't there, so maybe they should have known to check on the car or maybe it's their parents' responsibility since the car was at their house. Also, in some places, parents are responsible for their minor's actions, so maybe the author could have pursued a claim through the kid's parents. But since the parents said not to worry, maybe the author is overstepping now by coming back and demanding money. \n\nBut the author's parents might have been in a different time zone, so maybe they couldn't inform the author immediately. But the author's parents might have made a decision without consulting them. The kid's family might have been advised to pay, but they didn't. So maybe the author's parents were complicit in not following through. The author is now being told they're the asshole for asking for reimbursement after the fact. \n\nLegally, if the damage happened and the responsible party was told to pay but didn't, the victim (author) might have a right to claim. However, since the author's parents were present and dismissed the issue, maybe they're part of the problem. The author might be right to seek compensation, but the way they're approaching it after the fact could be seen as unreasonable if their parents already handled it. Alternatively, the author's parents might have made a mistake in not ensuring compensation.\n\nSo, considering all that, is the author in the wrong? The author wasn't there, but maybe they should have trusted their parents' handling of the situation. But the parents might have been too quick to let it go. The kid's family might have known they should pay but were pressured not to by the author's parents. The author's anger is valid because they have to bear the cost. But if the parents already said it's okay, maybe the author is overreacting. Hmm. It's a bit of a gray area. I think the author is not in the wrong because they're the victim here, but maybe they should have been more involved. However, the answer might depend on local laws regarding responsibility for minor's actions. If the parents (author's) dismissed it, but the kid's parents should have covered it, the author's stance is justified. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
