Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the author (the person who posted the scenario) is in the wrong. The key points here are about responsibility and communication.\n\nFirst, the neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit the author's car. The kid and his mom approached the author's parents to resolve it. The parents told them not to worry about it, didn't inform the author, and accepted an apology. Now the author returns to find damage and no compensation, feeling upset.\n\nSo, is the author wrong for wanting reimbursement? From a legal standpoint, the kid caused damage, so the parent might be liable as the guardian. However, the parents already handled it by saying not to worry, and the author's parents didn't inform him. But the author didn't know about the incident until returning. \n\nThe author's parents might have intended to resolve it without involving the other family, but they didn't communicate with their son. The author is now being told by everyone to accept it, but he's being blamed for overreacting. \n\nLegally, the author might have a right to claim damages, but since his parents already resolved it, there's a conflict. The author's parents' actions could have waived the claim. However, the author wasn't consulted, so he's in a bind. \n\nMost people would think it's reasonable for the author to expect compensation since the damage was caused. The fact that his parents didn't inform him and dismissed it might be the real issue here. The author isn't in the wrong for seeking reimbursement after discovering the damage. So the answer is B.\n"
