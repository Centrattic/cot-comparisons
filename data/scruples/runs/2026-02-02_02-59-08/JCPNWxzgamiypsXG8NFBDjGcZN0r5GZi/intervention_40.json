Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves a neighbor's kid hitting their parked car and causing $1,000 in damage. The parents were present when the incident happened, the kid apologized and offered to pay, but the parents were told not to worry about it. Now the author is upset because they weren't informed and aren't getting compensation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. If the car was parked on private property (like the parent's house), then the responsibility might lie with the property owner. But the car belongs to the author, so there's an argument there. The kid is a minor, so liability might fall on the parents. However, the parents might have resolved the issue informally, thinking it was handled. \n\nIn many places, if someone causes damage, the owner has the right to seek compensation. The parents might have thought it was a friendly gesture to let it go, but the author is now out of pocket. The parents might not have informed the author because they thought it was resolved, but that's not their fault. The author's issue is about not being informed and not getting compensation for their own property. \n\nThe key points are: the author's property was damaged, the parents didn't inform them, and the other party's family was told not to worry. The author is upset about financial loss. Legally, the author has a right to seek reimbursement. However, the parents might have resolved it, but maybe not properly. The author isn't in the wrong for seeking reimbursement for their own damages. The other side might have been negligent. So the answer is B.\n"
