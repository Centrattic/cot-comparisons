Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that a 16-year-old neighbor hit their parked car while they were abroad. The parents were there and the kid and his mother approached them. The parents said not to worry about it, and the kid offered to pay but was told it's okay. Now the car owner comes back and is upset because he wasn't informed and isn't getting compensation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. If the parents of the kid are in a position where they can cover the damages, maybe they should have insisted on compensation. But the parents might have resolved it amicably, assuming that the kid's parents would handle it. However, the car owner wasn't informed and now has to pay for the damage. Legally, the driver (the kid) or his parents might be liable for damages. If the parents handled the situation without informing the car owner, maybe they should have made sure the payment was arranged.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the car owner isn't at fault for seeking reimbursement. He wasn't part of the initial conversation, so he's reacting to a problem that was already there. The parents might have made a mistake by dismissing the issue. The kid is underage, so his parents are responsible. The author is upset about not being informed and not getting compensation, which is reasonable. The people telling him to \"forget it\" might be downplaying his legitimate financial loss.\n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong for wanting reimbursement. He's the victim here. The parents and the kid's family might be at fault for not informing him and not compensating him. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
