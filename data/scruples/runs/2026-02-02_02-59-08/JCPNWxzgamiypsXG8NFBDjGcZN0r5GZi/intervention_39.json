Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves a neighbor's kid damaging their car while they were away. The parents were present and told the kid and his mother not to worry about it, even though the kid offered to pay. The author returns to find the damage and wants reimbursement. Others think he's being unreasonable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. In many places, if someone damages another person's property, they're liable for the damage. The kid is a minor, so his parents would typically be responsible. However, the parents in this case were the ones who dismissed the issue and told the author's parents not to pursue it. The author didn't know about the damage until he returned, so he wasn't in a position to handle it directly.\n\nLegally, the car owner should be informed when their property is damaged. The parents (the author's parents) might have acted without consulting the actual owner (the author), which could be an issue. The parents might have overstepped by not informing the author and resolving it without his input.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the kid did cause damage, and the author is being asked to bear the cost. The parents (both the neighbor and the author's) might have downplayed the situation, but the author is upset because he's the one facing the financial burden. The neighbor's parents might have a responsibility here since their child caused the damage and they were present during the incident.\n\nHowever, the neighbor's parents did say that the kid apologized and offered to pay, but the author's parents waved it off. The author is now upset because he wasn't informed. Did the parents have the authority to make that decision? If the car is owned by the author, his parents shouldn't have made a decision about compensation without his consent. That could be a factor in why the author is upset.\n\nOn the other hand, the author wasn't there, so maybe his parents acted in good faith to prevent a conflict. But the fact that they didn't inform him later is problematic. The author is justified in wanting to know about the damage and seeking reimbursement, especially if the parents didn't have the right to dismiss it.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's tricky. Legally, the neighbor might be liable, but the author's parents made a decision that affected him. The author's anger stems from not being informed and not being compensated. The neighbor's parents should have informed the car owner (the author) and handled the claim properly. The author isn't the one who caused the damage, so he's not at fault. However, if the parents had the authority to handle it and the neighbor's family agreed, maybe there's a different angle. But since the author wasn't informed, and the parents acted without his knowledge, it's more likely they acted without considering his rights as the car owner.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The neighbor and their parents might be, but the author's parents also made a mistake by not informing him and not involving him in the decision. The author is justified in wanting reimbursement because the damage was done to his property without his knowledge or consent.\n"
