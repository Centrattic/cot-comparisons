Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's kid hit their parked car while they were away. The parents were informed and told the kid's parents not to worry about it. Now the author is upset because he wasn't informed and wants reimbursement. He's being told by others he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If the kid is a minor, parents are usually responsible for damages. But in this case, the parents were there and addressed it. The author's parents dismissed the issue, so maybe there's no legal obligation to compensate. Legally, maybe the case is closed once the parents said it's okay.\n\nThen there's the moral side. The author is out $1,000. But he wasn't present. His parents made a decision. The kid apologized and offered to pay, but the parents accepted the apology. So maybe the author's parents are the ones who let it go. The author is now upset because he wasn't involved in the decision. But was he the legal owner of the car? If so, maybe he has a right to know and to seek compensation. However, since his parents were handling it and they said not to worry, maybe the author is overstepping by coming back and demanding money. \n\nAlso, the kid's parents might have resolved it by accepting the apology. The author's parents might have considered the damage minor. But the author is now facing the financial burden. However, others think he's the asshole because the situation was already dealt with by the parents. So maybe the author is being unreasonable now that he's back. \n\nIn some jurisdictions, if the car owner wasn't present, the damages would be the responsibility of the parents. But since the parents already resolved it, the author might not have a strong case. So the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong because the parents settled it and he's now upset about a decision they made.\n"
