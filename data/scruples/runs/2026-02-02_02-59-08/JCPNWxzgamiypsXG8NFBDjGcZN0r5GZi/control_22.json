Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's kid hit their car while they were abroad, and now they're upset because they weren't told and aren't getting reimbursed. \n\nFirst, I need to consider legal and social norms. Legally, if someone damages another person's property, they're usually responsible for covering the costs. The kid was 16, so his parents might be legally responsible since he's a minor. The fact that the parents were involved when the accident happened is important. \n\nThe author's parents were there and spoke to the neighbors. They told them not to worry about it, which might have implied they weren't going to pursue compensation. But the author wasn't informed about the damage until returning, which is a problem. The author is now facing unexpected costs.\n\nSocially, the neighbors might feel that the author's parents had already resolved the issue, so the author coming in later to ask for money could be seen as complicating things. However, the author isn't in the wrong for seeking reimbursement since they're the car owner. The parents might have made a decision without considering that the author would be the one to pay for the repairs.\n\nAlso, the kid did apologize and offered to pay, but the parents were against any action. The author wasn't consulted, so they're being asked to accept a situation that wasn't their fault. The key points are responsibility for the damage and whether the author is justified in seeking compensation.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because the damage wasn't their fault, and they have a right to be compensated. Their parents might have handled it without their knowledge, but that doesn't make the author at fault. The neighbors, especially the kid's family, should cover the costs. So the answer should be B.\n"
