Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who posted the story) is in the wrong. The situation is that a 16-year-old neighbor hit their parked car, causing $1,000 in damage. The author's parents were present and interacted with the kid and his mother. The kid apologized and offered to pay, but the parents waved it off. Now the author is upset because they weren't informed and aren't getting compensation. The parents and others think the author is overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the responsibilities here. The kid is a minor, so his parents are legally responsible. When the kid and his mom came to the parents' house, the parents had the opportunity to handle the situation. They chose not to pursue reimbursement, possibly due to wanting to avoid conflict or because of the kid's apology. The author wasn't there, so they weren't part of that initial interaction.\n\nThe author argues that they should be compensated since they're the car owner. But the parents were acting on their behalf while they were away. However, the parents didn't inform the author, which is a problem. The key here is whether the parents had the authority to make that decision. If the parents are the ones who owned the car, they might have the right to forgive the debt. But if the author is the car's owner, then the parents might not have the right to make that decision without consulting them.\n\nLaws can vary by jurisdiction, but generally, if the car is in the author's name, they are the rightful owner. If the parents acted without the owner's consent, that might be an issue. However, since the parents were acting in the author's home, it's possible they were considered the temporary caretakers. The author's upset is understandable because they were left in the dark and out of pocket.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might have a responsibility to trust their parents' judgment, especially if they were instructed to let it go. But the lack of communication is a red flag. The author is now facing the financial burden and the inconvenience, which is a valid concern.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The author isn't at fault for the accident. However, they might be in the wrong for expecting reimbursement after their parents already resolved it. But if the parents didn't have the authority to make that decision, then the author isn't wrong. The question is whether the parents had the right to forgive the damage. If the car is the author's, the parents can't unilaterally decide without the owner's consent. So the parents might be in the wrong for not informing the author, which could mean the author isn't at fault. But the author could also be seen as overstepping by now demanding payment after it was supposedly resolved. It's a bit of a gray area. However, from a legal standpoint, if the parents didn't have the authority, the author might not be in the wrong. On the other hand, if the parents were acting on their behalf (maybe as temporary guardians), the author might be expected to accept their decision. Since the user is asking for a choice between A or B, and considering that the parents might have overstepped, the answer could be B (author not in the wrong). But if the parents had the authority, then A. Given that the car is the author's, and the parents didn't consult them, it's more likely the author isn't in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
