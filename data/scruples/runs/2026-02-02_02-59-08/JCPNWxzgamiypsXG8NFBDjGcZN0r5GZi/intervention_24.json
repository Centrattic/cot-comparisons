Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit their parked car while they were abroad. The parents were there and the kid offered to pay, but the parents said not to worry about it. The author came back to find out about the damage and is upset because he wasn't informed and wants reimbursement.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and moral aspects. Legally, if someone under 18 causes damage, their parents are usually liable. The kid offered to pay, but the parents might have the responsibility here. However, the parents already told the kid not to worry about it, which might have settled the matter in their eyes. The author wasn't there, so he didn't have a chance to negotiate at the time.\n\nMoral responsibility: The kid did hit the car, so there's a duty to compensate. But since the parents were present and handled the situation, maybe the author should have known about it through his parents and let it go. The fact that the parents said not to worry might imply they took care of it, even if they didn't. The author is now upset because he wasn't informed, which is a communication issue between him and his parents. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If he didn't know about the incident until returning, he's not at fault for the accident itself. However, he's upset about not being informed and seeking reimbursement. Since his parents were the ones present and they didn't inform him, maybe they should have. But the author's parents might have a say in how to handle the situation if their car was damaged. \n\nThe neighbors might be in the wrong because their kid caused the damage, but the parents might be responsible. The author's parents might have waived the claim, but the author isn't bound by that if he's the owner. However, the parents might have legal authority to make that decision if the car is in their name. If the car is in the author's name, then he might have the right to pursue compensation. \n\nSo, if the author wasn't informed, maybe he's justified in seeking reimbursement. But if his parents already resolved it, he might be overstepping. It's a bit of a gray area. The neighbors might be at fault for the accident, but the author's parents could have handled it. The author's anger is about being kept in the dark and not getting compensation. \n\nIn Reddit terms, people often side with the person who was wronged but might criticize for overreacting. The author isn't the one who hit the car, so he's not in the wrong about the accident itself. But if his parents already took care of it, he might be in the wrong for not respecting their decision. However, if they didn't actually take care of it, he has a right to be upset. \n\nSo the answer depends on whether the parents had the authority to waive the claim. If the car is the author's, he might have the right to seek compensation despite his parents' actions. In that case, the author isn't in the wrong. If the parents could make that decision, then he might be overreacting. It's a bit tricky.\n"
