Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit their parked car while they were in Germany. The kid and his mom went to the parent's house, apologized, and offered to pay, but the parents said not to worry about it. The author comes back and is upset about the $1000 damage and is being told by everyone that he's the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are that the parents already handled the situation by declining compensation. The kid took responsibility and offered to pay, but the parents forgave it. The author is now upset because he wasn't informed and there's no compensation. But legally, if the parents are the car owner, they can decide not to seek compensation. Since the author wasn't the one who dealt with the incident, maybe he didn't have the right to ask later. However, morally, the kid did cause damage and the author is now facing the financial loss. But since the parents already resolved it, the author's anger might be misplaced. The community might see him as overreacting because the issue was already settled. But maybe the parents should've informed him. Wait, he was abroad, so maybe they had the right to handle it. The answer might depend on whether the parents had legal authority to forgive the debt and if the author should have been notified. But in terms of right or wrong, if the parents said not to worry about it, then the kid's responsibility was addressed. The author's demand for reimbursement now could be seen as going against the parents' decision, hence him being the asshole. So answer A.\n"
