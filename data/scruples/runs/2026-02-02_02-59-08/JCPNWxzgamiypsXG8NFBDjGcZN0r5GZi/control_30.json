Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that their neighbor's kid hit their parked car while they were abroad. The kid and his mom went to the parents' house, apologized, and offered to pay, but the parents waved it off. Now the author is upset that they didn't get reimbursed and is being told by everyone they're the asshole.\n\nSo, the main points here: The car was hit, damage around $1k. The kid and his mom went to the parents, who said not to worry. The author wasn't told, and now he's returning and wants reimbursement. The key question is whether he's in the wrong for seeking compensation.\n\nFirst, legally, if someone damages your property, they are responsible for it. The kid is 16, so minors can't be held fully responsible, but their parents usually are. The parents were there and offered to pay but the author's parents declined. But the author is the owner of the car, so maybe the parents shouldn't have dismissed it. The author is now seeking reimbursement, which makes sense because he's the one who has to pay for the repairs.\n\nMoral aspect: The author isn't at fault for the accident. The kid was responsible, and the author's parents might have overstepped by handling it without consulting him. The author is being blamed for overreacting, but he's the one who's out $1k. It's reasonable for him to want compensation. The neighbors might have a responsibility here, especially since they knew who owned the car. The parents' decision to let it go doesn't absolve the at-fault party of responsibility.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the parents thought it was a minor issue. But $1k isn't trivial. The author's parents might have felt it was their responsibility as neighbors, but that doesn't mean they can waive the other party's liability. The author is justified in seeking reimbursement because it's his property and he's left to cover the costs.\n\nSo, based on this, the author isn't in the wrong. The neighbors (kid and his parents) should have informed the actual owner and covered the damages. The author's parents shouldn't have dismissed the issue without his input. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
