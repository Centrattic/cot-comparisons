Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this situation. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The scenario is about a neighbor's kid damaging their car while they were abroad, and the parents not informing them or getting compensation.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The kid hit the car, then went to the parent's house. The parents said not to worry about it, so the kid apologized and maybe said he'd pay, but no action was taken. The author returns and finds out about the damage, which costs $1k. They're upset because they weren't informed and aren't getting compensation. Others are telling them to let it go, but the author feels wronged.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. The kid's parents were present when the accident happened. The parents of the author and the kid's parents interacted. The author's parents told them not to worry, which might have been a mistake. The author is now being blamed for being the asshole for asking for reimbursement later. \n\nFrom a legal perspective, when someone's property is damaged, the responsible party should compensate the owner. Here, the kid is at fault. However, the parents of the kid were involved and perhaps let their son off the hook. The author's parents might have mistakenly dismissed the issue. The author is now seeking reimbursement, which is their right as the car owner. \n\nBut the problem here is that the parents of the kid were involved and maybe made a decision to not pursue compensation. So is the author in the wrong for later coming back and asking for money? Or is it the kid's parents who didn't inform them? \n\nThe user is asking if the author is the asshole. If the parents of the kid and the author's parents resolved the issue by not pressing charges, but the author wasn't part of that agreement, then the author might have a right to question it. However, if the parents were acting on behalf of the author (as a parent), then maybe not. But in this case, the author was abroad and not part of the conversation. \n\nSo, the author's parents might have overstepped by not informing their child. If the author wasn't involved in the initial resolution, then it's possible they have grounds to ask for reimbursement. The kid's parents might be at fault for not following through, and the author's parents for not informing them. \n\nIn terms of morality, the responsible party (the kid) should pay for damages. If the parents of the kid agreed to that but didn't follow through, then the author is justified in seeking compensation. The author is not the asshole because they are the rightful owner of the car and have the right to be compensated. The ones who failed were the parents of the kid and the author's parents for not informing the author. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
