Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the neighbor's kid hit the author's parked car while the author was away. The kid and his parents went to the author's parents' house and apologized, and the parents said not to worry about it. The author comes back, sees the damage, and is upset because no one told him and there's no compensation. Now he's asking if he's the asshole for wanting reimbursement.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, if someone damages your property, they can be liable for the damages. The kid is 16, so maybe his parents are responsible as they're the legal guardians. The parents might have agreed to cover the cost, but instead, they said not to worry about it. So the author didn't get any compensation. But since the author wasn't there, maybe there was an assumption that the parents would handle it, and they didn't. \n\nThen there's the social aspect. The parents of the kid might not want to involve the police or insurance, which could affect their insurance rates. So they might have downplayed the situation. The author's parents also agreed not to make a fuss. But the author is now being told he's overreacting. Is it fair for the author to expect compensation? Well, legally, he might have a case, but socially, maybe the resolution was agreed upon without his knowledge. \n\nThe key points here are: 1. The author wasn't informed. 2. The parents of the kid and the author's parents agreed to let it go. 3. The author is now upset about not being told and not getting compensation. \n\nIs the author wrong? If the parents already had an agreement, maybe he's out of line to demand more now. But if the parents shouldn't have made that decision without consulting him, then he's not at fault. Also, the kid is a minor, so the parents have responsibility. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because he's the owner of the car and has a right to know and be reimbursed. The fact that the parents resolved it without his input might be the issue. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
