Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that a neighbor's kid hit their parked car while they were abroad. The parents were there and had a conversation with the kid and his mom. The parents said not to worry about it, and the kid offered to pay but was told it's okay. Now the author comes back, finds out about the damage, and wants reimbursement. But everyone's telling him he's the asshole for asking.\n\nFirst, the kid was at fault for hitting the car. At 16, he's a minor, so his parents would be responsible. The kid did apologize and offered to pay, which shows some accountability. The parents were upset about getting in trouble or filing a claim. The author's parents, who were present, said not to worry. That's a key point. They might have resolved it on the spot, maybe thinking it's a good lesson or to avoid insurance issues. But the author came back and wanted money. \n\nThe problem here is that the author wasn't present. His parents handled the situation, and maybe they made a decision that the author isn't happy with. So is the author in the wrong for expecting reimbursement when his parents already told the other party to forget it? The neighbors might think they've resolved the issue, so the author coming back and asking for money could be seen as double-dipping or not respecting his parents' decision. \n\nBut then again, the author is the car's owner. His parents might not have the authority to waive his right to compensation. If the kid is at fault, the parents should be responsible for the damages. But since the author's parents already told the other parents not to worry about it, maybe there's an understanding that the matter is settled. The author might feel wronged because he wasn't informed and now has to pay out of pocket. \n\nReddit users might split here. Some would say the author is in the wrong because his parents handled it and he shouldn't be mad now. Others might say the parents overstepped and the author is justified in seeking reimbursement. But according to the question, the answer is either A or B. Considering that the author's parents had the authority to make that decision, the author might not have a valid claim now. So the answer could be A, he's in the wrong. But maybe the parents didn't have the right to waive his claim, making the answer B. Hmm, tricky. I think the parents might have acted on behalf of the owner (the author) since they were there, but if the author wasn't consulted, maybe they shouldn't have. But in terms of legal responsibility, the kid's parents should have covered it. So the author is not in the wrong because the kid is responsible. Therefore, answer B.\n"
