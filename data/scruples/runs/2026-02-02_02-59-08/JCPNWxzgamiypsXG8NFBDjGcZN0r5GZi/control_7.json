Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author left their car at their parents' house while they were in Germany for three months. A neighbor kid, 16 years old, hit the car. The kid and his mom went to the parents' house and offered to pay, but the parents said not to worry about it. The author comes back, finds out about the $1000 damage, and is upset because no one told him and there's no compensation. Now, the author is asking if they're the asshole for wanting reimbursement.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, when someone causes damage to a car, the responsible party is liable for the repairs. The kid is a minor, so his parents would be legally responsible. But the parents already told the kid's family to not worry about it. The parents handled it, but maybe they should have informed the actual car owner (the author) about the incident, right? The author wasn't there and didn't know. So maybe the parents failed to communicate with the owner.\n\nThen there's the question of responsibility. The kid's family offered to pay, but the parents (the author's parents) said no. But the car belongs to the author, so they might have the right to decide about compensation. However, the parents might not have thought to inform their child (the author) because they thought they handled it. But the author's parents are the ones who had the car in their possession, so maybe they had a duty to inform the owner about the damage and the offer of compensation.\n\nAnother point is that the author is being told to just let it go because the kid apologized and it's a minor thing. But the cost is significant ($1000), and the author is out of pocket. The neighbors might not have the money, but if the parents had insurance, maybe they could have filed a claim. However, the author's parents didn't do that either. So the author is left with the bill and no way to get it back.\n\nIs the author wrong to be upset? Well, the damage wasn't their fault. The kid's family was at fault, and the author's parents' decision not to pursue compensation might have been a mistake. The author is the actual owner, so they should have the right to decide how to handle the damages. If the parents decided not to ask for money, maybe they should have informed the author, but they didn't. So the author is in a tough spot because they weren't part of the decision.\n\nBut does that make the author in the wrong? The author is just asking for reimbursement for something they didn't cause. The kid's family did the damage, so the author isn't the one at fault. The parents might be the ones who mishandled the situation by not informing the author and not following through on compensation. So the author isn't the asshole here. The answer would be B, No.\n"
