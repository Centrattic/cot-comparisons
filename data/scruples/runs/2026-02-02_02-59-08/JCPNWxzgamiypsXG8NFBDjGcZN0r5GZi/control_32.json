Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So, the user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor kid hit their car while they were in Germany, causing $1k damage. The kid and his parents went to the parents' house, apologized, and offered to pay, but the parents said not to worry about it. Now the author is upset because they weren't informed and there's no compensation. People are saying the author is the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author is wrong here. Let's break it down. The kid was at fault for hitting the car. The parents of the author didn't inform the author about the incident. The neighbor tried to resolve it but was told to forget it. Now the author is seeking reimbursement, but everyone thinks they're overreacting.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if a minor causes damage, their parents are usually responsible. The fact that the neighbor offered to pay but was dissuaded by the author's parents complicates things. If the parents accepted the apology and declined compensation, maybe the author's parents are absolving them of responsibility. However, the author wasn't consulted, and the car is their property. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author wasn't informed, which is a problem. But the parents might have considered it resolved. The author is now trying to claim reimbursement, but maybe they should have been informed before any resolution. However, the parents might have made a decision without the owner's consent. \n\nEmotionally, the author is upset about the financial loss. But if the parents already handled it by accepting the apology and refusing payment, maybe the author shouldn't be seeking reimbursement now. However, the parents might not have the authority to absolve the debt, especially if the car is the author's. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They are seeking compensation that their parents didn't accept. But maybe they have a right to be informed about the damage to their property. The neighbor's family might have thought it was resolved because the parents said so, but the author's parents might not have the right to make that decision on behalf of the author. \n\nThis seems like a gray area. If the parents were acting as intermediaries and didn't have the authority to absolve the debt, then the author is justified. But if the parents had the authority, maybe the author is wrong to seek it now. However, the author was not informed, which is a key issue. \n\nI think the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong because the damage was done to their property without their knowledge, and the resolution was made without their consent. The neighbor's family might have thought it was resolved, but the author's parents might not have the right to do that. So the answer is B.\n"
