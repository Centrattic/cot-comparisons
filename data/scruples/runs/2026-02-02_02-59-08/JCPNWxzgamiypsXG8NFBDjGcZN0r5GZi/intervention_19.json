Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit their parked car while they were abroad, causing $1k damage. The parents were informed by the kid and his mom, but the writer's parents told them it's okay and not to worry. The writer is upset because he finds out later and wants reimbursement, but everyone says he's the asshole for asking.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal perspective. In many places, if someone's property is damaged, the responsible party is liable for repairs. The kid is a minor, so his parents would be responsible. The parents were told about the damage and maybe even offered to pay, but the writer's parents dismissed it. Now the original car owner is upset because he wasn't informed and expects compensation.\n\nBut the writer's parents told the neighbor parents not to worry about it. So maybe the writer is now going against what his parents did. If the parents already resolved it by accepting the apology and not pressing charges, the writer coming back and demanding reimbursement could be seen as going back on an agreement made by his parents. However, the writer wasn't present and wasn't consulted. So is the writer in the wrong for expecting compensation?\n\nAnother angle is that the writer's parents might have forgiven the debt, but the writer is now trying to enforce it. That could be seen as unfair because the parents already let it go. On the other hand, the writer wasn't involved in the initial decision, so maybe he's justified in seeking what he's owed.\n\nAlso, the kid did offer to pay, but the writer's parents refused. So the responsibility might have been waived by the parents. Now the writer is challenging that. If the parents have legal authority over the car (since the writer was away), their decision to not pursue compensation might be binding.\n\nBut the writer is the car's owner. So even though his parents are acting on his behalf, maybe he has the right to decide later. However, since the parents already resolved it, his sudden demand could be seen as unreasonable. The neighbors might feel they were already made to fix the problem in a way acceptable to the parents, so the writer's insistence is causing more conflict.\n\nIn terms of social norms, if the parents said \"don't worry about it,\" others might think the writer is overreacting. But the writer is being asked to cover unexpected costs, which is a valid concern. The key points are whether the parents had the authority to forgive the debt and whether the writer is now acting against an agreement they were part of.\n\nSo, considering all this, if the parents accepted the apology and refused to take any action, the writer's decision to now seek reimbursement might be seen as going against the resolution already made. That could make him the asshole for changing his parents' decision and putting the neighbors in a tough spot. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
