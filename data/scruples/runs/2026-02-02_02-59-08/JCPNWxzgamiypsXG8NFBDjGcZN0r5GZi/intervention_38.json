Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's kid hit their parked car while they were abroad. The parents were present and told the kid's parents not to worry about it, but the owner didn't know about the damage until returning. Now, the owner is upset and wants reimbursement, but everyone else thinks he's overreacting.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are: the kid caused damage, the parents didn't inform the owner, and the owner is now seeking compensation. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, if someone damages your property, they're responsible for covering the costs. The kid is 16, so the parents would typically be responsible for any compensation. But the parents were told by the neighbor's parents to not worry about it, which might be their way of trying to avoid liability. However, not informing the actual owner of the car (the author) could be an issue. If the parents have authority to waive the claim, then maybe the author's case is weaker. But if they don't, then the author might have a right to seek compensation.\n\nThen there's the social aspect. The parents might have thought it was a minor issue or didn't want to create a conflict. The kid apologized, so there's an acknowledgment of fault. But the author is now out $1,000 due to no fault of his own. The fact that no one told him and he's being criticized for seeking reimbursement adds to the conflict.\n\nOn one hand, the author's parents might have resolved the issue in a way they thought was best, but perhaps didn't consider the owner's perspective. On the other hand, the author is now facing the financial burden because he didn't know. So, is he in the wrong for expecting compensation when his parents already told the other party not to worry about it?\n\nIf the parents had legal authority to settle the matter, then the author might not have a case. But if they didn't, then the author could be justified. The line here is whether the parents can make that decision for the car's owner. Since the car is the author's, maybe the parents overstepped by not consulting him. However, in some cases, immediate family members might handle such matters on behalf of others, but it's not always clear.\n\nAlso, the kid's parents might have been assured that the matter was resolved, so if the author is now coming back and seeking payment, it could be seen as going back on a previous agreement. But if the agreement was made without the owner's knowledge, that could be problematic.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. Legally, the person who caused the damage (the kid) is at fault, so the responsibility lies with their parents. However, if the author's parents dismissed the claim, maybe the author is now out of luck. But if the parents didn't have the authority to do that, then the author isn't in the wrong.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might hinge on whether the parents could legally agree to no compensation without the owner's consent. If they couldn't, then the author isn't in the wrong. If they could, then he might be. But in many jurisdictions, the owner of the property (the car) is the one who can decide on compensation, so the parents might not have the right to waive that. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for seeking reimbursement.\n"
