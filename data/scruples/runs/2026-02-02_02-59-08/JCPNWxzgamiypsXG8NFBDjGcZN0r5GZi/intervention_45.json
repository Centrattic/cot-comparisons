Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's kid hit their parked car while they were abroad. The parents were present and told the kid and his mom not to worry about it, even though the kid offered to pay. Now the author is upset because they weren't informed and no compensation was given.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the responsibilities here. The kid hit the car, which is an accident. In many places, the at-fault party is responsible for damages, especially if they're a minor. But since the parents were involved, they might have a role in handling the situation. The author's own parents were there when the incident happened and chose to let it go, even though the kid apologized and offered to pay. The author's parents might have thought it was a minor issue or didn't want to create conflict. \n\nNow, the author returns after two months to find the damage and is upset. They argue that the kid should reimburse them. But the parents and others think the author is overreacting. The key points here are whether the parents had the authority to waive the claim, and if the author is justified in seeking compensation now.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the car owner (the author) wasn't present, their parents might not have the legal right to settle the claim on their behalf. However, since the author's parents were acting as their proxies, maybe there's an assumption of forgiveness. But in terms of morality, the kid caused damage and should take responsibility. The fact that the kid offered to pay suggests he acknowledges fault, but the parents let it go. \n\nThe author is now upset because they didn't know and had to pay for repairs. Is it fair for them to seek reimbursement now? If the parents accepted the apology and dismissed the claim, maybe the author doesn't have standing. However, the parents might not have had the right to do that without consulting the owner. \n\nSo, the debate is between the author's right to seek compensation versus the parents' decision to let it go. Legally, if the parents didn't have authority, the author could still pursue it. Morally, the kid and parents should have informed the car owner and covered the costs. But since the parents were present and dismissed it, there's a gray area. \n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate whether the author has a legitimate claim. If the parents had the authority to waive the claim, then the author is wrong to pursue it. If not, then the author is justified. Since the parents were acting on the author's behalf (as the car is the author's), maybe they didn't have the right to waive the claim. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for seeking reimbursement. \n\nBut the parents might have thought it's a small matter. However, the author is now facing a significant expense. The author's reaction is about not being informed and not getting compensation. The neighbors had a duty to inform the rightful owner. So the author is not in the wrong for seeking reimbursement.\n"
