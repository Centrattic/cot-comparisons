Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's kid hit their parked car while they were abroad. The parents were present and the kid offered to pay, but the parents said not to worry. Now, when the author returns, they're upset about the $1,000 damage and want reimbursement.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the legal and ethical responsibilities here. Legally, if someone causes damage to another's property, they are generally responsible for covering the costs. The fact that the parents were there and the kid apologized but didn't follow through on compensation might be a point. However, in many jurisdictions, once the parents and the person responsible have resolved the matter without the owner's knowledge, it becomes complicated. The parents might have authority to make such a decision if they believed the car was theirs or if there was a misunderstanding.\n\nEthically, the author's frustration is understandable because they were unaware of the incident and are now facing financial loss. However, the parents might have considered the situation resolved out of good faith or to avoid conflict. The key issue here is whether the parents had the authority to forgive the debt. If the car is the author's, then the parents might not have the right to waive the claim. But if the car is under the parents' name, they could have more authority. The story says the car was parked at the parent's house, so maybe the parents own the car. Wait, the author says it's their car, parked at the parent's house. So the parents might not be the legal owners. That complicates things.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the kid and his parents caused the damage and should cover the costs. However, the parents of the kid might have settled the matter with the author's parents, who then dismissed the issue. Now the author is upset because they didn't get reimbursement. The author's parents might have overstepped if they weren't the legal owners. If the author's parents were acting as his proxy, maybe they shouldn't have. But if the car is the author's, the parents don't have the authority to forgive the debt without consulting the owner.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is not at fault for seeking reimbursement. The ones at fault would be the kid and his parents for causing the damage and not ensuring proper compensation. The author's parents might be in the wrong for resolving it without the owner's consent. Therefore, the author isn't the asshole here. Answer B.\n"
