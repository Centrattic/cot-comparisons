Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe user left their car parked at their parent's house while they were in Germany for three months. A neighbor's 16-year-old kid backed into the car and caused around $1,000 in damage. The kid and his mom went to the parents' house right after the incident. The parents said not to worry about it, and the kid apologized and offered to pay, but the parents told them it was okay. Now the user comes back, sees the damage, and feels wronged because they weren't informed and didn't get any compensation. People are telling them they're the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n\nHmm. Let's break it down. The kid hit the car. The parents were present at the scene and interacted with the neighbor. The parents of the kid were upset about the possibility of police or a claim, and the user's parents told them not to worry. So, the user's parents handled the situation without involving the car owner (the user). When the user returns, they find out about the damage and are upset about the lack of communication and compensation.\n\nFirst, legal responsibility. If a minor causes damage, typically the parents are liable. The kid offered to pay, but the parents dismissed it. However, the car owner (user) is the one who has to deal with the repair costs. The user's parents might have thought they could handle it, but the user is the rightful owner of the car. So, the user's parents maybe didn't have the authority to waive the claim? They might have overstepped.\n\nThe user didn't know about the incident until they returned. That's a problem because the owner has the right to know about damage to their property. The parents didn't inform them, which could be a breach of trust. The user is now seeking reimbursement, which is their right. The neighbors, especially the kid's family, should be responsible for the damage. The fact that the kid offered to pay but was told not to by his parents doesn't negate the responsibility. The parents might have agreed to cover it, but if they didn't follow through, the user is justified in seeking compensation.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the user's parents felt that since they were the ones who were there, they could handle it amicably. However, the user's property was damaged, and the user has the right to decide how to proceed. The parents didn't consult the user, which is a mistake. The user isn't the asshole for wanting to be reimbursed. The kid's family is responsible, and the user's parents should have informed them about the incident.\n\nSo, the user isn't in the wrong. The neighbors should compensate for the damage, and the user's parents should have informed them. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
