Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit their parked car while they were away. The parents went to the author's parent's house and the kid offered to pay, but the parents said not to worry. Now the author is upset because no one told them about the damage and there's no reimbursement. The question is whether the author is the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the facts. The kid was 16, so a minor. He hit the car, apologized, and offered to pay, but the parents didn't inform the car owner. The author's parents also dismissed the situation. Now the author is coming back and has to deal with the damage without knowing about it. \n\nLegally, when someone causes damage, they are responsible for covering the costs. Even if the parents tried to resolve it, the original owner (the author) has a right to know about the damage and to seek compensation. The fact that the kid is a minor might mean the parents are responsible for any compensation, but the author is still entitled to reimbursement. \n\nSocially, people might say the author is being too harsh because the kid apologized and the parents handled it. But the author didn't know about the damage, which complicates things. The parents might have made a decision without the owner's consent. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the neighbor's family should have informed the car owner about the damage and the potential cost. The author's parents might have made a mistake by not relaying that information. The author is now in a position where they have to pay unexpected expenses, which is understandable. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The author is not at fault because they were away and the damage was done without their knowledge. They have a right to seek reimbursement for something they didn't cause. The neighbor's family and the author's parents might share some blame for not informing the author. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
