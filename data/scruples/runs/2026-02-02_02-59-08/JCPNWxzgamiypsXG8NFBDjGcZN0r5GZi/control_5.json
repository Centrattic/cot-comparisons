Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that their neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit their car while they were away, causing $1,000 damage. The kid and his mom went to their parents' house, and the parents said not to worry about it. The author didn't find out until returning home and is upset about not being informed or compensated. Everyone says they're the asshole for asking for reimbursement now.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the responsibility of the parents, the kid's age, and whether the author has the right to seek reimbursement after the fact.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, parents can be held responsible for their minor children's actions, especially if the child was negligent. The kid is 16, so a minor. The parents might be liable here. The fact that the kid apologized and offered to pay but the parents told them not to worry could mean the parents dismissed the responsibility. However, the car belongs to the author, so they have the right to seek compensation for damages, even if their parents initially waived it. The author wasn't present and didn't have a chance to address the issue themselves while away. The parents might have been wrong to handle it without informing the car owner. Also, the damage is significant, and not getting reimbursement after being hit isn't fair. The author's request for reimbursement isn't unreasonable, especially since they weren't part of the initial conversation. The neighbors might have a responsibility here, but the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to be compensated. So the answer is B.\n"
