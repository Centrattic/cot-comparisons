Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that the neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit the author's parked car while they were away. The parents found out but were told by the neighbor's parents not to worry about it. The author is upset now because they weren't informed and there's no compensation.\n\nHmm, so the author is returning to find the damage and wants reimbursement. The neighbors said the kid apologized and offered to pay, but the parents dismissed it. The author is frustrated because they have to pay for repairs. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion.\n\nI need to consider the legal and moral aspects. Legally, when someone causes damage to property, they are typically responsible for repairs. Since the kid is a minor, the parents might be liable. But the parents were told not to worry, so maybe they didn't follow up. Morally, even if the parents said not to worry, the damage was done without the owner's knowledge. The author is being asked to accept the situation without compensation, but they're in a financial bind.\n\nOn the other hand, the neighbor's family did inform the author's parents, perhaps thinking it was resolved. The author's parents also dismissed it. But the author wasn't informed, which is a problem because they are the car's owner. The parents might have overstepped by not informing their child. The author isn't overreacting because they have to pay the repair costs. The neighbor's kid did the damage, so they should be held accountable. The parents might have mishandled the situation by not ensuring compensation. So the author isn't in the wrong for seeking reimbursement. They were the victim of a hit-and-run, even if it was a minor. The neighbors might be at fault for not following through. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
