Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a neighbor's kid hitting the author's parked car while the author was abroad. The damage is $1,000, but the parents downplayed it, told the kid not to worry, and didn't inform the author. Now the author is upset about the lack of compensation and is being told by others that they're overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The kid was 16, so a minor. The parents were present when the incident happened. They were upset about being asked to pay, but the author's parents initially said not to worry. The kid did apologize and offered to pay, but the author's parents dismissed it. Now the author is returning and finds out about the damage without being informed. The key points here are accountability, communication, and the role of the parents.\n\nIn legal terms, if someone causes damage to your property, they're generally responsible for covering the costs. Since the kid is a minor, the parents would typically be liable. However, the author's parents might not want to press the issue, possibly to avoid conflict or because they thought it was a minor matter. But the author is the car's owner and is now facing financial loss. \n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong to seek reimbursement. The parents didn't inform them, which is a problem because the owner's consent wasn't obtained to let the matter drop. The parents might have overstepped by deciding the issue without consulting their child. The neighbors, on the other hand, might have thought that because the author wasn't present, it was okay to resolve it themselves. \n\nBut legally, the owner has the right to seek compensation for damages. The fact that the parents were there doesn't absolve the neighbor's family from liability. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to get their money back. Others telling the author they're the asshole might be because they think the matter was resolved, but the author wasn't involved in that resolution. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the person who caused the damage should compensate the owner, and the author has a right to seek reimbursement. The parents' actions don't negate the author's claim to their own property damage costs.\n"
