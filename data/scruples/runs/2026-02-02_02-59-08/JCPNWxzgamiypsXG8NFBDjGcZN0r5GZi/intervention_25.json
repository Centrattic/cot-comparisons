Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's kid hit their parked car while they were abroad. The damage is around $1,000. The parents were told but said not to worry about it. Now the author is upset because they weren't informed and there's no compensation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, if someone damages your property, they are legally responsible for the repairs. But in this case, the parents were the ones who were present and they forgave the debt. So maybe the author is expected to respect their parents' decision? But the author is the car's owner. Maybe the parents didn't have the authority to waive the claim. However, in some jurisdictions, if the car is registered under the author's name, only they can file a claim. \n\nThen there's the social aspect. The parents told them not to worry, and the kid apologized and offered to pay, but the parents declined. Now the author is upset because they had to pay the $1,000. The author is asking for reimbursement, but others are saying they're the asshole for it. The parents might have been trying to be kind to the kids, but the author is the one who has the financial loss. \n\nIs the author overstepping by asking for money now? If the parents already accepted the apology and said it's okay, maybe the author is bringing up an old matter. But the author wasn't part of the original resolution. They might not have been consulted, so is it fair for them to now seek compensation after their parents dismissed the issue?\n\nAlso, the kid is 16. Depending on local laws, the parents might be legally responsible for their child's actions. But if the parents already settled it by saying they don't want any payment, does that legally close the matter? Or does the car owner have the right to pursue compensation regardless of the parents' initial response?\n\nEthically, the kid caused the damage and should take responsibility. The parents might have been too lenient, but the author is the one facing the financial burden. On the other hand, the author wasn't present and the parents were the intermediaries. If the parents said to let it go, is the author overreacting to now want the money?\n\nSo, the author's position is that they deserve the money. Others say they're the asshole for not accepting the resolution. The key points are: legal responsibility, whether the parents could waive the claim, and social expectations. If the parents had the authority to waive the claim, the author might be in the wrong for now demanding payment. If not, then the author has a valid claim. But without knowing the exact laws, it's tricky. But generally, the car owner is the one who can decide to let it go. If the parents didn't consult the owner, maybe the author is not in the wrong. However, if the parents were acting as representatives (maybe because the car was at their house), perhaps they could have made that decision.\n\nI think there's a mix here. The author might not be in the wrong because the parents might not have the authority to waive the claim on their behalf. The kid and parents should be responsible for the damages. But the author is upset because they weren't informed, which is a valid point. So the answer could be B (not in the wrong) because the kid is at fault, and the author is seeking compensation for their loss. However, others might argue that the parents already resolved it, so the author shouldn't be upset. But I think the author has a right to seek reimbursement since the damage was done to their property. So probably B."
