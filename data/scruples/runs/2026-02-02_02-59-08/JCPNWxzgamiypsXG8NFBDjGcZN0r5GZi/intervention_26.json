Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a neighbor's kid hitting their parked car while they were abroad, causing $1,000 in damage. The parents were present and apparently told the kid and his mom not to worry about it. The author is upset because he wasn't informed and didn't get compensation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, when someone causes damage to property, they are responsible for covering the costs. The kid is 16, so his parents might be legally liable as his guardians. However, the parents were there and chose to downplay it, saying not to worry. The author's parents also didn't inform him, which complicates things.\n\nBut the author is now returning and wants reimbursement. He's being told he's the asshole because the parents handled it. The question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the person who caused the damage (the kid) is responsible. But the author's parents might have waived that responsibility by not pressing for payment. However, the author is now being left to pay out of pocket. \n\nEthically, the parents might have overstepped by not informing the car owner. The author has a right to know about the damage and to seek compensation. The kid's parents might be at fault for not taking responsibility. The author's parents might have made a mistake by not involving him. \n\nSo the author is not in the wrong here. He's the victim of the damage and wasn't informed. The people telling him to forget it are the ones who handled the situation poorly. The kid and his parents should be liable, and the author has a right to seek reimbursement. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
