Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in a situation where their neighbor's kid hit their car while they were away, and the parents said not to worry about it. The author is upset because they weren't informed and aren't getting compensation. They want to know if they're the asshole for seeking reimbursement.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, when someone causes damage to another's property, they're typically responsible for covering the costs. The kid is 16, so his parents would be liable as they're the legal guardians. The fact that they were told not to worry about it complicates things. However, the parents were acting on behalf of the car owner at the time, but the actual owner (the author) wasn't there. So, maybe there's a communication breakdown here.\n\nEthically, the author is seeking compensation for damages they didn't cause. The neighbor's family was informed, and they apologized and offered to pay, but the parents dismissed it. The author is now returning and finds out about the damage. The question is whether it's fair for them to ask for reimbursement. The parents might have acted without the author's consent, but the author's parents might have thought they could handle it. However, the author is the legal owner of the car, so they have the right to seek compensation. \n\nThe key points are: 1. Did the neighbor's family know who the car belonged to? If the parents were at their house and the car was at their house, maybe they knew the owner was the author's parents. But the author is the one who owns the car. So if the parents handled it, they might have thought they could settle it. However, the author is the actual owner, so the responsibility for the damage would fall to the neighbor's family. \n\nThe author isn't in the wrong for seeking reimbursement because it's their property. The neighbor's family should be responsible for the damages. However, the author's parents might have intended to resolve it without involving the author, but that's not their right. The author has every right to be upset about not being informed and not getting compensation. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They're justified in seeking reimbursement for damages caused to their property.\n"
