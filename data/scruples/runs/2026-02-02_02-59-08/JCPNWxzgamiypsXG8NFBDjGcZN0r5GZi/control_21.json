Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's kid hit their car while they were abroad. The parents were there and dealt with the kid and his parents, but when the author comes back, they're upset about the damage and want reimbursement. The parents and others think the author is overreacting.\n\nFirst, the kid is 16 years old. At that age, they might not be financially responsible, so maybe the parents should have handled it. The kid did apologize and offer to pay, but the parents said not to worry. But the parents here are the ones who were present. The author's parents told them not to worry, but the author isn't the one who hit the car. The author is the one who owns the car and is now out $1,000. The question is whether the author is wrong to ask for reimbursement.\n\nIn terms of legal responsibility, when someone's kid causes damage, the parents can be held responsible if the kid is a minor. So maybe the author is justified in seeking reimbursement from the kid's parents. The fact that the author's parents allowed it to go without addressing might be an issue, but they weren't the ones at fault. The author didn't cause the damage, so they shouldn't be the one paying for it. The neighbors didn't inform the author either, which adds to the problem.\n\nThe other side is that the author's parents were present and resolved it, so maybe the author isn't in the right to bring it up now. But the parents might have made a mistake by not ensuring compensation. Legally, the author has a right to seek reimbursement because the damage was done to their property. However, social norms might make others think the author is being too harsh, but that doesn't mean they're wrong.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because they're seeking reimbursement for damages caused to their property, which is their right.\n"
