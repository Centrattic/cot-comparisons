Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that a 16-year-old neighbor hit their parked car, causing $1000 damage. The parents were there and the kid apologized, but they weren't told to call the police or file a claim. The author came back to find the damage and wants reimbursement, but everyone says they're the asshole for asking.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. If the car was parked on private property, maybe the neighbor's responsibility is different. But generally, if someone causes damage, they should be responsible. However, the parents might have resolved it without the owner's knowledge. Legally, the parents might have accepted the apology and waved the claim, but ethically, the author has a right to be informed and compensated.\n\nThen there's the age factor. The kid is 16, so the parents would be responsible for any claims. But if the parents said it's okay, maybe they're liable. But the author wasn't consulted. So the parents might have acted without the owner's consent. That's a problem because the car owner has the right to decide what happens with their property. \n\nAlso, the author is in a different country and couldn't make decisions. So the parents shouldn't have dismissed the claim without talking to the owner. The kid and parents should have informed the owner and arranged for repairs or payment. Since they didn't, the author is justified in seeking reimbursement. \n\nOn the flip side, maybe the parents were trying to be kind and resolve it quickly. But not informing the owner is a breach of trust. The author's main points are not being informed and not getting compensation. Legally, if the parents accepted the apology and waved the claim, the author might be out of luck. But ethically, they should have checked with the owner first. \n\nSo the answer might be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because they have a right to compensation and information about their car. The parents and the kid should have handled it properly.\n"
