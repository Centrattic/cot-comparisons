Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit the author's parked car when the author was in Germany. The kid and his parents went to the author's parents' house, apologized, and offered to pay, but the parents reportedly said not to worry about it. Now the author is upset because he wasn't informed and there's no compensation. People are saying he's the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. In many places, if someone's property is damaged, the responsible party is usually liable for repairs. But since the author's parents were there, maybe they handled it. Did the parents have the legal right to forgive the debt? In some jurisdictions, the car's owner is the one who can claim damages. Since the author was the owner, maybe the parents shouldn't have settled it without his consent. \n\nAlso, the kid is a minor. His parents are legally responsible for his actions. So even if the parents said not to worry about it, the author might still have the right to pursue compensation. But the parents might have a good relationship and didn't want to create a problem. However, the author is out $1,000, which is a lot. Was it wrong for him to ask for reimbursement after finding out?\n\nThe author's parents might have thought it was a small matter and didn't realize the cost. But $1,000 isn't trivial. The kid's parents were upset about calling the police, maybe they feared insurance rates or other consequences. But the author's main issue is being out of pocket.\n\nSo, from a rights perspective, the author is justified in seeking reimbursement since he's the car owner. The parents might have been too lenient without considering the financial impact. The neighbors, while they might have been trying to resolve it amicably, should have informed the author. The author isn't in the wrong for seeking what's his. The answer is probably B (No).\n"
