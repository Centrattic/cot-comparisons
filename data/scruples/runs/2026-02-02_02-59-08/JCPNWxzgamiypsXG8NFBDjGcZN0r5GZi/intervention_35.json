Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit the AITA's parked car while they were abroad. The parents were notified but didn't inform the AITA. When the AITA returns, they find out about the damage and want reimbursement. The parents and others think the AITA is overreacting.\n\nFirst, the kid was at fault for causing the damage. At 16, they might not be able to pay, so the parents would be responsible. The parents did talk to the neighbor's parents, and they were upset about reporting it. The AITA's parents told them not to worry about it, which is why the AITA wasn't informed. Now the AITA is upset because they had to pay for the repairs and feels wronged.\n\nThe question is about whether the AITA is in the wrong. The user initially thinks the AITA is in the wrong but wants confirmation. But wait, the AITA is the one who didn't know about the damage until returning. They're not the one who caused the accident. The neighbor's family didn't inform the AITA, which is a problem. The AITA is now asking for reimbursement, which is their right. The parents dismissing it might be inconsiderate because the AITA had to bear the financial burden.\n\nSo, from a legal standpoint, the person who caused the damage (the kid) is responsible. The parents might have handled it by not informing the AITA, but that doesn't absolve the kid or their parents of liability. The AITA is within their rights to seek compensation. The parents and others telling them to let it go might be morally lenient, but the AITA isn't wrong for trying to recover their costs. Therefore, the answer would be B, the AITA is not in the wrong.\n"
