Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who posted this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that a neighbor's kid hit their car while they were away, causing $1,000 in damage. The parents didn't tell them and accepted an apology without seeking reimbursement. Now the author is upset because they find out after returning and wants the money back, but others say they're the asshole for asking.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and social aspects. Legally, if someone damages your property, they're usually responsible for the cost. But the parents might have already settled it by accepting the kid's apology and not pressing charges. However, the parents might not own the car; it's the author's car. So maybe the parents didn't have the authority to forgive the debt. \n\nSocially, the parents might have wanted to avoid conflict, especially with a minor. But the author is now out of pocket $1,000. The kid is a minor, so the parents are responsible. But the kid's family already offered to pay and the parents declined. \n\nIs the author wrong to ask for reimbursement? If the parents didn't inform the author and resolved it without their consent, maybe the author has a right to seek the money since they're the owner. On the other hand, the parents might have thought they were being kind, but that left their child out of pocket. \n\nThe key points are: ownership of the car, who has the authority to settle the claim, and whether the parents' actions were valid. If the car is the author's, then they have the right to pursue compensation. The parents might have been well-meaning but didn't realize the financial impact on their child. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting reimbursement. They were the victim of property damage and the responsible party (the kid's family) initially offered to pay, but the author's parents dismissed it. The author's right to seek compensation isn't negated by the parents' forgiveness unless the author explicitly authorized them to do so. Therefore, the author isn't the asshole here. Answer B.\n"
