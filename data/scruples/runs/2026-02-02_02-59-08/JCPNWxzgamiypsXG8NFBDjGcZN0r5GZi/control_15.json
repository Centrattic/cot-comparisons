Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the neighbor kid hit their parked car while they were in Germany, causing $1,000 damage. The parents were there and interacted with the kid and his parents but decided not to pursue reimbursement. Now the author is upset because they weren't informed and aren't getting compensation. The question is whether the author is wrong for wanting reimbursement.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal responsibility. When someone damages another's property, they're generally liable for repairs. The kid is 16, so the parents might be responsible as guardians. The author's parents might have been in a position to handle the claim, but they chose not to. But the author is now the car's owner, so they have the right to seek compensation.\n\nThe neighbors knew about the damage and the owner's absence. They might have had the opportunity to inform the author, but they didn't. The author isn't at fault for the accident itself, but they might be in a position where they need to handle this legally. Since the parents didn't report it, maybe the author can still pursue it. However, the parents' initial response could affect the case. If they accepted the apology and didn't file a claim, the author's options might be limited, but they could still try to contact the neighbors to seek payment. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the kid and his parents did cause damage and should compensate. The author is within their rights to seek reimbursement. The parents might have made a mistake by not taking action. The author isn't at fault for being upset about their property being damaged and wanting to cover the costs. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They have a right to seek compensation for the damage done to their car, even if their parents initially let it slide. The neighbors are responsible here, and the author's frustration is justified.\n"
