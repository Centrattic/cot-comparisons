Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that a 16-year-old neighbor kid hit their parked car while they were in Germany for three months. The kid and his mom went to the author's parents to address it, but the parents told them not to worry. The author is upset because they weren't informed and there's no compensation, but others are saying they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and social aspects. Legally, if someone damages a car, they're usually responsible for repairs. But the author's parents might have resolved it themselves. The kid offered to pay, but the parents accepted the apology and didn't ask for money. So maybe the author's parents already handled it by forgiving the debt. However, the author is now upset because they didn't know and had to pay the $1,000 themselves. \n\nSocially, the parents might have thought it was a minor incident and didn't want to burden the kid. The kid is 16, which is a minor, so maybe the parents of the kid were involved. The author's parents might have acted as the legal representatives since they were the ones present. But the author is the owner of the car, so they should have been informed, right? \n\nWait, the author wasn't there, so their parents had the authority to make decisions on their behalf. If the parents chose not to pursue reimbursement, that's their prerogative. The author might feel wronged because they ended up paying, but legally, the parents could have decided not to go through with a claim. \n\nAlso, when the kid offered to pay, the parents declined. So maybe the author's parents already accepted the apology and the kid's offer, and thus, there's no further obligation. The author is upset about not being informed, but if the parents didn't tell them, maybe the author should have trusted their judgment. \n\nBut the author's parents might not have considered the financial impact on the author, who's trying to afford a visa. That's a valid point. The parents might have acted without the author's knowledge, which could be a mistake. However, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for asking for reimbursement now. \n\nSince the parents already resolved the matter by not pressing the issue, the author might not have a legal claim. But socially, the author might feel wronged because they weren't consulted. The key here is whether the parents had the right to make that decision for the author. If the parents are the legal guardians of the author's car (since it's parked at their house), maybe they did. \n\nSo, legally, if the parents accepted the kid's apology and declined compensation, the author can't suddenly ask for it later. Socially, maybe the parents should have informed the author, but the author's action now might be seen as going back on an agreement made by their parents. Hence, the author could be in the wrong. \n\nBut wait, the author's parents didn't own the car, so maybe their authority is different. If the car belongs to the author, the parents might not have the right to forgive the debt without the owner's consent. That's a possible angle. So in that case, the parents' decision might not be valid, and the author could be right to seek reimbursement. \n\nHmm, but the parents were acting on their own, not as the car's owners. The car was parked at their house, but the author is the owner. If the parents didn't inform the author about the damage and the kid's offer, that's a problem. The author might not be in the wrong for not knowing. \n\nSo, the kid hit the car and offered to pay, but the parents didn't inform the author. The author is now asking for reimbursement, but since the parents already interacted with the kid and possibly accepted his offer, the author might be overstepping. However, if the parents didn't actually accept the offer and just said to not worry about it, maybe the author can still pursue it. \n\nBut the story says the kid \"offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\" So the parents might have accepted the apology and declined the offer. If that's the case, the author can't now go back and ask for money because the parents already resolved it. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong for not respecting their parents' decision and now trying to get compensation after the fact. The correct answer would be A.\n"
