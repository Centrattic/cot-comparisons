Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that a neighbor's kid hit their car while they were away, and the parents didn't inform them or arrange compensation. The author is upset because they had to pay $1k and others say they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, legal responsibility. In most places, if someone causes damage, they're liable. The kid is 16, so his parents would be responsible. The parents approached the author's parents and seemed to agree to not report it, but the author didn't know. The parents might have been trying to avoid conflict, but that doesn't make the damage right. \n\nEthically, the parents should have informed the car owner. The author has a right to know about the damage to their property. The kid did apologize and offer to pay, but the parents might have dismissed it. The author is now being told to accept it, but they're out of pocket. \n\nThe key points are that the parents didn't inform the owner, and they didn't ensure compensation. The author isn't wrong for seeking reimbursement. The parents might have acted in good faith to avoid confrontation, but that doesn't negate the author's right to be compensated. \n\nSo the author isn't in the wrong. They're standing up for their rights. Answer B.\n"
