Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the neighbor kid hit the author's parked car while the author was away. The parents were present and talked to the kid and his mom but didn't inform the author upon his return. The author is upset he has to pay $1k and wants reimbursement, but everyone else thinks he's overreacting.\n\nFirst, the kid hit the car. The kid is 16, so a minor. His parents were involved. The parents and the kid offered to pay but the author's parents told them not to worry. Did the parents have the right to make that decision? The car belongs to the author, so he's the owner. The parents might not have the authority to forgive the debt. The kid caused the damage, so the parents or the kid might be liable. But since the parents were there, they might have accepted responsibility by offering to pay. However, the author's parents said not to worry, which could be a release of liability.\n\nThe author's issue is that he wasn't informed until he came back. The parents might have thought they handled it, but the author feels he wasn't consulted. Legally, the parents might not have the right to waive the claim. The kid's parents offered to pay initially, but the author's parents refused. Now the author is left with the bill.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author is not the one who caused the damage. The kid is at fault. The author's parents might have acted without his knowledge, but he is the victim. The fact that the kid and parents initially offered to pay suggests they acknowledged responsibility. The author's parents might have dismissed the situation hastily. The author is not in the wrong for seeking reimbursement since it's his car and his money. The people telling him he's the asshole might not realize that the parents handled the situation without his input. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
