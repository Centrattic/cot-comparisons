Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's kid hit their parked car while they were abroad. The kid and his parents went to the author's parents to resolve it, but the parents said not to worry about it. Now the author is upset because they didn't get reimbursed and is being told by others to not make a big deal out of it.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are: the parents handled the situation by forgiving the debt, the kid apologized and offered to pay but was told not to worry. The author is now upset because they weren't informed and didn't get compensation. \n\nLegally, if the parents accepted the apology and said not to worry about the payment, that might be considered a resolution. So maybe the author is now trying to take back the forgiveness of the debt, which could complicate things. But emotionally, the author feels wronged because they didn't know and lost $1000. \n\nBut the question is about being in the wrong, not just legally. The author's parents might have the authority to forgive the debt, so if they did, then the author might not have a case. However, the author is the car owner and maybe the parents didn't have the right to forgive the debt on their behalf. That's a possible angle. If the parents didn't have the authority, then the kid still owes the money. But if they did, then the author is in the wrong for expecting payment now.\n\nAlso, the kid was 16, so a minor. Legally, the parents might be responsible for any damages. But since the parents already said not to worry about it, maybe the author's parents accepted that. \n\nThe Reddit community might see the author as overstepping because the parents already resolved it. However, the author is the one who owns the car and is now being asked to eat the cost. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the parents had the authority to forgive the debt. If they did, then the author is in the wrong for expecting reimbursement. If they didn't, then the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nBut typically, parents can't forgive debts on behalf of their adult children without their consent. So maybe the author's parents didn't have the right to say not to worry about it. In that case, the author is justified in seeking reimbursement. But since they already told the kid's parents to forget it, the author might be seen as going back on that. So it's a bit complicated.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but maybe that's not the case. The answer could be B (not in the wrong) because the parents might not have the authority to forgive the debt, so the author is justified in seeking reimbursement. However, others might argue that the author's parents already handled it, so they shouldn't be upset now. \n\nI'm leaning towards B because the parents might not have the legal right to forgive the debt, so the author isn't in the wrong for seeking reimbursement. But there's also the social aspect where the parents said to forget it, so the author is seen as the asshole for going back. But legally, maybe the author is right. So the answer might be B.\n"
