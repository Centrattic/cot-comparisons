Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is wrong for seeking reimbursement after their neighbor's kid damaged their car.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author left their car parked at their parents' house while they were abroad. The neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit the car. The kid and his mom went to the parents, and the parents said not to worry about it. The kid apologized and offered to pay, but the parents dismissed it. Now the author is upset because they didn't get informed and aren't getting compensation. Everyone around them thinks they're overreacting, but the author believes the kid should cover the $1,000 damage.\n\nSo, what's the legal or moral angle here? Legally, if someone causes damage, they're usually responsible for repairs. But since the author's parents were present, they might have been the ones to handle the situation. The parents told the kid's family not to worry about it, so maybe they considered it resolved. However, the author didn't know about the damage and is now out of pocket.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for asking for reimbursement? Well, the parents might have thought they covered it by telling the kid's family. But the author wasn't involved in that conversation and didn't have a chance to make a decision. The kid is a minor, so his parents would be responsible. The parents might have agreed to let it go, but maybe the author has the right to seek compensation since the car is theirs. However, the parents might have legal authority to make such decisions, especially if the car is registered under them.\n\nMoral perspective: The kid is at fault for causing damage, but since the parents already handled it by saying not to worry, maybe the author is overstepping by now demanding money. But the author wasn't part of that agreement. If the parents had the authority to waive the claim, then the author can't go back and ask for it now. But if the parents didn't own the car, the author could argue their own rights. However, the car was at the parents' house, so maybe they are considered the legal representatives.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? If the parents had the legal right to settle the matter, then the author is wrong to later demand compensation. But if the parents didn't have the right to do that, maybe the author isn't. But typically, parents of a minor can handle such matters for their child. Also, the kid's parents were upset about filing a claim, so maybe they thought the parents' dismissal was acceptable. The author's parents might have been trying to be lenient, but the author feels wronged because they had to pay.\n\nHmm. The key points are: 1. The parents handled the situation and said not to worry. 2. The author wasn't informed. 3. The kid's family might have agreed to let it go. If the parents had the authority to settle the claim, then the author is wrong to now ask again. But if the parents didn't own the car, then maybe the author has a right. But since the car was parked at the parents' house, maybe they were acting on the author's behalf. However, the author wasn't consulted. Was the car the author's? If so, the parents might not have the legal right to waive the claim without the owner's consent. So maybe the parents made a mistake in dismissing the matter without the author's input. Thus, the author isn't wrong for seeking reimbursement because the original owners (the author) should have been involved in the decision. But if the parents had the authority, then the author is wrong. It's a bit of a legal gray area, but in many places, the car owner is responsible, so the parents might not have the right to settle the claim. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
