Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit the person's parked car while they were away. The parents were present and interacted with the neighbors, but when the owner returns, he's upset about not being informed and not getting compensation.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, the kid was a minor, so the parents would be responsible. If they didn't report the incident to the car owner, maybe they didn't inform them because they tried to settle it themselves. But ethically, when someone's property is damaged, they have the right to know and seek compensation. The parents might have thought they were handling it by having the kid apologize and offer to pay, but the owner wasn't contacted. So, the owner might not be in the wrong for seeking reimbursement, especially since he wasn't part of the initial resolution. However, maybe the parents thought they were resolving it by saying not to worry. The key issue is whether the owner was informed. The author's parents didn't tell him, so he was caught off guard. The neighbors might have been advised to pay, but they might not have done so. The author's reaction is about being informed and getting compensation. In terms of responsibility, the parents might have acted without informing the owner, but the author isn't wrong for wanting reimbursement. So, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because he's entitled to compensation for damages caused to his property. The neighbors and parents might be at fault for not informing him, but the author isn't the asshole for seeking what's owed to him.\n"
