Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit their car while they were abroad. The parents were present when the incident happened, the kid apologized and offered to pay, but the parents were told not to worry about it. Now the author is upset because they didn't get reimbursed and they find out after returning.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, if someone damages your property, you can claim compensation. However, the parents might have forgiven the debt, especially if the kid is a minor. But the author wasn't even informed, which could be an issue.\n\nThen there's the social aspect. The parents might have tried to handle it amicably, not wanting to involve the police or insurance, which could affect their relationship with the neighbors. But the author is now out $1,000 and might feel wronged because no one communicated with them. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they didn't do anything to cause the damage. They left their car parked legally. The kid was at fault, but the parents might have resolved it without informing the car owner. The author is now seeking reimbursement after the fact. But was it their responsibility to track down the kid and make a claim? Or did the initial resolution by the parents absolve the kid's responsibility?\n\nAlso, cultural context in Germany might play a role. How do they typically handle such incidents? If the parents said not to worry about it, does that legally release the kid from liability? If the author wasn't present, maybe they should have checked with their parents beforehand about any incidents. \n\nBut the key points here are that the kid caused damage, the parents were involved, and the owner wasn't informed. The author is now seeking what they believe they're owed. Depending on local laws, the author might have a right to claim. However, since the parents might have already resolved it, the author's anger could be justified if they weren't part of that resolution. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the parents had authority to forgive the debt, then the author might not have a case. But if they weren't consulted, maybe they're justified in seeking compensation. It's a bit of a gray area. But the answer likely depends on the legal framework. In some places, the parent's forgiveness could be legally valid, making the author at fault for not accepting it. In others, the original owner might still have a claim. \n\nHowever, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong morally or socially. The author is upset because they weren't informed. The neighbors might have handled it without involving them, which could be seen as considerate, but it's also possible the author should have known. If the parents didn't inform them, maybe they're responsible for not checking in. \n\nIn the end, the answer might hinge on whether the author's parents had the authority to forgive the debt without their input. If the author is the owner of the car, the parents might not have the right to waive their rights to compensation. So the author isn't in the wrong. Alternatively, if the parents were acting as their agents, then maybe they did. But that's unclear. Given the info, the author's position seems reasonable, so the answer is B.\n"
