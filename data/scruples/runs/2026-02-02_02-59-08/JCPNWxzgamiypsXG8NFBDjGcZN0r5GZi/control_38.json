Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post (AITA) is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit their parked car while they were away. The parents were there and spoke to the kid's family, who offered to pay but the parents said not to worry. Now the author is upset because they had to pay for the repairs and everyone's telling them they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. If a minor causes damage, the parents are generally responsible. So the kid's parents should be liable. The fact that they offered to pay but were told not to worry might not absolve them legally. But the parents of the car owner (the author's parents) might have given up their right by accepting an apology and saying it's okay. However, the author wasn't consulted, so maybe they have a right to seek compensation even after their parents handled it.\n\nThen there's the moral side. The author is being blamed for \"overreacting,\" but they're out $1k. It's their property, so they have the right to be upset. The kid didn't inform them, which is a problem. The neighbors might have resolved it informally, but that doesn't necessarily mean the author can't pursue it now.\n\nAlso, the parents might have made a decision they shouldn't have, especially without the author's input. They were the legal owners of the car, so their parents had standing to speak on their behalf while they were away. But if the author is now the registered owner, they might still have the right to seek reimbursement even if their parents initially said it's okay.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They're being blamed for seeking what's rightfully theirs. The neighbors, especially the kid's family, should be responsible. The answer is B.\n"
