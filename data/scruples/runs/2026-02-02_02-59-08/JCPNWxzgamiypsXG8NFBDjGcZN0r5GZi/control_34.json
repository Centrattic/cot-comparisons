Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that a neighbor's kid hit their parked car while they were abroad. The parents were there and interacted with the kid and his family, who offered to pay but were told not to worry about it. Now the car owner is upset because he wasn't informed and isn't getting compensation.\n\nFirst, the question is about liability. When someone's property is damaged, the person responsible is usually liable for damages. The kid was 16, so his parents might be liable as well. The parents of the car owner (the poster's parents) initially said not to worry, which might have been a mistake because they weren't the ones who owned the car. The poster, as the car owner, has a right to seek reimbursement since he's the one who has to pay for repairs. \n\nThe neighbors might have thought the matter was resolved because the poster's parents said to forget it, but legally, the parents aren't the ones responsible for the car's damages. The poster's issue is that he wasn't informed and now has to pay. So is he in the wrong? Well, he's not the one who hit the car. The neighbors didn't inform him, which is part of the problem. The fact that his parents dismissed the issue might have led the neighbors to think it's okay not to pay. But the responsibility lies with the person who caused the damage. The poster isn't wrong for seeking compensation. So the answer is B, he isn't in the wrong.\n"
