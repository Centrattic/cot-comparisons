Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the Reddit scenario is the asshole (AITA) or not. The situation is that a 16-year-old neighbor hit their parked car, causing $1k damage. The parents of the kid went to the author's parents, who said not to worry. The author came back, found the damage, and is upset about not being reimbursed. The question is if the author is in the wrong by asking for reimbursement.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, if a minor causes damage, their parents are usually responsible. So the kid's parents might be liable. The author's parents might have resolved it without telling the author, but the author is now the rightful owner of the car, so they should be informed about such a significant expense.\n\nEthically, the neighbor's family might have thought the matter was settled by apologizing and promising to pay, but the author wasn't consulted. The author's parents might have overstepped by dismissing the issue, but the author has the right to seek compensation for their property.\n\nThe key points are: the damage was done, the responsible party (kid's parents) didn't inform the car owner, and the author is now being blamed for being upset. The author isn't in the wrong for seeking reimbursement because they're the ones who have to pay for the repairs. The neighbor's family should have informed the actual owner and handled the compensation properly. The author's parents might have made a mistake by not involving the author, but that doesn't absolve the other party from responsibility.\n\nSo the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
