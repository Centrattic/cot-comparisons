Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this situation. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The scenario is that their neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit their parked car while they were away in Germany. The kid's parents were involved, and they apparently told the author's parents not to worry about it. The author is upset because they weren't informed and aren't getting compensation, and others are saying they're the asshole. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but is curious for an opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the facts. The car was parked at the author's parents' house. The kid hit it, and the kid's parents came to the parents' house to resolve it. The kid apologized and offered to pay, but the parents were told not to worry. The author wasn't told anything and is now upset about having to pay for repairs. The parents and others are advising him to just let it go.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the kid caused damage, the parents of the kid were involved, and the author's parents dismissed the matter. The author is now seeking reimbursement, but others are suggesting he's being unreasonable.\n\nFrom a legal perspective, the person who caused the damage is typically responsible for the cost. However, the parents of the kid might be liable as the child is a minor. But in this case, the author's parents already interacted with the other parents and accepted their assurance that it was okay. The author wasn't present, so maybe there's an issue of authority here. Did the author's parents have the right to waive the claim on behalf of the author? If the author is the car's owner, then the parents might not have the legal right to settle the matter without the owner's consent, especially if the car is in the author's name.\n\nBut from a social standpoint, the author's parents might have thought it was a minor incident and wanted to avoid conflict. However, the author is now facing financial loss because of this. The kid did apologize and offered to pay, but the parents were told not to pursue it. The author is now upset that he has to bear the cost. \n\nIn terms of responsibility: the kid is at fault for causing the damage. The parents of the kid might be partially at fault for not making sure the matter was resolved properly. The author's parents might have overstepped if they dismissed the claim without the owner's consent. The author is now seeking what they believe is a legitimate claim. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's parents may have made a decision that affected the author's property. The author is now asking for reimbursement, which the other parties are reluctant to provide. If the author is overreacting because others told him to just let it go, but he's being asked to absorb a $1000 cost, is that fair? \n\nIn community standards, sometimes people choose to let minor incidents go, but when it comes to significant costs, it's reasonable to expect the responsible party to cover it. The fact that the kid offered to pay but was told not to worry might mean that the parents of the kid aren't following through. The author's parents might have been reasonable in trying to avoid conflict, but they didn't consider the owner's (author's) position. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The author is the car's owner, so he has the right to expect that the damage is addressed. If the parents dismissed the claim without his consent, that could be an issue. However, if the parents had the authority to act on his behalf, maybe not. But in most cases, parents wouldn't have the legal authority to settle someone else's claim. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong for seeking reimbursement. The kid's parents are responsible for their child's actions, and the author's parents shouldn't have prevented the author from seeking compensation. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
