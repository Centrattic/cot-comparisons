Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's kid hit their parked car while they were away, causing $1k in damage. The parents were there and interacted with the kid and his mom. They didn't tell the author and said not to worry. Now the author is upset they didn't get reimbursed and everyone says they're being an asshole.\n\nHmm. So the author is in Germany, parents handled the situation, kid offered to pay but parents said it's okay. Now the author is upset because they didn't get compensation. The question is whether the author is wrong to be upset.\n\nFirst, legally, if someone's property is damaged, they have the right to seek compensation. But in this case, the parents were the ones present. So maybe the author isn't at fault for asking for reimbursement. The parents might have forgiven the debt, but the author is the owner of the car. So the parents shouldn't have decided that without consulting the owner.\n\nBut then, the kid is a minor. The parents might have handled it as per their discretion. However, the author is the one who has to pay. The neighbors might be responsible, but if the kid's parents said they'd handle it, maybe they didn't follow through. The author's parents might have thought they were being kind, but it's not their car. They shouldn't have made that decision.\n\nSo the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to be reimbursed. The neighbors are responsible. The parents overstepped by not informing the owner. So answer B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
