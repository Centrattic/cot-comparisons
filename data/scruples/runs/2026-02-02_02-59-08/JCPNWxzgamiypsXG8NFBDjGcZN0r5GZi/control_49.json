Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves a neighbor's kid hitting their parked car while they were away. The author's parents were there and spoke to the kid and his parents, who offered to pay but were told not to worry. Now the author is upset about not being informed and not getting compensation.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the key points. The kid is 16, so a minor. The parents were involved. The car was parked at the author's parents' house, so they were present. The kid's family offered to pay, but the author's parents dismissed it. The author comes back to find the damage and is upset about not being informed and not getting reimbursed. The parents and others think the author is overreacting.\n\nLegally, if a minor causes damage, the parents are usually responsible. The kid's parents offered to pay, but the author's parents let it slide. However, the author is the car owner and might have the right to decide what happens. But since they were away, maybe their parents had authority. But ethically, the author's parents might have made a decision without considering the car owner's wishes, which in this case is the author. The author didn't know about the incident until returning, which is a problem because they didn't have a chance to decide how to handle it.\n\nSo is the author in the wrong? If the parents had the authority to make the decision, maybe not. But if they didn't inform the author, who is the car owner, then maybe the parents are at fault. The author is upset because they weren't told and didn't get compensation. The kid's family was willing to pay but were told not to worry. The author is now facing financial loss without prior knowledge. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the owner of the car is the one who has the right to seek compensation. If the parents, acting on behalf of the author, dismissed the claim, maybe that's where the problem lies. But if the author was away and the parents were managing their affairs, perhaps that's acceptable. However, not informing the author about the damage is a significant issue. The parents might have made a decision without the owner's consent, which could be problematic.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the kid's family should have informed the author once they realized the damage. Since the author's parents were there, they had a duty to inform the car owner. Failing to do so means the author was left out of the loop. The author is now facing the financial burden and is upset about not being involved in the decision to forgive the debt.\n\nSo in terms of right or wrong, the author is within their rights to be upset. The parents might have overstepped by not informing them. The kid's family did offer to pay, but the author's parents didn't involve the actual owner. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting compensation. The people saying the author is the asshole are probably not considering the legal rights of the car owner and the lack of communication from the parents. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
