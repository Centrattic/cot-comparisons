Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that their neighbor's 16-year-old kid backed into their parked car while they were abroad. The kid and his mom went to the parents' house, apologized, and offered to pay, but the parents said not to worry. Now the author is upset because he didn't know and isn't getting reimbursed. Friends and family think he's overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical angles here. Legally, in many places, if someone damages your property, they are responsible for the damage. The kid is a minor, so his parents might be liable. But the parents were present and offered to pay but were told not to worry. However, the parents didn't actually pay, so maybe the author should have followed up to ensure compensation.\n\nEthically, the parents might have thought it was a good deed to let it go, but the author is now out $1000. The neighbors might have a different view on responsibility. The author's parents might have been trying to be kind, but maybe they should have communicated with the author first instead of just dismissing it.\n\nAlso, the author didn't know about the damage until returning. So, maybe the parents should have informed him. If they had, he could have handled it himself. The fact that they didn't tell him might be an issue.\n\nBut the kid did apologize and offer to pay, so maybe the parents were trying to resolve it but the author's parents stopped them. The author is now left with the cost. Was he wrong to ask for reimbursement? If the parents already told them not to worry, maybe the author shouldn't be upset because the issue was resolved. But maybe the author's parents didn't have the authority to forgive the debt, especially since the car is the author's.\n\nWait, the author owns the car, right? So even if the parents are the ones present, they might not have the right to waive the claim. The author is the one who owns the property. So maybe the parents overstepped by telling the neighbors not to worry. The author is justified in seeking compensation because it's their property. The parents might have been trying to help but didn't realize the legal implications.\n\nIn that case, the author isn't in the wrong for seeking reimbursement. The neighbors did the damage, offered to pay, but were told not to. So the author has a right to pursue it. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But I need to check if there's any nuance I'm missing. Like, maybe the parents were trying to be generous, but the author being upset is valid because he's the one who has to pay. So the author isn't the asshole here.\n"
