Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that a neighbor kid hit their car while they were away. The parents were present and the kid offered to pay, but the parents told them not to worry about it. Now the author is upset because they had to pay for the damages and feels like everyone's telling them to just forget it.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out who's at fault. The kid caused the damage, so he's responsible. The parents might be liable since he's a minor. The author's parents were there and let it slide, but the car owner (the author) wasn't informed. The author is now being blamed for being an asshole for asking for reimbursement. \n\nThe key points: The kid's responsibility, the parents' role in resolving it, whether the author was properly informed. The author's parents might have tried to resolve it themselves, but the author wasn't part of that. The author is now facing financial loss. \n\nLegally, the person who caused damage is responsible. Since the kid was a minor, his parents would be responsible. The author's parents might have tried to handle it informally. But the author didn't know, so maybe they have a right to ask for reimbursement. \n\nBut the author's parents might have already dealt with the other parents, and the author is now making a demand after the fact. If the author's parents told the other parents not to worry about it, maybe they intended to cover it. The author is upset because they have to pay, but maybe the parents thought they could handle it. \n\nSo the author isn't in the wrong because they weren't part of the initial resolution. The kid and his parents should compensate them. The author's parents might have made a mistake by not informing them. So the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
