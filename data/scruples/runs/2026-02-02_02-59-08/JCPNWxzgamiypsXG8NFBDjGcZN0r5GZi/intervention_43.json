Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that a neighbor's kid, 16 years old, hit the author's parked car while the author was abroad. The kid and his mom went to the author's parents' house, apologized, and offered to pay, but the parents told them not to worry about it. Now the author is upset because he had to come back and find out about the damage without any prior notice and no compensation. The author is asking if he's the asshole for wanting reimbursement.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, if someone damages another person's property, they are usually responsible for covering the costs. Even though the parents tried to resolve it informally, the fact that the kid caused the damage might mean the author is entitled to compensation. But maybe the parents already handled it, and the author didn't ask them about the incident before returning. The parents might have decided to let it go, so when the author comes back and demands money, it's causing tension.\n\nThen there's the social aspect. The author's parents and neighbors might feel that the author is overreacting now, especially since they tried to resolve it without involving him. The author wasn't present when the accident happened, and the parents might have thought it was better to avoid conflict, especially with a minor. But the author is now facing financial loss, which is valid. However, he didn't check in with his parents about the car's condition before coming back. Maybe he should have asked if anything happened during his stay.\n\nThe kid is a minor, so the responsibility would typically fall on the parents. If the kid's family offered to pay but the author's parents refused, then the author is now out of pocket. But maybe the parents should have informed the author about the incident when he returned. Not telling him and then not reimbursing him might be their fault, not the author's. The author's anger is about not being informed and not getting compensation, which seems reasonable. However, he allowed the car to be parked in a place where it could be hit without his knowledge, and maybe he should have arranged for someone to check on it. \n\nOn Reddit, people often consider intentions and context. The author didn't know about the accident and is now facing unexpected costs. The parents and neighbors might not think he's in the wrong because they tried to handle it, but he's angry about being in the dark. The kid's family might have the means to pay, and the author is justified in seeking reimbursement. But since his parents didn't inform him and dismissed the issue, maybe he's overstepping by bringing it up now. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nI think the key points are whether the author's parents should have informed him about the incident and whether the author's demand for reimbursement is reasonable after the parents already tried to resolve it. If the parents didn't inform him, maybe they are at fault. But the author is also responsible for his own property. If he had known, he could have handled it himself. Since he didn't check in and the parents let it go, he might be in a tricky spot. But I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because the damage wasn't his fault and the others should have covered it. But maybe others see it as his parents already dealt with it, so he shouldn't be upset now. Hmm.\n"
