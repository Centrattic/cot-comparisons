Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that a neighbor's kid, 16 years old, hit their parked car while they were abroad. The parents were there and interacted with the kid and his mom. The kid apologized and offered to pay, but the parents said not to worry. Now the author comes back to find out about the damage and is upset because he wasn't informed and there's no compensation. People are saying he's the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the legal and moral aspects. Legally, the kid is a minor, so the parents would typically be responsible. If the parents said not to worry, maybe they took it upon themselves to handle it, but the author is the car owner. The parents might have given a false assurance that they would take care of it, but didn't follow through. \n\nMorally, the car owner is entitled to reimbursement if someone else's actions caused damage. The kid did hit the car and offered to pay, but the parents might have dismissed it. The author isn't at fault here. The problem is that the parents who were present didn't inform the actual owner (the author) and also didn't make sure the reimbursement happened. \n\nSo, the author is not at fault. He's returning to discover damage that was caused during his absence. The neighbors and parents should have informed him and covered the cost. The fact that they said not to worry but didn't actually compensate him is the issue. The author is justified in seeking reimbursement because it's his property and the others were negligent in handling the situation. \n\nThe answer should be B, because the author isn't in the wrong. The neighbors and their parents are responsible here. The author is just seeking what's owed to him.\n"
