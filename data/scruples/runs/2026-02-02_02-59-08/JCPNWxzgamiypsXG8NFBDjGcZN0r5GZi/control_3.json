Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user's car was damaged by a neighbor's 16-year-old kid while they were away in Germany. The kid hit the car, and his parents went to the user's parents to address it. The parents were told not to worry about it, the kid apologized, and maybe offered to pay, but the user's parents let it go. Now the user is upset because they weren't informed and there's no compensation. They're asking if they're the asshole for wanting reimbursement.\n\nFirst, the kid was at fault for causing the damage. Since he's a minor, his parents are typically responsible. The user's parents might have resolved it by accepting an apology and letting it go, but the user, as the actual car owner, has a right to know about the damage and to seek compensation. The user's parents might not have considered the financial impact on the user, who wasn't there. The user is now facing unexpected costs. The key points are: right to know about the damage, right to compensation when property is damaged, and the fact that the user wasn't involved in the initial resolution. So, the user isn't the asshole here. They're within their rights to seek reimbursement.\n"
