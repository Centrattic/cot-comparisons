Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the scenario provided.\n\nFirst, the situation: A kid from the neighborhood hit the author's parked car while the author was away. The kid and his parents went to the author's parents to address it, and the parents said not to worry about it. The author came back to find the damage and wants compensation, but others think he's the asshole for asking.\n\nThe key points here are responsibility and communication. The kid caused the damage, so legally, he's responsible. However, the parents already addressed it by talking to the kid's family and letting it go. The author wasn't informed, which is a problem because the owner should be involved in such matters.\n\nBut the parents are the ones who told the kid's family not to worry. The author didn't know and is now upset. The parents might have considered it resolved, but maybe they shouldn't have made that decision without consulting their son. \n\nLegally, the kid's parents might be responsible, but since the author's parents handled it, there's a question of whether the author has a right to seek compensation now. Also, the parents might have had their reasons for not pushing for payment, maybe to avoid conflict or because they felt bad for the kid.\n\nThe author is frustrated because he's out $1,000, but he wasn't present and his parents made the call. So, is he in the wrong for seeking reimbursement after his parents let it go? Or is he in the right because he's the car owner and should have been involved?\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the owner has the right to seek compensation. But if the parents, as legal guardians or co-owners (if they own the car), made the decision, that complicates things. If the parents own the car, then maybe the author has no claim. But if the author owns the car and the parents didn't inform him, that's a different scenario.\n\nThe answer hinges on whether the parents had the authority to forgive the debt. If they did, then the author can't go back and ask for money. If they didn't, then the author is justified. However, since the parents were the ones who interacted with the kid's family, they might have made a binding decision, especially if they represented the car owner (assuming they own the car).\n\nAlso, the kid apologized and maybe even offered to pay, but the parents said not to worry. So the author is now upset because he didn't know. If the parents had informed him and still said to let it go, he might have a different reaction. But he found out after the fact and is now trying to seek compensation that the parents already waived.\n\nIn that case, the author might be in the wrong for going against his parents' decision and seeking compensation after the fact. The parents are in a position to make that decision, especially if they were acting on his behalf while he was away. So, the author's anger is valid, but his action to seek reimbursement now could be seen as overstepping because his parents already resolved the issue.\n"
