Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. The situation is that the neighbor's kid hit their parked car while they were abroad. The parents were told but didn't inform the author, and no one offered compensation. Now the author is upset about the $1,000 damage and is being told they're the asshole for wanting reimbursement.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is at fault. The kid caused the damage, so he's responsible. The parents were at the scene and even offered to pay but were told not to worry. However, the author wasn't informed, which is a problem because they're the car owner. The parents might have resolved it on their own, but the author has a right to know about the damage to their property.\n\nThe key points are: the kid caused the damage, the parents were present but didn't inform the car owner, and the author is seeking compensation. Legally, the responsible party (the kid) should cover the costs. The parents might have settled it, but without consulting the author, which is an issue. The author isn't at fault for asking for reimbursement; they\u2019re the victim here. So the answer should be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
