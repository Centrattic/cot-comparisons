  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not wanting to call my stepfather \"Dad\"?\nSo hear me out. In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the writer's stepfather and their refusal to call him \"Dad.\" The writer's mom got divorced and remarried, and the stepfather isn't close with the writer. They argue a lot, and the writer isn't comfortable calling him dad. The mom got angry when the writer corrected her, leading to a cold war.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The writer's mom wants her child to accept the new husband as a father figure. But the stepfather hasn't made an effort to bond, and the writer feels it's not genuine. The mom's reaction was harsh, calling the writer ungrateful. \n\nIs the writer wrong for not calling him dad? Well, calling someone \"Dad\" is a personal choice. If the stepfather hasn't built a relationship, the writer isn't obligated to use that term. The mom's expectations might be reasonable, but if the stepfather isn't fulfilling the role, forcing the title could be unfair.\n\nThe stepfather's behavior\u2014arguing with the mom and not trying to know the child\u2014suggests he hasn't earned that title. The writer's response was factual, not hostile. The mom's anger seems disproportionate if the stepfather isn't acting like a father. \n\nSo, the writer isn't wrong for not calling him dad. The problem lies with the mom expecting acceptance without the stepfather making an effort. The writer's stance is valid. Answer B.\n"
