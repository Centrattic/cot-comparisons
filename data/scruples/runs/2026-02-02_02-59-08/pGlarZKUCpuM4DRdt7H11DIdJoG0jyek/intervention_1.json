In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" The situation involves a blended family where the parents are divorced, and the mom has remarried. The stepfather isn't close to the kid, they argue, and the mom is upset when the kid doesn't refer to him as \"father.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The stepfather hasn't really tried to build a relationship, and their interactions are mostly negative. The kid is not comfortable calling him \"Dad,\" which is a valid emotional response. The mom is upset, calling the kid ungrateful, but the kid's stance is based on their actual experiences.\n\nLegally, the stepfather isn't the biological father, so there's no legal right to be called \"Dad.\" Socially, people choose family titles based on their relationships. The kid's refusal isn't just about a name; it's about not recognizing someone as a father when the relationship doesn't support that role. The mom's reaction seems to stem from wanting the stepfather to be accepted, but the kid's feelings are valid given the lack of a positive relationship.\n\nThe key points here are the stepfather's lack of effort, the negative interactions, and the kid's right to feel how they do. The author isn't in the wrong for expressing their true feelings, even if it upsets their mom. The mom's anger might be more about her own expectations than the kid's actions. So, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
