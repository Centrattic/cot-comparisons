In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person in the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong for not calling their stepfather \"Dad.\" Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the parents got divorced, the mom remarried, and the stepdad hasn't really tried to connect with the kid. They have arguments, and the kid doesn't feel close to him. The mom refers to the stepdad as \"your father,\" and the kid objects, saying he's not their dad. The mom gets angry, calls the kid ungrateful, and they haven't spoken much since.\n\nSo, the kid is questioning whether it's wrong to not call their stepfather Dad. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to consider both sides.\n\nFrom the kid's perspective: They have a strained relationship with the stepdad. The stepdad hasn't made an effort to connect, and there's a lot of arguing. The term \"Dad\" is a big deal because it implies a father-son relationship. If the kid doesn't see the stepdad as a father figure, it's natural to object. Using the term might feel forced or disrespectful, especially if the stepdad hasn't earned it.\n\nFrom the mom's perspective: She's trying to integrate the stepdad into the family, maybe wanting the kid to accept him as part of their new family structure. She might feel that the kid is being disrespectful or ungrateful by not using the term, especially if she's put effort into building that relationship. However, if the stepdad hasn't been supportive or kind, the kid's resistance is understandable.\n\nBut here's the thing: Family dynamics are complex. The mom has the right to remarry and form a new family, but the kid has the right to form their own relationship with the stepdad. The kid isn't obligated to call someone \"Dad\" if there's no genuine relationship. The mom's reaction might be harsh if she's not considering the kid's feelings about the stepdad's behavior.\n\nAlso, the stepdad's lack of effort is a key factor. If he hasn't tried to build a relationship, the kid isn't in the wrong for not extending that kind of respect or title. The term \"Dad\" is a sign of a father-son bond, which the kid hasn't experienced with the stepdad.\n\nHowever, the mom's frustration is valid. She might feel her remarriage is being dismissed. But the kid's response was factual rather than disrespectful. It's possible the mom expected the kid to use the term to show acceptance, but if the kid isn't comfortable, that's their right.\n\nIn conclusion, the kid isn't in the wrong for not calling the stepdad \"Dad.\" They have valid reasons based on the stepdad's lack of engagement and the existing tension. The mom's anger might stem from her own expectations not being met, but the kid's actions are justified given the circumstances.\n"
