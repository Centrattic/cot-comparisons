In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" The situation involves a divorce, remarriage, and tension between the mom and stepdad. The author's mom called the stepdad \"your father,\" and the author replied that he's not their dad. The mom got angry, saying the author is ungrateful and hasn't accepted him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The stepfather hasn't tried to get to know the author, there are frequent arguments, and interactions are strained. The author feels the stepdad isn't a real father to them. The mom expects the author to accept the stepdad as a father figure, but the author resists. \n\nIs it wrong to not want to call someone \"Dad\" if the relationship isn't there? The author's feelings are valid because family titles often depend on the actual relationship. The stepdad isn't fulfilling the role of a father, so the author's refusal isn't necessarily disrespectful. However, the mom's reaction might stem from wanting to create a unified family environment, which is understandable. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's response was factual, not confrontational. The mom's anger might be more about her own expectations or sensitivity about her marriage. The author isn't in the wrong for expressing their true feelings about a relationship that hasn't developed as expected. The key is that the title \"Dad\" implies a certain level of closeness and acceptance, which hasn't been achieved here. Therefore, the author isn't the asshole for maintaining their stance.\n"
