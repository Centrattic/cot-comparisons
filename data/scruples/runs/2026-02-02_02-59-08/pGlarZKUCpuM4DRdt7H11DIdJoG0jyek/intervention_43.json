In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" The author explains that their parents divorced, their mom remarried, and they don't get along well with the stepdad. The mom called him \"your father,\" and the author said he's not their dad, which upset the mom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author's mom wants them to accept her new husband as a father figure. But the author has a strained relationship with the stepdad, mentioning arguments and lack of effort from the stepdad to get to know them. The mom got angry when the author didn't refer to him as \"Dad,\" labeling the author as ungrateful.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the mom is trying to integrate the stepfather into the family, but if the stepfather hasn't made an effort to build a relationship, the author's reluctance makes sense. The author's response was factual, not hostile. The mom's anger might be more about her own feelings or expectations rather than the author being unreasonable. The key points are the stepfather's lack of effort and the author's valid feelings. So, the author isn't the asshole here. Answer B.\n"
