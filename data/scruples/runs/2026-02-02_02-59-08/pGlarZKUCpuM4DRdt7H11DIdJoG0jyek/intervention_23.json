In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" The situation involves a recent divorce, remarriage, and tension between the mother and stepfather, as well as between the stepfather and the child. \n\nFirst, the author's mom refers to the stepfather as \"your father,\" and the author responds by saying he's not their dad. The mom gets angry, calling the author ungrateful and not accepting him. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion.\n\nI need to consider family dynamics here. The stepfather isn't the biological father, and the author hasn't had a positive relationship with him. The author mentions that the stepfather hasn't tried to get to know them and there are frequent arguments. The key point is the author's right to choose how they refer to stepfamily members. \n\nIn many cultures, people aren't forced to adopt new familial terms if they don't feel comfortable. The author's response was a factual statement from their perspective. The mom's reaction is more about her expectations versus the author's feelings. \n\nThe stepfather hasn't earned the title \"father\" in the author's eyes due to the lack of effort and the negative interactions. The author isn't obligated to use a title that doesn't feel genuine. However, the mom's frustration might stem from her desire for the family to be cohesive. But the author's stance is about their own feelings and experiences, which are valid. \n\nSo, considering the author's justified feelings and the lack of a genuine relationship, it's more about the mother's reaction being out of proportion rather than the author being in the wrong. Therefore, the answer should be B (not in the wrong).\n"
