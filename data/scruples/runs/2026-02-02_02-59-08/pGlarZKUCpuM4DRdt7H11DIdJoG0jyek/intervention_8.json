In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The parents divorced, the mom remarried, and the stepdad hasn't really tried to connect with the kid. They argue a lot, and the stepdad isn't nice. The author felt he's not their dad and said so, leading to the mom being upset.\n\nThe main issue is the emotional dynamics here. The mom wants the author to accept her new husband as a father figure, but the author is resisting due to the stepdad's behavior. Is the author wrong for not calling him \"Dad\"? Well, the stepdad hasn't made an effort to build a relationship, so the author's reluctance makes sense. The mom's reaction is about wanting acceptance, but if the stepdad hasn't earned that title through his actions, the author isn't obligated. The mom might feel hurt, but the author's feelings are valid too. So, the answer would likely be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
