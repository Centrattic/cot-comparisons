In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" The situation involves a family where the parents got divorced, the mother remarried, and the stepfather isn't close with the child. The conflict arises when the mother refers to the stepfather as \"your father,\" and the child objects, leading to a fallout.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives. The child's position is that the stepfather isn't their dad because of the lack of a close relationship and the arguments between the parents. The mother is upset because she wants the child to accept her new husband as part of the family. \n\nFrom a traditional standpoint, some might argue that since the stepfather is in a legal marriage with the mother, he has a parental role by marriage. However, the child's feelings about the relationship are valid. The stepfather hasn't made an effort to connect, and the child has a right to not feel forced into a familial role they don't believe exists. \n\nThe mother's reaction could be seen as harsh. Telling the child they're ungrateful and cutting off communication might be an overreaction. The child's statement was factual based on their experience, not disrespectful. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a complex situation. The child isn't obligated to call someone \"Dad\" if they don't see them as a father. The mother's expectations might be unrealistic given the current dynamics. The key points are the child's feelings and the stepfather's lack of involvement. The author isn't in the wrong for standing by their feelings.\n"
