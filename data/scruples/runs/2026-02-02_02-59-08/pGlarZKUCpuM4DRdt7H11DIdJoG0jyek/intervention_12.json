In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" The situation involves divorce, remarriage, and some tension. The mother refers to the stepfather as \"your father,\" and the author objects, saying he's not their dad. The mom got angry and hasn't spoken to them since.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author isn't comfortable with the stepfather, who they describe as not trying to know them and having arguments. The mother is pushing for the stepfather to be called \"Dad,\" which the author resists. The key issue is the expectation of a title versus the emotional reality.\n\nTitles in families can be tricky. Some people feel that a legal or marital status automatically grants certain titles, but others believe it's about the relationship and emotional bond. The author's stepfather hasn't tried to build a relationship, so the author's resistance is understandable. The mother's reaction could be seen as dismissive of the son's feelings, prioritizing her new marriage over her child's comfort. \n\nIs the author wrong for not using the title? It's a personal choice, and if the stepfather isn't fulfilling the role of a father, it's reasonable. However, the way the author responded might have come off as abrupt, but the user says it was a matter-of-fact statement, not angry. The mom's anger seems disproportionate if the stepfather isn't a positive figure in the child's life. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (the author isn't in the wrong) because the title is about the relationship and the author's feelings matter. The mom might be in the wrong for not respecting the child's feelings, especially if the stepfather isn't a supportive figure. The author isn't obligated to use a title if it doesn't feel right to them.\n"
