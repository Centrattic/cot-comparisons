In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" The person's parents are divorced, and their mom remarried. They don't get along with their stepdad, who isn't very nice and there's a lot of arguing. When the mom calls him \"your father,\" the person says he's not their dad, which made the mom angry.\n\nHmm. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. So, first, I need to evaluate the situation. The stepfather is their mom's husband, but they have a strained relationship. The person is 18 or older, probably, since they're living with their mom and dealing with stepfamily dynamics. The key points are the stepfather's behavior, the mom's expectations, and the person's right to set boundaries.\n\nThe person's mom is upset because they didn't accept her husband as the father. But the stepfather hasn't made an effort to connect, and their interactions are negative. The person is asserting their feelings, which is a natural response when they don't feel the bond. The mom is hurt because she wants her child to accept the marriage, but the child isn't comfortable. \n\nIs the person wrong for not calling him \"Dad\"? Well, family dynamics can be complex. Using a title like \"Dad\" is a personal choice. The stepfather isn't a biological parent, and if the relationship is strained, the person isn't obligated to use that term. The mom's anger might be more about her own feelings of rejection than the stepfather's actual actions. \n\nBut the person's response was a factual statement, not aggressive. They said \"he's not my dad\" as a matter of fact, which is valid given the context. The mom's reaction of calling them ungrateful and not speaking to them seems harsh. The person isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries or expressing their feelings. \n\nSo, the answer is B. The author is not in the wrong. They have a right to their feelings and the stepfather's lack of effort makes the situation more complicated. The mom's reaction is more about her own expectations not being met. The person isn't obligated to use a title they don't feel comfortable with.\n"
