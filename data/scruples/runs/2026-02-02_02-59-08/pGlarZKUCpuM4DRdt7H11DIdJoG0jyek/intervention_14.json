In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The parents divorced a few years ago, the mom remarried, and the new husband (stepfather) isn't very close with the author. They argue a lot, and the stepfather hasn't tried to get to know the author. When the mom starts calling the stepfather \"your father,\" the author reacts by saying he's not their dad. The mom gets angry, calls them ungrateful, and hasn't spoken to them since.\n\nSo, the key points here are the strained relationship between the author and the stepfather, the mom's reaction to the author not using the term \"Dad,\" and the resulting fallout. The author is wondering if they're the asshole for standing their ground.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, it's important to consider both sides. The author's mom might feel rejected because she wants her child to accept her new husband, maybe seeing it as a step towards building a family unit. On the other hand, the author isn't obligated to call someone \"Dad\" if they don't feel connected to them. The stepfather's behavior (not trying to connect and arguing) likely contributes to the author's resistance.\n\nThe author's response was factual but might have been blunt. Maybe a more diplomatic approach could have helped, but the core issue is the mother's insistence on a title that the author doesn't feel comfortable using. The mom's anger seems to stem from feeling ungrateful, but the author has valid reasons for their stance.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a gray area. However, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for not wanting to call someone \"Dad\" if there's no bond. The mom's reaction might be over the top, but the author could have handled it differently. Still, the answer hinges on whether the author's refusal is justified by the lack of relationship. I think the author isn't in the wrong because they aren't required to use a title that doesn't feel authentic given the circumstances.\n"
