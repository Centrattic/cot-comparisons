In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about whether or not to call the stepfather \"Dad.\" The user's mom got divorced and remarried, and the stepdad isn't really close to the author. They argue a lot, and the stepdad hasn't tried to connect. The author just says \"he's not my dad\" when the mom refers to him as \"your father,\" leading to the mom being upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author's mom is trying to integrate the stepdad into their family, maybe in a parental role. But the author feels that the stepdad hasn't earned that title. The mom might be expecting the author to accept him as a father figure, but the author isn't comfortable because the stepdad hasn't made an effort.\n\nIs the author being disrespectful? Well, the author didn't say it in anger, just stated a fact. But in some family contexts, especially if the mom is trying to move forward, not using the term \"Dad\" might be seen as not accepting the new family structure. However, the stepdad hasn't acted like a father, so maybe the author is justified in not using the term. The mom's anger could come from feeling that the author is rejecting her new spouse, which might affect their relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's right to feel that way is valid. People can set boundaries about how they refer to others. If the stepdad isn't fulfilling the role, it's reasonable to not use the title. The issue might be more about the author's mom's expectations versus the author's feelings.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? It depends on perspective. If the mom is hurt because she wants the author to accept him, then the author might be seen as not respecting her new marriage. But if the stepdad hasn't earned that title, the author isn't wrong to not use it. The key is the stepdad's actions (or lack thereof) and the author's right to define their relationship. Since the stepdad hasn't made an effort, the author isn't in the wrong for not calling him \"Dad.\" So, the answer is B.\n"
