In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The parents got divorced, the mom remarried, and the stepdad isn't really close with the kid. They argue a lot, and the stepdad hasn't tried to get to know the kid. The kid doesn't want to call him \"Dad,\" and when the mom called him \"your father,\" the kid said he's not my dad. The mom got angry, called the kid ungrateful, and hasn't spoken to him since.\n\nSo, the question is, is the kid in the wrong here? The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI think the key points here are the kid's feelings and the stepdad's behavior. The kid has reasons not to want to call him Dad\u2014like the stepdad not making an effort to connect and their arguments. The mom might be feeling hurt because she expects the kid to accept her new husband. But the kid's reaction seems to be based on genuine discomfort and the stepdad not being a father figure. \n\nFrom a psychological standpoint, children often need time to adjust to a stepparent, especially if the marriage is recent. The stepdad hasn't earned the title by building a relationship. The mom's anger might stem from her desire for the family to feel united, but the kid's feelings are valid. \n\nIn terms of social norms, there's no rule that says you must call a stepparent by a certain title. It's a personal choice. The kid isn't obligated to use a title that doesn't feel right to them, especially if the relationship isn't there. The mom's reaction seems harsh because she's upset, but the kid isn't wrong for not wanting to use that term. \n\nSo, considering the dynamics, the answer is probably B (the author is not in the wrong). The kid has valid reasons for their stance, and the mom's response is more about her own expectations than the kid's right to feel comfortable.\n"
