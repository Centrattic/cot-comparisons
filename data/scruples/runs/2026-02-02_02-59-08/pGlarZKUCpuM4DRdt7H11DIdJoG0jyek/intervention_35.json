In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" The situation involves a complicated family dynamic after a divorce and remarriage.\n\nFirst, the author's mom remarried two years ago. The stepfather isn't particularly close with the author, they argue a lot, and there are issues between the mom and stepdad. When the mom refers to him as \"your father,\" the author reacts by saying \"he's not my dad,\" which leads to the mom being upset and cutting off communication.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, the stepfather hasn't tried to build a relationship, which is a valid point. The author might feel that calling someone \"Dad\" implies a closer, more accepting relationship than what exists. The mother, on the other hand, might feel that the author isn't respecting the new family structure or being grateful for the stepfather's presence.\n\nLegally, the stepfather isn't the biological father, but the mother might consider him a parent in a social or legal sense now. However, the author's feelings are important. If the stepfather hasn't earned the title through effort, it's understandable the author resists. The key here is the mother's reaction. If she's insisting on the title without acknowledging the existing tension, she might be putting pressure on the author to conform to a role that doesn't fit the reality of their relationship.\n\nThe author's response was factual but could be seen as dismissive. The mother might feel disrespected, but the root issue is the lack of connection with the stepfather. The author isn't wrong for not wanting to use the title if the relationship isn't there. The mother's anger might stem from feeling that the author isn't accepting her new marriage, but the author isn't obligated to pretend the stepfather is a father if it's not true.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the author isn't in the wrong for expressing their feelings, even if the tone could be smoother. The mother's reaction is perhaps more about her own expectations than the author's right to feel that way.\n"
