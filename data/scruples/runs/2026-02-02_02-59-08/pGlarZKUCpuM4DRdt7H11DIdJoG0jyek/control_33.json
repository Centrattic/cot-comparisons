In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" Their mom got remarried after a divorce, and they don't get along with the stepdad. He's okay but doesn't make an effort to connect, and he argues with their mom a lot. The user called him out by saying he's not their dad when the mom used that term, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, the user's stance. They have valid reasons: the stepdad hasn't tried to get to know them, there are arguments, and the stepdad isn't nice. Using the term \"Dad\" implies a certain level of relationship and acceptance that isn't there. So from the user's perspective, it's about respect and authenticity. They shouldn't have to use a title that doesn't feel right, especially if the stepdad isn't fulfilling the role.\n\nOn the mom's side, she might feel that the user isn't respecting her new marriage or showing gratitude. But the user's resistance isn't about rejecting the mom's new spouse but about the relationship dynamics. The mom's anger could stem from feeling that her choice isn't being supported, but if the stepdad isn't making an effort, the user isn't obligated to adopt the title.\n\nAlso, the user's response was factual, not hostile. They didn't lash out but stated a fact. The mom's reaction seems extreme, as the user's statement is about their own feelings and experiences. The stepdad's behavior and the lack of effort on his part contribute to the user's stance.\n\nSo, the user isn't in the wrong. They have legitimate reasons for their resistance. The mom's anger might be misplaced since the user is just being honest about their relationship. The key points are the stepdad's lack of effort and the user's right to self-determination in family titles. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
