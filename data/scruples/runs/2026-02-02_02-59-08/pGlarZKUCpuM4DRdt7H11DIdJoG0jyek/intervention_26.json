In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person's parents divorced, the mom remarried, and the stepdad hasn't really connected with them. There are arguments between the stepdad and mom, and the person is uncomfortable with the stepdad. When the mom refers to him as \"your father,\" the person reacts by saying he's not their dad. The mom got angry, called them ungrateful, and hasn't talked to them since. The question is if the author is in the wrong.\n\nThe user says they think the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. Let me consider the factors. The person has valid reasons for not wanting to call the stepdad \"Dad\"\u2014the stepdad hasn't tried to bond, there are arguments, and the relationship isn't positive. The mom's reaction seems harsh. But maybe the mom feels the person isn't respecting the marriage or being accepting. \n\nOn one hand, the person's feelings are understandable. They might not feel a paternal bond with the stepdad. On the other hand, the mom might expect them to make an effort for her sake. However, the stepdad hasn't tried to connect either. The key is whether the person is at fault. They didn't act out of malice; they stated facts about the stepdad's behavior. The mom's anger seems disproportionate. So, the person isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're expressing their true feelings, which are justified given the circumstances. Therefore, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
