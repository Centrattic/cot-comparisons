In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person (AITA) is wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" The situation is that the parents are divorced, the mom remarried, and the stepdad isn't close to the kid. There are arguments between the mom and stepdad, and the kid and stepdad argue too. The mom called the stepdad \"your father,\" and the kid responded \"he's not my dad,\" which upset the mom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The kid's biological father is presumably not part of the picture now. The stepfather is the mom's new husband, but the kid hasn't developed a close relationship with him. The mom is upset that the kid doesn't call him \"Dad,\" which she sees as a lack of acceptance. \n\nThe kid's perspective is that the stepfather hasn't tried to get to know them and they have issues. So, the kid's refusal to call him \"Dad\" seems to come from a place of genuine discomfort or lack of relationship. The mom might feel that the kid isn't respecting her new marriage or not giving the stepfather the recognition he's seeking. \n\nIs the kid in the wrong? Well, it's about personal feelings and family dynamics. The kid isn't obligated to call someone \"Dad\" if there's no emotional connection. However, the mom's feelings are hurt because she might want the family to be cohesive. But the kid's response was factual and not malicious. The mom's anger over being called \"ungrateful\" might be overreacting. The stepfather's behavior (not trying to connect, arguing) could contribute to the kid's stance. \n\nIn many cases, the name \"Dad\" is a personal choice. If the stepfather isn't playing the role of a father in the kid's life, the kid isn't wrong for not using that term. The mom's reaction might be unreasonable if she's pressuring the kid beyond what's comfortable. So, the answer might lean towards B (the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
