In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad\" after their parents' divorce and remarriage. The person's mom got remarried two years ago, and the stepfather (let's call him SF) hasn't really tried to connect with them. They argue a lot, and the SF isn't nice. The mom calls him \"your father,\" and the person says, \"he's not my dad,\" which upset the mom. Now the mom is angry and hasn't spoken to them since.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The person's mom is trying to integrate the SF into the family, maybe expecting the child to accept him as a father figure. However, the SF hasn't made efforts to bond with the child, and there are arguments between the mom and SF. The child's resistance to calling him \"Dad\" might stem from genuine discomfort or past experiences. \n\nIs the child in the wrong? Well, the child isn't obligated to call someone \"Dad\" if they didn't build that relationship. However, the way they reacted might have been abrupt. The mom was trying to refer to him as \"father,\" which could be part of her effort to legitimize the new family structure. The child's statement, while factual, might have been hurtful to the mom's feelings, especially if she wanted the child to accept the SF. \n\nBut the child's perspective is valid too. If the SF hasn't tried to connect, it's not fair to expect a title. The mom might be projecting her own desires onto the child without considering their feelings. However, the child's response could have been more considerate. Instead of saying \"he's not my dad,\" maybe they could have explained their feelings without dismissing the mom's perspective. \n\nThe mom's anger and not speaking to the child seems excessive, but the child's refusal to use a title might have been a trigger. The key points are mutual understanding. The child isn't in the wrong for not wanting to call SF \"Dad,\" but maybe their communication could have been better. The question is whether the child is in the wrong. Since the SF hasn't established a fatherly relationship, the child isn't obligated. The mom's reaction is harsh, but the child's response might have been too direct. \n\nHmm, the answer is probably B (not in the wrong) because the child has valid reasons for not using the title. The mom should consider the child's feelings and the SF's behavior before expecting such a label.\n"
