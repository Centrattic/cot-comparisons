In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not calling their stepfather \"Dad.\" The situation is that the parents divorced, the mom remarried, and the stepdad isn't great. The author's mom got angry when the author said the stepdad isn't their dad.\n\nHmm. The user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to figure out if that's the case. The author's mom called them ungrateful and hasn't spoken to them since. The stepdad isn't close with the author, argues with the mom, and the author feels uncomfortable.\n\nFirst, does the author have a valid reason for not calling the stepdad \"Dad\"? If the stepdad hasn't made efforts to build a relationship, maybe the author isn't obligated to use that term. Family dynamics can be complex. Using a term like \"Dad\" usually signifies a close, parental relationship. If the stepdad isn't fulfilling that role, the author might not see the need.\n\nBut the mom might feel hurt because she's trying to integrate the stepdad into the family. She might see the author's refusal as rejecting her new marriage or being disrespectful. However, the author's point is valid if the stepdad isn't acting like a father figure. The mom's reaction seems harsh, given the stepdad's behavior and their strained relationship.\n\nIs the author being ungrateful? It's possible the mom wants the author to accept the stepdad despite the issues. But if the stepdad hasn't tried to connect and there's conflict, the author's resistance makes sense. The mom's anger might stem from feeling the author isn't supporting her new family structure, but the author isn't in the wrong for not forcing a relationship that's not there.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have valid reasons for not using the term \"Dad.\" The mom's reaction is more about her perspective, but the author's stance is justified given the circumstances.\n"
