In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The parents are divorced, the mom is remarried now. The stepfather hasn't really tried to connect with the author and they argue a lot. The mom refers to him as \"your father,\" and the author says, \"he's not my dad,\" leading to a conflict.\n\nSo, the key points here are the stepfather's behavior\u2014being distant, arguments with the mom, and the author's refusal to use the term \"Dad.\" The mom is upset that the author isn't accepting her new husband as the father figure.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the stepfather hasn't made an effort to bond or be nice, so the author's reluctance makes sense. On the other hand, the mom might feel that by not calling him \"Dad,\" the author is rejecting the new family structure or being disrespectful.\n\nBut the question is about whether the author is wrong. From a personal autonomy perspective, people can choose how they refer to family members. If the stepfather hasn't earned that title or if the relationship isn't there, the author isn't obligated to use it. The mom might be projecting her own expectations here, but the author's feelings and experiences are valid too.\n\nAlso, the stepfather's behavior is a factor. If he's not making an effort, the author's resistance isn't unfounded. It's not about being ungrateful if the stepfather hasn't provided anything significant. The term \"Dad\" usually implies a certain relationship, which isn't present here.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for stating a fact that the stepfather isn't a father figure to them. The mom's reaction might be harsh, but the author's stance is reasonable given the context.\n"
