In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The parents are divorced, the mom remarried, and the stepdad isn't close with the kid. They argue, and the kid doesn't feel comfortable calling him dad. The mom got upset when the kid corrected her.\n\nThe key points here are the kid's feelings and the mom's expectations. The stepdad isn't a positive figure in the kid's life; they argue, and he hasn't tried to bond. The kid's response was factual, not hostile. The mom's reaction might stem from wanting to present the stepdad as a father figure.\n\nLegally, the stepdad isn't the biological father, but the mom might expect respect. However, forcing a title can be problematic if the relationship is strained. The kid isn't obligated to use the term if it's not genuine. The mom's anger might be more about her own feelings than the kid's right to feel uncomfortable. \n\nIn terms of social norms, titles like \"Dad\" can be personal. If the stepdad isn't fulfilling the role, the kid's refusal isn't necessarily wrong. The mom's reaction could be seen as invalidating the kid's feelings. \n\nI think the kid isn't in the wrong here because they're expressing their genuine feelings. The mom's reaction is harsh, expecting acceptance of someone who isn't a positive presence. So the answer is B.\n"
