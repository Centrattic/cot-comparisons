  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not wanting to call my stepfather \"Dad\"?\nSo hear me out. In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not calling their stepfather \"Dad.\" Their parents are divorced, and their mom remarried. The stepdad isn't close to them, there are arguments between him and the mom, and the stepdad hasn't tried to bond. The mom called him \"your father,\" and the person responded with \"he's not my dad,\" which upset the mom.\n\nFirst, the user's reasoning: They feel the stepfather isn't a father figure because of the lack of connection and the negative environment. The mom wants them to accept him, but the user isn't comfortable. \n\nLegally or socially, a stepfather doesn't automatically become a father figure. The user has a right to feel how they do about family roles. The mom's reaction might be from her own expectations or pressure. The user's statement was factual from their perspective, even if it hurt feelings. The mom's anger could be about rejection, but the user isn't obligated to accept someone they don't see as a parent. \n\nSo, the user isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
