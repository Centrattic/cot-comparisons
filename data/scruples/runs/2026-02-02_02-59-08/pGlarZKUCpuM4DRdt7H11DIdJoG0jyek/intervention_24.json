In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand the details. The parents are divorced, the mom is remarried. The stepdad isn't very close to the author, there are arguments between the mom and stepdad, and the mom called him \"your father,\" leading to the author saying he's not their dad. The mom got angry and hasn't spoken to them since.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to decide between A (Yes, author wrong) or B (No, not wrong). \n\nFactors to consider: The author's right to choose how they address family, the stepdad's relationship with them, and the mom's reaction. The author mentions the stepdad doesn't try to know them and they argue a lot. So, the author might have valid reasons not to call him dad. The mom's anger might be because she expects the author to accept the stepdad as a father figure, but if the stepdad isn't a good one, maybe the author isn't obligated. \n\nBut some might argue that respecting the mom's choice and using the term is important for family harmony. However, if the stepdad isn't acting like a father, the author isn't being disrespectful by not using the term. The key is whether the author is wrong for not calling him \"Dad.\" The author isn't being rude; they're stating a fact that he isn't their biological father. The stepdad's role isn't fulfilling a father figure, so the author's stance is understandable. The mom's reaction might be unreasonable if she's pushing for acceptance without effort from the stepdad. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they have a valid reason based on their experiences with the stepdad. The mom's expectations might be misplaced given the stepdad's behavior. So the answer is B.\n"
