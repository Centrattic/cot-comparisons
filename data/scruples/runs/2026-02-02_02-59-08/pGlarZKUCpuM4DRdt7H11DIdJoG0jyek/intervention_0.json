In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're the asshole for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" Their parents got divorced, and the mom remarried. The stepdad isn't great\u2014doesn't try to get to know them, they argue a lot, and he's not nice. The mom called him \"your father,\" and the kid said he's not their dad, which upset her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the kid's perspective. They might feel that since the stepdad isn't their biological father and hasn't been a positive presence, using the term \"Dad\" is forcing a relationship they don't want. The stepdad's behavior and the mom's arguments with him might make the kid uncomfortable. The kid's response was factual, not angry, but the mom took it as ungrateful.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom probably wants the kid to accept the stepdad as a family figure. She might see using the term \"father\" as a way to legitimize the marriage and create a sense of unity. The kid not calling him that could be seen as rejecting the new family structure, which upsets her.\n\nBut then, should the kid have to address someone they don't feel connected to as \"Dad\"? If the stepdad hasn't made efforts to build a relationship, is the kid obligated to use that term? The kid's feelings are valid here. Family dynamics are complex, and forcing a title might not be fair if there's no mutual respect or effort on the stepdad's part.\n\nThe mom's reaction might stem from wanting her new husband to be recognized as a father figure, but if the stepdad isn't fulfilling that role, maybe the kid isn't in the wrong for not using the term. The key factors are the stepdad's lack of effort and the kid's genuine discomfort. The mom's anger could be misplaced if she's expecting the kid to accept someone who hasn't earned that role.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong). The kid has valid reasons for not wanting to use the term, especially considering the stepdad's behavior. However, communication issues between the mom and kid might need addressing, but the kid's stance isn't necessarily wrong.\n"
