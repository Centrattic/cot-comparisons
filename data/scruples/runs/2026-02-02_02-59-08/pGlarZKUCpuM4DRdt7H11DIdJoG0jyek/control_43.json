In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" The situation involves a divorced mom who remarried, and the stepdad isn't close with the child. The stepdad hasn't made an effort to bond, they argue a lot, and the author isn't comfortable referring to him as \"Dad.\" The mom got upset when the author corrected her, leading to a rift.\n\nFirst, the author's perspective: They have valid reasons\u2014stepdad isn't close, hasn't tried to connect, and their relationship is strained. The author's response was factual and not confrontational. The mom's reaction seems harsh, especially since the author isn't in the wrong for feeling that way. The stepdad's lack of effort and the mom's insistence on the title might be causing tension.\n\nThe mom's reaction: She's upset that the author doesn't accept her husband as a father figure. But does the author have to? Titles can be personal. The author isn't obligated to use a title they're uncomfortable with, especially if the relationship isn't there. The mom's anger might stem from her own expectations or pressure to have a good relationship with the stepdad, but that doesn't make the author wrong.\n\nConsidering boundaries and respect: The author is within their rights to set boundaries. The stepdad isn't a biological parent and hasn't earned the title through effort. The mom's reaction could be seen as invalidating the author's feelings. The key here is that the author isn't being disrespectful; they're stating a fact based on their experiences.\n\nIn terms of AITA, the author isn't the asshole. They're standing by their feelings and the reality of their relationship with the stepdad. The mom's anger is misplaced here. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
