In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong for not calling their stepfather \"Dad.\" The situation is that the parents divorced, the mother remarried, and the stepfather isn't very close to the kid. The stepfather and mom argue a lot, and the kid doesn't like him. When the mom calls the stepdad \"your father,\" the kid says he's not their dad, which upsets the mom, leading to a big argument.\n\nHmm. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. Let me break this down. The key points here are the feelings of the stepfather, the mother's reaction, and the kid's perspective. \n\nFirst, the kid has a valid reason not to call the stepfather \"Dad.\" They\u2019ve had arguments, the stepfather hasn\u2019t really tried to bond, and they have a strained relationship. The kid might not feel that the stepfather is a father figure, so calling him \"Dad\" could feel inauthentic or forced. That makes sense. \n\nOn the other hand, the mother is upset because she wants the kid to accept her new husband as part of the family. She uses the term \"your father,\" which the kid rejects. The mother might feel that the kid is being disrespectful or ungrateful, especially if she's trying to integrate the stepfather into the family dynamic. \n\nNow, is the kid in the wrong? Well, the kid isn't being malicious. They're expressing their genuine feelings. The mother, however, might not realize the depth of the kid's discomfort. The problem here could be communication. The kid could have explained their feelings instead of just stating \"he's not my dad.\" But the mother's reaction seems harsh, especially if she's been trying to push the acceptance without considering the kid's perspective. \n\nIn terms of fault, the kid isn't necessarily wrong for feeling that way. Family dynamics are complex, and forcing a nickname like \"Dad\" when it doesn't feel right can be hurtful. The mother's anger might stem from her own hurt feelings or pressure to present a united front. However, the kid's statement was factual from their point of view. They\u2019re not wrong for not wanting to call someone \"Dad\" if they don't see them as a father figure. \n\nBut maybe the kid could have approached the situation differently. Saying \"he's not my dad\" can come off as dismissive, even if it's not meant to be angry. The mother might have felt disrespected. However, the core issue is the strained relationship and lack of genuine connection. The mother's expectation might be unrealistic given the circumstances. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the kid isn't in the wrong. They\u2019re expressing their true feelings about their stepfather, which isn't something they can force themselves to change. The mother needs to work on understanding the kid's perspective instead of expecting them to accept the stepfather as a father figure without building that relationship first.\n"
