In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not calling their stepfather \"Dad.\" Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The writer's parents divorced, and their mom remarried about two years ago. The stepfather isn't close with the writer, they have arguments, and their mom and stepdad also argue a lot. The mom called him \"your father,\" and the writer said he's not their dad. The mom got angry, called the writer ungrateful, and hasn't spoken to them since. The question is whether the writer is the asshole here.\n\nHmm. Well, the writer's mom wants them to refer to her new husband as \"father,\" but the writer has a negative relationship with him. The stepdad hasn't tried to build a relationship and they argue. So the writer's resistance seems justified. The mom is pushing for acceptance, but if the stepdad hasn't earned that title through positive interaction, maybe the writer isn't wrong to not call him dad. \n\nBut from the mom's perspective, she's trying to integrate her new husband into the family, and the writer's refusal might feel disrespectful. However, the writer isn't in the wrong if the stepdad hasn't made efforts to connect. The key factors are the lack of effort from the stepdad and the writer's valid feelings. The mom's anger might stem from feeling that the writer isn't respecting her marriage, but the writer's stance is based on their actual relationship dynamics.\n\nI think the answer here leans towards the author not being in the wrong. They have a legitimate reason not to call someone \"Dad\" if the relationship isn't there. The mom's reaction seems harsh given the circumstances. So the answer is B.\n"
