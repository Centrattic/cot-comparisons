In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" The situation is that the parents are divorced, the mom remarried, and the stepdad isn't close with the kid. They argue a lot, and the mom called the stepdad \"your father,\" which led to the author saying he's not their dad. The mom got upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The stepdad hasn't tried to get close, and their interactions are tense. The author's mom is pushing for the stepdad to be considered a father figure, but the kid doesn't feel that's valid given the circumstances. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, they might feel that calling the stepdad \"Dad\" is inauthentic because there's no genuine relationship. The mom is upset, feeling ungrateful. But is the author wrong for not wanting to use the term? \n\nIt's important to recognize that family terms can be personal. If the stepdad hasn't earned the title through positive interactions, the author isn't obligated to use it. However, the mom's reaction might stem from wanting the stepdad to be accepted. But if the stepdad isn't meeting expectations, the author's resistance is understandable. \n\nThe key points are the lack of effort from the stepdad and the strained relationship. The author isn't being disrespectful, just factual. The mom's anger seems misplaced because the author is expressing their feelings honestly. So, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
