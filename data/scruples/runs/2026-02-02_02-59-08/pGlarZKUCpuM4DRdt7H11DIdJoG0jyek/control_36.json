In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

The stepfather isn't close with the kid, they argue a lot, and he's not nice. The mom calls him \"your father,\" and the kid says, \"he's not my dad,\" leading to a conflict.\n\nI need to consider the dynamics here. The kid's feelings are valid if they don't feel a connection or respect towards the stepfather. The mother's reaction might be because she wants the child to accept the new husband as part of the family. But forcing a child to use a title that makes them uncomfortable can be problematic. \n\nIn many cases, children have the right to choose how they refer to stepparents, especially if the relationship is strained. The mother's anger might stem from wanting the child to integrate him into the family, but that shouldn't override the child's emotional needs. The stepfather's behavior (arguing, not getting to know the child) also plays a role here. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for expressing their feelings. The mother's reaction seems harsh given the context. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
