In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" The situation involves a stepfather who the author doesn't have a good relationship with\u2014there's arguing between him and the mom, and the author hasn't felt close to him. The mom called the stepfather \"your father,\" and the author responded with \"he's not my dad,\" leading to the mom being upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author's resistance to calling the stepfather \"Dad\" stems from their actual relationship. The stepfather hasn't made an effort to connect, and their interactions have been strained. Legally or socially, a stepfather isn't automatically considered a parent, but the mom might want to present him as such for family unity. However, the author's feelings are valid if there's no real connection. \n\nThe mom's reaction might be out of a desire for the author to accept the new family structure, but forcing a term of endearment that doesn't feel genuine can be invalidating. The author isn't wrong for not calling him \"Dad\" if they don't see him as a father figure. The mom's anger might be more about her own expectations than the author's right to set boundaries.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. They're expressing their genuine feelings about their stepfather. The mom's reaction is more about her expectations than the author's actions. The answer should be B (No).\n"
