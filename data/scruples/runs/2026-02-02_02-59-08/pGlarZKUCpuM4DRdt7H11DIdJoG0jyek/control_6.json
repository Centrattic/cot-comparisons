In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're the asshole for not calling their stepfather \"Dad.\" So, their parents are divorced, and their mom is remarried. The stepfather isn't really making an effort to connect, and they argue with the mom a lot. The user doesn't have a good relationship with the stepdad, there's been arguments between them, and he's not being nice. Then, when the mom uses the term \"your father,\" the user says \"he's not my dad,\" which made the mom angry.\n\nHmm, so the user is standing by their statement that the stepfather isn't their dad. The mom is upset that they don't accept him. The key points here: the user's relationship with the stepdad is strained, and the stepdad hasn't tried to build a connection. Also, the mom is pushing for the term \"father,\" which might be a source of conflict.\n\nI think the user isn't wrong here. They're being honest about how they feel. The stepdad isn't fulfilling the role of a father, so calling him \"Dad\" might feel inauthentic. The mom's reaction is a bit harsh, expecting the user to accept someone who hasn't earned that title. The user isn't being disrespectful by not using the term if they don't feel it. So the answer should be B, the user isn't in the wrong.\n"
