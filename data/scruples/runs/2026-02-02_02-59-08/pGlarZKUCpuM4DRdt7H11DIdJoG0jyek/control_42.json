  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not wanting to call my stepfather \"Dad\"?\nSo hear me out. In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about whether to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" The author's mom got divorced and remarried, and the stepdad isn't really trying to connect with the kid. They argue a lot, and the kid doesn't feel close to him. When the mom refers to the stepdad as \"your father,\" the kid says he's not their dad, which made the mom angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The stepdad isn't making an effort to build a relationship, which might make the kid feel reluctant to call him \"Dad.\" The mom wants the kid to accept the stepdad, but if the stepdad hasn't tried to connect, the kid's hesitation makes sense. The kid's response was factual and not angry, but the mom felt hurt and labeled the kid as ungrateful.\n\nI should think about the expectations in such situations. Sometimes, families expect stepchildren to adopt new titles, but it's not always appropriate if the relationship isn't there. The kid's right to feel uncomfortable if the stepdad hasn't earned that title. The mom might be projecting her own hopes for the relationship onto the child. The kid's response was straightforward, maybe not hurtful, but the mom's reaction is also valid in her perspective.\n\nSo, the question is whether the kid is wrong for not wanting to call the stepdad Dad. If the stepdad hasn't tried to bond and there's conflict, the kid isn't in the wrong. The answer would be B (No).\n"
