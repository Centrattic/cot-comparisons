In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if someone is in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" The situation is that the parents are divorced, the mom remarried, and the stepfather isn't really making an effort to connect. The stepdad and mom argue a lot, and the stepdad hasn't been nice. When the mom called him \"your father,\" the author said he's not their dad, which made the mom angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's reasoning is that the stepfather isn't acting like a father figure, so calling him \"Dad\" feels inauthentic. The mom, on the other hand, might feel that the author is rejecting the new family structure and being disrespectful. \n\nBut wait, family dynamics can be complex. The author isn't in the wrong for feeling that way. The stepfather isn't fulfilling the role of a father, so the author's reluctance makes sense. However, the mom's reaction might stem from feeling that her choice isn't being respected. But the author's statement was factual, not confrontational. They didn't attack the stepdad, just stated they don't see him as a father. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's more about the author's feelings and the stepfather's actions. The author isn't obligated to use a title if they don't feel it's appropriate. The mom might be in the wrong for getting angry over a factual statement. So the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
