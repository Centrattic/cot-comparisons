In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (AITA) is wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad\". The situation is that the parents divorced, the mom remarried, and the stepdad isn't very close to the kid. They argue a lot, and the kid doesn't get along with him. The mom called him \"your father\", and the kid responded that he's not, which upset the mom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The stepfather only became part of the family after the divorce. The kid lives with the mom, so the stepfather is a new parent figure. But the kid doesn't have a good relationship with him. The mom is upset because the kid refuses to call him \"Dad\", seeing it as not accepting him. \n\nFrom the kid's perspective, it's about identity and respect. If the stepfather isn't acting like a father figure\u2014doesn't try to connect, argues a lot\u2014it's hard to see why the kid would call him that. The mom is pushing for the term, which might be her way of trying to normalize the situation. But if the relationship isn't there, forcing the term could be invalidating the kid's feelings.\n\nThe mom's reaction is important too. She's angry and now not speaking to the kid because of this. That's a big deal. The kid didn't say it angrily, just a statement of fact. But the mom might feel the kid is being disrespectful or ungrateful for the new family setup. However, if the stepfather isn't fulfilling the role, the kid's reluctance is understandable.\n\nLegally, the stepfather isn't the biological father, so the term \"dad\" might not be accurate unless there's a legal adoption. But even legally, if not adopted, the title isn't required. Socially, though, families often use terms that reflect their relationships. If the stepfather isn't a father figure, using that term could be misleading.\n\nThe key points are the kid's feelings and the stepfather's behavior. If the stepfather isn't engaging, the kid's refusal to use \"Dad\" isn't unreasonable. The mom's frustration is valid in wanting the family to feel cohesive, but forcing a title that doesn't reflect reality might not be the right approach. The kid isn't in the wrong for expressing their truth about the relationship. The mom's anger seems disproportionate if the kid is just stating their feelings without malice.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The kid has valid reasons for not wanting to call the stepfather \"Dad\", especially given the lack of a positive relationship. The mom's reaction is more about her expectations not being met, but the kid isn't obligated to use a title that doesn't feel right.\n"
