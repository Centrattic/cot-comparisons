In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the stepfather not being called \"Dad\" because of a strained relationship.\n\nFirst, the author's mom is upset that they refuse to call the stepdad \"Dad.\" The author explains that the stepdad isn't trying to get to know them, they argue a lot, and the mom and stepdad have issues. The author said \"he's not my dad\" when the mom referred to him as such. The mom got angry, called the author ungrateful, and hasn't spoken to them since.\n\nSo, the key points here are the dynamics between the stepdad and the author, the mom's reaction, and whether the author was wrong to not call him \"Dad.\" \n\nIn many cases, people have different levels of comfort with family terms. If the stepdad isn't fulfilling the role of a father, the author might feel it's not appropriate to call him that. The mom might see the title as a way to integrate him into the family, but if the relationship isn't there, it's not fair to force the author to use that term. \n\nThe author's response was factual, not angry, so their intention wasn't malicious. The mom's anger could stem from feeling that the author isn't accepting her choice. However, the author has valid reasons for their stance. It's their right to choose how they address family members, especially if the relationship is strained. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong for not calling the stepdad \"Dad.\" The mom's reaction is harsh, given the context. So the answer should be B.\n"
