  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not wanting to call my stepfather \"Dad\"?\nSo hear me out. In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" The situation involves the parents divorcing, the mother remarrying, and the stepfather not really connecting with the child. The user says they're not close, there's arguing, and when the mom refers to him as \"father,\" the kid objects. The mom gets angry and hasn't spoken to them since.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the feelings of both parties. The kid has valid reasons: the stepdad isn't close, there's tension, and they argue. It's natural for the child to feel uncomfortable using a term like \"Dad\" if there's no real relationship. On the other hand, the mom might feel hurt because she wants the child to accept her new husband as part of the family. But the stepfather hasn't really made an effort to bond with the child, so the child's resistance is understandable.\n\nIn terms of social norms, people often use titles like \"Dad\" for step-parents, but it's not mandatory. It's a personal choice. The problem here might be that the mom is pressuring the child to use a term that doesn't feel right to them. The child's response was factual, not aggressive, so the mom's anger seems to stem from her own expectations being unmet rather than the child being disrespectful.\n\nI should also think about the dynamics. The stepfather wasn't involved in the child's life before the remarriage, so there's no inherent reason for the child to call him \"Dad.\" The child's discomfort is justified given their experiences. The mom's reaction might be more about her own feelings toward her new husband and wanting the family to present a united front, but that doesn't make the child's stance wrong.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the child isn't in the wrong. They're expressing their true feelings about a family member they haven't formed a close relationship with. The mother's anger seems misplaced, and the child's response was honest. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
