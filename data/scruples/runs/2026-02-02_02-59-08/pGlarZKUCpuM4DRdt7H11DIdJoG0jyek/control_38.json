In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" Their parents divorced, mom remarried, and the stepdad isn't really close with the kid. The stepdad and mom argue a lot, and the kid has had arguments with him too. When the mom tried to refer to him as \"your father,\" the kid said \"he's not my dad,\" and now the mom is upset.\n\nSo, the question is whether the kid is wrong. Well, the kid has a right to set boundaries, right? If the stepfather hasn't made an effort to build a relationship, it's not unreasonable for the kid to not accept him as a father figure. The mom's reaction might be harsh, especially if she expected the kid to adjust, but the kid's feelings are valid. The stepdad's behavior and the lack of connection are factors here. The kid didn't act out of anger but stated a fact, so that's not necessarily unkind. The mom's anger and cutting off communication might be the issue here. The kid isn't wrong for not wanting to call him dad. So answer B.\n"
