In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" The situation is that the parents are divorced, the mom remarried, and the stepdad isn't close with the kid. They argue a lot, and the mom called the stepdad \"your father,\" which upset the author. The mom got angry and hasn't spoken to the author since.\n\nSo, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know what I think. I need to decide if the answer is A or B. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the author's perspective: They don't have a good relationship with the stepfather, there's been conflict, and the stepdad hasn't tried to build a relationship. The author feels that calling him \"Dad\" is not right because they don't see him as a father figure. The mom's reaction was to call the author ungrateful and not accepting, which is causing a rift.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom might feel that the stepdad is now her husband, and the author should respect that by using the term \"father.\" She might feel that the author's refusal is disrespectful, especially since she's trying to present the stepdad as part of the family. The mom's anger could stem from feeling disrespected or not having her new family structure acknowledged.\n\nNow, considering family dynamics and emotional aspects. Children often have complex feelings about step-parents, especially when the biological parent is involved. The author's feelings might be valid if the stepdad hasn't earned that title through action and effort. However, the mom's perspective is also important; she's trying to integrate the stepdad into the family, and the author's response might have hurt her feelings or undermined her authority.\n\nLegally and culturally, a step-parent doesn't have the same automatic status as a biological parent, so the author isn't obligated to call them \"Dad.\" However, social norms and family expectations can vary. The key here is mutual respect. The author's statement wasn't angry, just a fact, but the mom's reaction is intense. It's possible that the author's honesty, while valid, wasn't communicated in a way that considered the mom's feelings. Alternatively, the mom might be overreacting, expecting the author to adopt a term without the relationship being established.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? It depends. If the author is being honest about their feelings without malice, but the mom is taking it personally, maybe not. However, the author could have handled the situation more diplomatically. But given that the stepdad isn't acting like a father and there's tension, the author's stance might be justified. The answer could lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the author isn't obligated to use a title that doesn't feel right. The mom's anger might be more about her own feelings than the author's wrongdoing.\n"
