In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The parents are divorced, and the mom remarried. The stepfather isn't really trying to get to know the kid, they argue a lot, and when they do interact, it's mostly arguments. The kid says the stepfather isn't nice. Then the mom calls him \"your father,\" and the kid responds that he's not the dad, which made the mom angry. She called the kid ungrateful and hasn't spoken to him since.\n\nSo the kid is upset because the stepfather doesn't meet their expectations of being a father figure. They don't have a good relationship. The mom is upset because the kid isn't accepting her husband as a father figure, hence the anger. The key here is whether the kid is obligated to call the stepfather \"Dad\" even if they don't have a good relationship.\n\nI think the kid's stance makes sense. If the stepfather isn't acting like a father and there's no bond or positive interaction, why should the kid use that term? The mom might feel rejected, but the kid's feelings are valid. The stepfather isn't performing the role of a father, so the term might not feel right. The mom's reaction seems harsh, but maybe she's feeling defensive about her new marriage. \n\nBut is the kid the asshole? The kid didn't say it angrily, just stated a fact. The mom might feel that by calling the stepfather \"father,\" the kid should accept him, but if the relationship isn't there, the kid isn't in the wrong for not using that term. So probably answer B, the kid isn't in the wrong.\n"
