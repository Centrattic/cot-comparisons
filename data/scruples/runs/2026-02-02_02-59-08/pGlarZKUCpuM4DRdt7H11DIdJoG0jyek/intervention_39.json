In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" The author's parents divorced, the mom remarried, and the stepdad is described as okay but distant and not making an effort to connect. The mom referred to him as \"your father,\" and the author responded that he's not their dad, which upset the mom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The stepfather and the author haven't had a close relationship. The stepfather hasn't tried to get to know the author, and they've had arguments. The mom is getting upset because the author doesn't want to call him dad. The author isn't in a place where they feel comfortable with that title, given the lack of positive interaction.\n\nFrom a family perspective, the mom might be pushing for the stepfather to be seen as a father figure, maybe to make the relationship easier or to integrate him into the family. But if the stepfather hasn't made an effort, the author's hesitation makes sense. The title \"Dad\" implies a certain level of closeness and acceptance that might not exist yet. The author's response was factual but might have been hurtful to the mom, thinking it's about ungratefulness.\n\nHowever, the mom's reaction of anger and not speaking to the author could be an overreaction. The author's statement was a matter of fact, not necessarily disrespectful. The stepfather's behavior and the mom's remarriage might have created tension. The author isn't obliged to use a title that doesn't feel right to them, especially if the relationship isn't there.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom's desire for the author to accept the stepfather could stem from her own need for the family to function harmoniously. But if the stepfather isn't making an effort, the author's refusal to call him \"Dad\" isn't entirely their fault. The responsibility isn't solely on the author to bridge the gap if the stepfather is also not engaging.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to call someone \"Dad\" if they haven't built that relationship. However, the way they responded might have been abrupt, contributing to the mom's hurt feelings. But given the context, the author's stance is understandable. The mom's expectation might be unrealistic given the current state of the relationship between the author and the stepfather.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer would likely be B (the author is not in the wrong). The author's refusal is based on genuine feelings and the lack of a father-son relationship, which isn't something they can force. The mom's reaction is more about her own expectations not being met, not necessarily the author being a jerk.\n"
