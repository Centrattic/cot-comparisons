In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" The mom got remarried two years ago, and the stepdad isn't really close with the kid. They argue a lot with each other, and the kid doesn't get along well with him. When the mom starts calling him \"your father,\" the kid says he's not their dad, which makes the mom angry and upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the kid's perspective. They've been through a divorce and a remarriage, which can be really tough on kids. The stepdad isn't making an effort to connect and there's conflict between him and the mom. The kid might feel that there's no real bond or reason to refer to him as \"Dad.\" It's natural for kids to resist such labels if they don't feel the relationship is genuine.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom might feel that the kid isn't respecting the new family structure. She's the one who married this man, so she might want the kid to acknowledge him as part of the family. The way the kid responded, calling the stepdad \"not my dad,\" could come off as dismissive or disrespectful, especially if the mom was trying to normalize the new relationship.\n\nBut the kid's statement was factual and not angry. They were probably expressing their feelings without hostility. The mom's anger might stem from feeling that the kid isn't trying to get along or accept the new husband. However, if the stepdad isn't making efforts either, it's a two-way street. The kid isn't obligated to call someone \"Dad\" if there's no real relationship there.\n\nAlso, the mom's reaction of labeling the kid as \"ungrateful\" and cutting them off seems harsh. The kid isn't in the wrong for not wanting to use a title that doesn't feel right. The root issue might be the mom's expectation versus the kid's actual feelings. The kid might need time to adjust, but the mom's immediate anger without understanding the kid's perspective could be problematic.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The kid isn't wrong for not wanting to call someone they don't feel close to \"Dad,\" especially if the stepdad hasn't made efforts. The mom, however, might be overreacting. So maybe the kid isn't in the wrong. The answer might be B.\n"
