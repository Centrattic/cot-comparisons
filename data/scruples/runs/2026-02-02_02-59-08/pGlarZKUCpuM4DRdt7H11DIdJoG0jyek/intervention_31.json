In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the user's mom remarried, and they live with her and her new husband. The problem is the user doesn't like the stepdad. They mention the stepfather hasn't tried to get to know them, there's a lot of arguing between him and the mom, and their interactions are tense. When the mom calls the stepfather \"your father,\" the user responds with \"he's not my dad,\" which made the mom angry, saying the user is ungrateful and hasn't accepted him.\n\nNow, the user is asking if they are the asshole (AITA) here. The user's initial thought is that they might be wrong, but they're seeking opinions. The answer options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong).\n\nI need to consider cultural norms and family dynamics. In many cultures, children are encouraged to refer to their stepparents with familial terms, like \"Dad\" or \"Mom,\" especially if they live together. However, that's not a universal rule. The user's resistance could be due to genuine discomfort or negative experiences. \n\nThe key points here: the stepfather hasn't made an effort to build a relationship, there's conflict in the household, and the user's refusal to use the term \"father\" is a response to their real experiences. The mom's anger might stem from her desire to present a united front or her own expectations about the stepfather's role. \n\nBut is the user wrong for not calling him \"Dad\"? If the stepfather hasn't earned that title through his actions, maybe the user isn't in the wrong. The user's stance is more about their feelings and experiences. However, the mom's reaction could also be a cultural or personal expectation. \n\nOn the other hand, the user's response was direct and might have been perceived as disrespectful, especially if the mom was trying to integrate the stepfather into the family structure. But the user's reasons are valid given the stepfather's behavior. \n\nSo, considering all that, the user isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have legitimate reasons for not using the term. The mom's anger is misplaced if the stepfather hasn't been a supportive figure. Therefore, the answer might be B.\n"
