In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not calling their stepfather \"Dad.\" The situation involves a divorce, remarriage, and family tensions.\n\nFirst, the kid's mom remarried two years ago. The stepfather isn't close to the kid, they argue a lot, and the kid feels he hasn't tried to build a relationship. The mom calls him \"your father,\" and the kid responds that he's not their dad, which upsets the mom.\n\nSo, is the kid wrong? Well, family dynamics can be complex. The stepfather isn't the biological father, so calling him \"Dad\" might feel forced. The kid has valid reasons: the stepfather hasn't made an effort, they argue, and the mom's pushing for this title. The mom's reaction is harsh\u2014calling the kid ungrateful. But the kid's stance is about authenticity and personal feelings. \n\nLegally, maybe the stepfather isn't the father, but socially, some families adopt titles. However, forcing a child to use a title they're uncomfortable with can be problematic. The kid's right to feel how they do. The mom might want the stepfather to feel like family, but the kid's not in a place to accept that yet. The stepfather's behavior (not trying to connect, arguing) doesn't help. \n\nSo, the kid isn't wrong for standing by their feelings. The mom's anger seems misplaced. Answer B.\n"
