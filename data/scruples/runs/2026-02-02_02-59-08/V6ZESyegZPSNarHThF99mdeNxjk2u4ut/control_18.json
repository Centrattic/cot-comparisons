I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple moved in together, and the girlfriend asked for shared passwords as a sign of trust. The guy gave her his password, expecting the same from her. However, she started looking through his things: found old porn in browser history, old Skype chats with an ex, some pictures on an old phone, and even went through his messages. He found this embarrassing and decided to change his passwords to regain privacy. She got upset because she felt he should trust her.\n\nSo, the main question is whether changing the passwords is wrong. Let's break down the key points. The guy gave her the password, but she used it to invade his privacy. He didn't like that she was prying into his past, which he considers irrelevant now. He's trying to set boundaries, which he feels is necessary for his comfort. The girlfriend is upset because she expects mutual trust, which in her view means sharing access.\n\nNow, considering consent and boundaries. The guy explicitly told her he didn't want her passwords because he trusted her, but he expected her to respect his privacy. However, he gave her his password, which he might have thought was for mutual trust. But when she used that access to look through his personal stuff without his consent, he felt it was overstepping. By changing the passwords, he's taking back control of his privacy, which he feels is necessary. \n\nIn relationships, trust and privacy are both important. While sharing passwords can be a sign of trust, it doesn't obligate one to allow unrestricted access. The girlfriend's actions crossed into invasion of privacy, which is a violation of mutual respect. The guy is asserting his right to privacy, which is reasonable. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If he changed the passwords to protect his privacy after she violated his trust by prying, then he's not wrong. He's setting boundaries. The girlfriend's expectation that he shouldn't have privacy is problematic. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, he is not in the wrong).\n"
