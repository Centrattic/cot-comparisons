I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. The situation involves moving in together and sharing passwords as a gesture of trust.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend wanted shared access, but the author was hesitant, only giving her the password initially because they felt there was nothing to hide. However, the girlfriend started going through his personal data, which made him uncomfortable. Now he's changing the passwords to regain privacy.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The girlfriend's perspective is that sharing passwords is a sign of trust, and the author's refusal might be seen as withholding trust. On the other hand, the author's actions of changing passwords could be seen as protecting their privacy, which is reasonable if they feel their privacy is being invaded.\n\nThe key points here are consent and mutual respect. The author initially gave the password, which allowed access. However, if the author feels that their privacy is being violated when the girlfriend accesses personal data without permission, then changing the passwords is a way to set boundaries. \n\nBut here's the catch: by initially giving the password, the author might have implied that access was okay. If the author didn't specify that it was a one-time access or that they expected it to be used only in case of emergency, then the girlfriend might not have realized that the author didn't want ongoing access. In that case, the author changing the password could be seen as breaking trust by not communicating clearly. \n\nAlternatively, if the author felt uncomfortable from the start and the password sharing was a mistake, then changing passwords is a way to correct that. The fact that the author is now taking steps to protect their privacy might be justified, especially if the girlfriend is prying into personal matters without consent.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the password was given with the understanding that it was for trust and transparency, then changing it without discussion might seem like a betrayal. But if the initial password sharing was a mistake and the author felt their privacy was being invaded, then changing passwords is a reasonable self-defense. The answer hinges on whether the initial password sharing was based on mutual understanding and if the author communicated their discomfort before changing the passwords. Since the author did say they didn't want to have her password and only gave it reluctantly, it might show that the initial agreement wasn't clear. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for setting boundaries after realizing the password sharing led to invasion of privacy. Hence, the answer is B.\n"
