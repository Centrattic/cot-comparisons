I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for changing their passwords so their girlfriend can't access their devices. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple moved in together. The girlfriend asked for shared passwords as a sign of trust. The guy initially agreed, giving her his password because he felt there was nothing to hide. But then she found some old stuff\u2014porn in browser history, old Skype chats with an ex, pictures from an old phone, and even went through his messages. He's now changing his passwords again to keep his privacy, and she's upset because she feels it's about trust.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. I need to consider both perspectives. \n\nOn one hand, sharing passwords can be a privacy issue. Even if there's nothing to hide, people might have personal data they don't want others to see. The guy's actions of changing passwords could be seen as reclaiming his privacy, especially after his ex-partner's data and past interactions were found. He might feel that his past shouldn't be something she can access just because they're in a relationship now.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend expects trust. In a relationship, especially a close one, some people might expect a level of openness. If the guy initially agreed to share passwords, changing them later without discussion could be seen as a betrayal of that trust. She might feel he's being dishonest or secretive now.\n\nBut wait, the key points here are that he gave her the password once, and she went through his stuff. He had the right to change his mind if he felt uncomfortable. Privacy is important in relationships. Just because they're in a relationship doesn't mean they have to share every aspect of their personal devices. The fact that she found those things and it made him embarrassed suggests that sharing passwords might not be necessary.\n\nAlso, the idea that she's checking his messages without him being around could be a red flag. Trust should be mutual, but respecting each other's privacy is also part of a healthy relationship. If she's prying into his past, maybe that's the real issue here.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If he explained his reasons and she's upset, maybe he's justified in wanting privacy. The fact that he's not hiding anything but just wants to keep certain things personal seems reasonable. Therefore, he's not in the wrong for changing the passwords to protect his privacy after she invaded it. Answer B.\n"
