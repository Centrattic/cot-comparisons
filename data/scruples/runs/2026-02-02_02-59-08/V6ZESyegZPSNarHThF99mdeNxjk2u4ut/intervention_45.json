I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for changing their passwords. The situation is about a girlfriend wanting to share passwords to show trust, but the author decided to change them after she went through his personal stuff.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend wanted shared passwords, and the author agreed to give her the password but later changed it. The reasons for changing the passwords were that she found old, irrelevant stuff like browser history, old messages, and she was going through his phone. The author feels the need for privacy, while the girlfriend argues that they should trust each other.\n\nNow, considering privacy in relationships. Even in committed relationships, people often expect some level of privacy. The fact that the author agreed to share the password initially but later changed it might be a point of contention. However, the girlfriend was accessing private information without consent, which is a red flag. The author's action could be seen as a boundary setting.\n\nBut then, the girlfriend had a legitimate expectation of trust, and the author's initial agreement to share the password might imply that he was okay with that level of transparency. Changing the password after agreeing could be seen as a betrayal of that trust. However, the author's actions were a response to the girlfriend invading his privacy, so it's a form of self-protection.\n\nThe key issue here is mutual respect for boundaries. The author has the right to his privacy, even in a relationship. If the girlfriend expected full access, that might be a dealbreaker. But the author's decision to change the password isn't necessarily wrong if he's asserting his boundaries. At the same time, the girlfriend's initial request for shared passwords might have set an expectation that the author didn't fully agree with from the start.\n\nIn AITA situations, it's often about balance. The author's actions were a response to the girlfriend's overstepping, so he's not necessarily in the wrong. He's reclaiming his right to privacy after feeling that his consent wasn't respected. The girlfriend's expectation of trust is valid, but trust shouldn't require full access to private information without consent. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries.\n"
