I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices.\n\nFirst, the situation: The couple moved in together. The girlfriend suggested sharing passwords as a sign of trust. The author initially agreed to give her the password but later changed it after she went through his personal data, which made him uncomfortable. Now, she's upset because he's taking away access, arguing that trust is important.\n\nSo, the key points here are trust and privacy. The girlfriend wanted shared access as a trust measure, but the author felt privacy was also important. The author's actions were to protect their own privacy, which is a reasonable concern. However, the initial act of sharing the password could be seen as a compromise, so changing it might be seen as breaking that trust. \n\nBut wait, the girlfriend went through his private information without permission. That's a breach of privacy. The author's response is to set boundaries after feeling those boundaries were violated. In relationships, mutual respect for privacy is crucial. The girlfriend's actions might be a red flag, indicating she doesn't respect his privacy. \n\nSo, the author is asserting their right to privacy after being invaded. The girlfriend's expectation of access might be too invasive. The author isn't hiding anything; they're protecting their past, which is personal. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They have a right to their privacy, and the girlfriend's actions were intrusive. The author is correcting that by setting boundaries, which is necessary for a healthy relationship.\n"
