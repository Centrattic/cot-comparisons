I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who changed their passwords is in the wrong.\n\nSo, the situation is that the girlfriend wanted to share passwords to show trust. The guy gave her his password because he thought there was nothing to hide. But then she went through his stuff\u2014found old stuff like porn in the browser history, old Skype chats, some photos. He felt this was embarrassing, even though he says the stuff doesn't matter anymore. Now he changed his passwords again to keep her from accessing his devices when he's not around. She's upset because she thinks they should trust each other.\n\nFirst, the key points here. The user is trying to maintain some privacy. He gives her the password, but she used it to go through his personal stuff. Even if he has nothing to hide, the fact that she's prying into his past without his consent is an issue. Privacy is important in relationships, especially when it comes to personal devices. The fact that she's accessing his messages and apps without his presence suggests a boundary was crossed.\n\nHe's changing passwords to regain that privacy. Is that wrong? Well, if she agreed to share passwords expecting mutual access, but he's now limiting that, does that break trust? But he made it clear he didn't want her password because he didn't need it. So maybe he's being consistent. The problem is she's using the shared password to invade his privacy, which isn't okay. So when he changes the passwords, he's protecting his own privacy, which is a reasonable action. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is probably based on her expectation of shared access, but if he's uncomfortable with her going through his stuff without his consent, then his actions are justified. Trust is important, but mutual respect for boundaries is equally important. So the author isn't in the wrong; he's setting a boundary to protect his privacy after she overstepped. Therefore, Answer B (No) is correct.\n"
