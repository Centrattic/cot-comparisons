I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who changed their passwords is in the wrong. So the scenario is that the girlfriend and the author moved in together, and she wanted to share passwords to demonstrate trust. The author agreed to give her his password, maybe assuming that she wouldn't go through his stuff. But then she found some things in his browser history, old messages, pictures, and he noticed she was looking through his phone messages when he wasn't around.\n\nHe changed the passwords to maintain some privacy, which made her upset. The question is whether he's at fault here. From what I understand, the key points are mutual trust and privacy. He didn't like her going through his private data, which is understandable because people have different comfort levels with sharing. Even if he feels there's nothing to hide, the act of someone else accessing his past conversations without permission could be a breach of privacy. \n\nThe girlfriend might feel that not sharing passwords now is a contradiction to his earlier agreement, but the author's initial sharing might have been under the assumption that she wouldn't snoop. Now that he's uncomfortable with her actions, it's reasonable for him to set boundaries. So the answer would be B (No), because he's taking a stand to protect his privacy after her behavior made him feel violated. However, I should check if there's any nuance I'm missing. For example, if the author gave her the password with the understanding that she could access everything, then changing it might be seen as a betrayal. But the user mentioned he gave her the password even though he wasn't interested in hers, implying that the sharing was one-sided or based on her wanting to show trust. Therefore, the author's decision to change passwords to reclaim his privacy isn't wrong. It's about establishing mutual respect for personal space.\n"
