I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. \n\nFirst, the situation: The couple moved in together, the girlfriend wanted shared passwords as a trust gesture. The author didn't care about her passwords but gave her his. However, she ended up finding things like porn, old conversations, and looked through his messages. The author now changed passwords to regain privacy, which upset her.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that he's entitled to privacy and doesn't want her snooping through old, irrelevant stuff. The girlfriend feels this breaks trust. So, the question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nI need to consider the balance between trust and personal privacy. In relationships, there's often an expectation of transparency, but everyone also has a right to some privacy. The author gave her access because he felt there was nothing to hide, but that led to her invading his privacy by looking into personal stuff. \n\nChanging passwords isn't inherently wrong. If someone is accessing information without consent, the other person has a right to set boundaries. The key here is that the author is protecting his own privacy from being invaded. The girlfriend's actions\u2014looking through messages and old files\u2014could be seen as a violation, even if she had the password. \n\nBut the author initiated sharing the password, which might imply consent. However, the context was about trust, not necessarily about ongoing access. The author might have misunderstood the implications of sharing passwords. Now, he's realizing that giving her access allows her to delve into personal information without his active consent each time. \n\nSo, the author is taking steps to correct that by changing passwords. This is a reasonable response to protect his privacy. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from feeling that the author is now breaking trust by changing passwords, but the author's action is to prevent further privacy breaches. \n\nIn relationships, mutual respect for each other's boundaries is crucial. The author set a boundary by changing passwords, which is valid if the other person is overstepping. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for protecting his privacy after experiencing unwanted intrusion.\n"
