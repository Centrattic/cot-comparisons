I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about changing passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. The author gave their password initially but then changed it after the girlfriend started looking through their personal data. The girlfriend is upset, saying they should trust each other.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author moved in with their girlfriend, and she wanted shared passwords as a sign of trust. The author was okay sharing but didn't want her password. They gave hers but then later changed it when they noticed she was going through their stuff. The author's reasons are about privacy and feeling uncomfortable about past, irrelevant information being seen. The girlfriend argues that trust is important and that there's no reason to have passwords.\n\nSo, the main issue here is privacy versus trust in a relationship. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, they might feel that their privacy is important, even in a relationship. Everyone has a right to some level of personal space. The fact that the girlfriend was going through their messages and old data without explicit consent could be seen as a breach of trust. The author changed the passwords to prevent further intrusion, which might be a reasonable step to protect their privacy. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's argument is about mutual trust and transparency. In a committed relationship, sharing passwords can be a way to show openness. The author's initial agreement to share passwords might have given her the impression that it was acceptable to access their devices. When they changed the passwords, it could be seen as a betrayal of that trust, making the girlfriend feel like the author isn't respecting the agreement.\n\nBut here's the nuance: the author might have felt that the initial password sharing was a one-time thing, and the ongoing access led to discomfort. The girlfriend's actions (looking through messages, finding old content) were invasive, and the author's response was to set boundaries. The question is whether changing passwords is an appropriate way to set that boundary. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, there's a growing understanding that even in relationships, individuals should have their privacy respected. However, some relationships do involve sharing access to devices, and that can be a mutual decision. The problem here is that the author didn't like the invasion of privacy that followed the initial sharing. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If we consider that the girlfriend was accessing without consent (beyond the initial password sharing, which might have been mutual but perhaps not with ongoing permissions), then the author is protecting their privacy. However, if the initial agreement was for ongoing access, then changing passwords could be seen as breaking trust. \n\nBut the key here is the girlfriend's behavior. She went through old messages, which the author found uncomfortable. The author changed passwords to prevent that, which is about setting boundaries. The girlfriend's expectation of trust doesn't override the right to privacy. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to protect their personal information from being accessed without consent, especially if the girlfriend was using the access to invade their privacy. \n\nSo the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
