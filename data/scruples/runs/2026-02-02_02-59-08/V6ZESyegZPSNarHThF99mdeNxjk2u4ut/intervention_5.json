I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author moved in with their girlfriend and had given her their password as a sign of trust. However, the girlfriend started looking through the author's old data and private messages. The author feels that their privacy is being invaded and decides to change the passwords. \n\nSo, the main issue here is about privacy versus trust. The author gave the password to show trust, but the girlfriend overstepped by going through personal stuff. The author is now taking back their privacy by changing the passwords, which the girlfriend is upset about, claiming it's about trust.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author might feel entitled to their privacy, especially in their own devices. The girlfriend might see it as a breach of trust when the author revokes access after giving it. But the key point is that the girlfriend was prying into things the author considered personal and outdated. \n\nIn relationships, boundaries are important. The author might have set a boundary by initially not wanting her to have access, but gave in. Then when the girlfriend crossed it, the author tried to reestablish boundaries. The problem arises when the author changes the passwords without discussing it, leading to conflict. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they changed their own passwords to protect their privacy. That seems reasonable. The girlfriend shouldn't be accessing private data without permission. The author's action is about reclaiming their privacy, which they have a right to. However, the way they did it\u2014without talking\u2014might be part of the problem. But the core issue is about respecting personal space. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong. They have the right to privacy, and if they feel uncomfortable with someone accessing their devices, changing passwords is a valid step. The girlfriend's actions were the initial overstep. So answer B.\n"
