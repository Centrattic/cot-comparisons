I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who changed their passwords is in the wrong. The situation is that the girlfriend and boyfriend moved in together, and the girlfriend wanted shared passwords as a sign of trust. The author gave her the password but later changed it when he noticed her going through his stuff. Now he's being accused of not trusting her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author might feel that even though he gave her the password initially, he has a right to privacy. He mentioned that the items she found (like old messages, pictures) aren't important anymore, but it's still personal. Privacy is a valid concern. On the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that changing the password after agreeing to share is a betrayal of trust. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Trust is important in relationships, but so is personal privacy. The author gave her the password, which was a gesture of trust. However, if he felt uncomfortable with her accessing his personal data, even without malicious intent, then changing the password could be seen as a way to set boundaries. The key here is mutual understanding. If the author communicated his discomfort and still felt his privacy was invaded, he has a right to adjust his actions. \n\nBut the problem is that he didn't communicate that boundary until after she was already going through his stuff. Maybe he should have set those boundaries earlier. However, the fact that he explained his reasons (not wanting her to go through his personal history) shows he's not hiding anything malicious. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If the initial agreement was to share passwords, changing them later without discussion might seem like a breach. But if the terms were misunderstood or if he never actually agreed to have her access his personal data beyond just knowing the password, then he's justified. The answer might hinge on whether the original agreement was more about having access for emergencies or just knowing the password. \n\nIn many relationships, sharing passwords can be a tricky area. The author might have thought that giving her the password was sufficient trust, but he didn't expect her to go through his personal files. The girlfriend might feel that once the password is shared, she has the right to access everything. However, personal privacy is a common expectation, even in relationships. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He has the right to adjust his privacy settings if he feels uncomfortable. The issue is more about communication and mutual respect for boundaries. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because privacy is a valid concern and the author isn't hiding anything harmful. The girlfriend's actions might be overstepping, even if she's not malicious. The author's change of passwords is a reasonable step to protect his privacy after realizing that her access was causing discomfort.\n"
