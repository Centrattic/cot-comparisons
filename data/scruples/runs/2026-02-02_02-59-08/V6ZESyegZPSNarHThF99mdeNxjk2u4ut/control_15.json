I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for changing their passwords so their girlfriend can't access their devices. I need to decide between answer A (Yes) or B (No).\n\nFirst, the situation: The couple moved in together. The girlfriend wanted shared passwords to show trust. The author initially gave her the password, saying there's nothing to hide. But then the girlfriend found old porn, old Skype chats with an ex, and looked through his messages. The author now wants to change passwords for privacy, but the girlfriend is upset because they should trust each other.\n\nSo, the key points here are about privacy vs. trust. The author is trying to maintain some personal space, especially since the girlfriend has already invaded his privacy by looking through his stuff. The girlfriend is upset because she feels the passwords should be shared as a sign of trust.\n\nIn relationships, trust is important, but so is mutual respect for each other's privacy. The author isn't hiding anything new; the issues are old and irrelevant. The fact that the girlfriend is prying into past conversations and files without permission might indicate she's overstepping. The author changing passwords to reclaim privacy makes sense here. It's about setting boundaries, not necessarily about hiding something. The girlfriend's expectation to have access might be unreasonable if it's causing discomfort.\n\nHowever, the author did initially agree to share the password. By changing it, they're breaking that mutual agreement. But since the girlfriend was already violating privacy, maybe the author is justified in adjusting boundaries. It's a balance between trust and respecting each other's limits. The author isn't being secretive; they're just asserting their right to privacy in certain areas. So, the answer might be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because they have a right to privacy and the girlfriend's actions were intrusive.\n"
