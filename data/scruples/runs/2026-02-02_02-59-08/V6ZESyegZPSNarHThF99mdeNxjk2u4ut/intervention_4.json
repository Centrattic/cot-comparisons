I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) post is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. \n\nFirst, the situation: The girlfriend and boyfriend moved in together. The girlfriend wanted to share passwords as a show of trust. The author initially agreed to give her his password because he felt there was nothing to hide. However, the girlfriend found some things she didn't like (porn history, old conversations, etc.), and then he changed the passwords to regain privacy. Now she's upset, citing trust issues.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants another perspective. \n\nI need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is about privacy and feeling uncomfortable when his past was pried into. He might feel that even though he's open about sharing, the invasion of privacy crossed a line. On the other hand, the girlfriend wanted to share passwords as a sign of trust, so when he changed them, she might feel betrayed or like he's hiding something now.\n\nFrom a trust standpoint, if both agreed to share passwords, changing them could be seen as breaking that agreement. However, the author might argue that the initial agreement was based on mutual trust, but the execution (her prying into past issues) made him uncomfortable, so he's trying to set boundaries. \n\nPrivacy is also a key point. Even in a relationship, people have the right to some level of privacy. The girlfriend might not respect that boundary, leading to conflict. The author's actions could be seen as self-protective rather than deceitful, especially if he's not hiding current activities but just wants to keep past stuff private.\n\nBut then, if the agreement was mutual and he went back on it without discussing, that could be seen as a breach of trust. However, the context is that his privacy was invaded, so changing the passwords might be a reasonable response to protect his personal space.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a balance between mutual trust and individual privacy. If the author communicated his discomfort early on, he might have a stronger case. But since he initially agreed and then changed his mind without addressing it with her, she might feel he's being inconsistent. However, the fact that she was prying into things he found embarrassing might justify his need for privacy. \n\nI think the key here is whether the author should have communicated his boundaries earlier. If he had set clear limits about not wanting her to go through his old devices or messages, maybe the situation could have been avoided. But since he did change the passwords after the fact, it's a bit of a gray area. \n\nIn many relationships, some level of privacy is expected even when sharing passwords. The girlfriend might have overstepped by going through his old messages and pictures without his consent, which the author found embarrassing. Therefore, the author's action to change passwords could be a way to reclaim that privacy. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he's asserting his right to privacy after a breach. However, some might argue A if they think mutual agreement on sharing passwords should be honored. But considering the invasion of his past, the author is protecting his personal space, which is reasonable. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
