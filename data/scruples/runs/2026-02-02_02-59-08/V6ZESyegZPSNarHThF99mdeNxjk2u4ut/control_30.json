I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who changed their passwords after their girlfriend looked through their personal stuff is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the situation: the couple moved in together, and the girlfriend wanted to share passwords as a sign of trust. The author initially gave her the password because they thought there was nothing to hide. But then the girlfriend found old browser history, Skype messages with an ex, pictures on an old phone, and even looked through their phone messages. The author finds this embarrassing and decides to change passwords to maintain privacy, which upsets the girlfriend.\n\nSo, the main question here is about privacy versus trust. The author is trying to protect their personal information after their partner invaded their privacy without permission. The girlfriend's argument is that they should trust each other, but trust can be a two-way street. If one person respects the other's privacy, that's part of mutual trust. The author isn't hiding anything new; they're just reclaiming their right to privacy after the initial breach. \n\nAlso, the things the girlfriend found were from the past and not necessarily relevant anymore. The author might feel that their personal space is being overstepped, especially if the girlfriend is looking through messages without being asked. Changing passwords to prevent unauthorized access isn't necessarily a lack of trust; it's about setting boundaries. \n\nIn relationships, it's important for both partners to have clear boundaries. If the author hasn't communicated their discomfort with her accessing their devices before, maybe there's a communication issue. However, the fact that the author is now changing passwords suggests they want to establish those boundaries now, especially since the partner is already overstepping. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. They have the right to privacy, and if the girlfriend is accessing their stuff without permission, the author is justified in taking steps to prevent that. The girlfriend might be using the \"sharing passwords is trust\" argument, but that doesn't mean the author should allow her to invade their privacy. Healthy relationships require mutual respect for each other's boundaries. The answer is B.\n"
