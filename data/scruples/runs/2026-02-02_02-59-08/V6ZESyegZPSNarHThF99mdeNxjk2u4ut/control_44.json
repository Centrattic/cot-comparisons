I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for changing their passwords so their girlfriend can't access their devices. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple moved in together, and the girlfriend wanted to share passwords as a sign of trust. The author gave her their password, but then the girlfriend found some old stuff like porn history, old messages with an ex, and pictures. The author feels embarrassed and wants privacy, so they're changing passwords again. The girlfriend is upset, saying they should trust each other.\n\nNow, I have to decide if the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The main points are privacy vs. trust. In relationships, mutual respect is key. The author initially gave the password but set boundaries, saying they don't need her passwords. The girlfriend didn't respect those boundaries by snooping into messages. The author is now taking steps to protect their privacy, which is a reasonable response if they're uncomfortable with the intrusion.\n\nBut in relationships, transparency is often expected. However, everyone has a right to some privacy. The girlfriend's actions might be overstepping by going through private messages. The author's decision to change passwords is a way to maintain boundaries, which is important for personal space. The girlfriend's reaction suggests she might not respect his need for privacy, which could be a problem in the relationship.\n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have a right to privacy, especially if their boundaries are being ignored. The issue might be more about the girlfriend not respecting those boundaries rather than the author being wrong for protecting their privacy. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
