I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's analyze this situation step by step. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. \n\nFirst, the girlfriend wanted to share passwords as a gesture of trust. The author initially gave her the password but later decided to change it after the girlfriend went through his personal data. The author's reasoning is to maintain some privacy, while the girlfriend feels that mutual trust requires shared access.\n\nI need to consider the dynamics here. Trust is a key component in relationships, but so is individual privacy. The author isn't hiding anything malicious; the items found were old, irrelevant, or not secret. The girlfriend's actions of prying into the author's messages and apps, despite being given access, might be seen as an overstep. The author felt the need to set boundaries after experiencing invasion of privacy. \n\nIs it wrong to prioritize one's privacy? It depends on cultural and personal values. In some relationships, full transparency is expected, but others might value personal space. The author isn't being deceptive by changing passwords; they're reclaiming their privacy. The girlfriend's upset reaction might stem from a different expectation of trust. \n\nHowever, communication is crucial. The author could have discussed their discomfort earlier instead of waiting until after privacy breaches occurred. Still, the act of changing passwords to protect personal information isn't inherently wrong if both parties had differing views on privacy. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're asserting their need for privacy, which is a valid stance. The girlfriend's actions might be inconsiderate, but that doesn't make the author at fault for setting boundaries. Therefore, the answer would be B.\n"
