I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves changing passwords to prevent a girlfriend from accessing their devices. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The couple moved in together, and the girlfriend wanted to share passwords as a sign of trust. The author gave her his password but later changed it when he noticed she was going through his private stuff. He's now questioning if he's at fault.\n\nSo, the main points here are trust, privacy, and boundaries. The author gave his password initially, but the girlfriend used it to access his personal data. He feels his privacy is being invaded and decides to take back control by changing passwords. \n\nIn relationships, trust is important, but so is the right to personal privacy. The girlfriend might feel that not sharing passwords is a breach of trust, but the author is trying to protect his personal space. The key here is mutual respect for each other's boundaries. If the author is uncomfortable with his privacy being invaded, it's reasonable for him to set those boundaries. \n\nHowever, communication is crucial. The author should have discussed his concerns earlier instead of just changing the password. But since the girlfriend was already accessing his information without his consent, changing the passwords to protect his privacy is a reasonable response. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because he's asserting his right to privacy after his boundaries were violated. The girlfriend's actions were intrusive, and the author's response is about maintaining his own comfort and security in the relationship.\n"
