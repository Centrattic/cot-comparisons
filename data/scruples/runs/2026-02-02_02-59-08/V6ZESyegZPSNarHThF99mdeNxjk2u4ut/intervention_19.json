I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for changing their passwords after their girlfriend accessed their personal stuff.\n\nFirst, the context: The author moved in with their girlfriend. She wanted shared passwords as a sign of trust. The author was okay giving her the password because they had nothing to hide. But then the girlfriend found some things on the author's devices\u2014like browser history, old Skype messages, old photos, and even went through their messages when they weren't around. The author is now changing passwords to regain privacy, and the girlfriend is upset, saying it's about trust.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong for doing that. The user thinks the author is wrong but wants to know my take.\n\nLet me break this down. The key points here are privacy versus trust in a relationship. The author had initially agreed to share passwords, which the girlfriend saw as a gesture of trust. But the girlfriend's actions\u2014looking through messages without permission, accessing old devices, etc.\u2014might be a breach of the author's privacy. The author is now taking steps to protect their privacy, which the girlfriend is interpreting as a lack of trust.\n\nIn relationships, boundaries are important. Just because someone shares something doesn't mean the other person can access all their private data anytime. The girlfriend's actions seem invasive. The author's response is about setting personal boundaries. The author isn't hiding anything new or harmful; they're reclaiming their right to privacy. The girlfriend's expectation that the author should keep the passwords the same might be unreasonable, especially after her behavior.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for changing the passwords. They have the right to privacy even in a relationship. The girlfriend's actions were the issue here. The author's response is about maintaining personal boundaries, which is valid.\n"
