I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who changed their passwords is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend wanting access to the author's devices, and the author deciding to change passwords to maintain privacy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend wanted shared passwords as a sign of trust, and the author initially gave her the password. But then she went through his stuff, which made him uncomfortable. He changed the passwords to protect his privacy. \n\nThe key points here are trust and boundaries. The author might feel that their privacy is important, especially if they don't want past content to be an issue. On the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that changing passwords is a breach of trust after agreeing to share them.\n\nI should think about consent and mutual agreement. The author gave the password once, but the girlfriend's actions (going through messages, accessing old files) might have crossed a line. The author has the right to set boundaries, even in a relationship. However, the girlfriend might see the password change as a lack of trust. \n\nIn relationships, communication is crucial. The author could have discussed their discomfort earlier. But since the girlfriend was already accessing private information without consent, the author's decision to protect their privacy makes sense. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They had a legitimate reason to want privacy after the invasion of their personal data. Changing passwords is a reasonable step to prevent further intrusion. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
