I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple moved in together, and the girlfriend wanted to share passwords as a sign of trust. The author initially gave her the password but later changed them after the girlfriend snooped through his stuff, found old, irrelevant stuff, and he felt his privacy was invaded. Now he's changing the passwords again to maintain privacy, and the girlfriend is upset about it.\n\nThe key points here are consent and boundaries. The author gave her the password once but then changed it when he felt his privacy was being breached. The girlfriend, however, felt that trust was broken. The author's action is about setting boundaries for his own privacy, which is a personal right. On the other hand, the girlfriend expected trust, which she might feel was violated when he revoked access.\n\nBut the main issue here is that the author first gave her access, then changed it. The girlfriend might feel that by giving the password, there was an agreement to maintain transparency. However, the author had the right to withdraw his consent if he felt his privacy was being invaded. The fact that she went through his devices without his permission is a problem. In many relationships, mutual respect for each other's privacy is important. The author is trying to protect his personal space, which is reasonable. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for changing passwords to maintain his privacy, especially after his boundaries were crossed. The girlfriend's actions of snooping without permission are the root issue here. Therefore, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
