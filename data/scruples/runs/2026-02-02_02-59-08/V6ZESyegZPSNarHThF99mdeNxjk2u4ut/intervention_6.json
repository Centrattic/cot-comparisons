I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who changed their passwords is in the wrong. The situation is that the author and his girlfriend moved in together. She wanted to share passwords as a sign of trust, but he didn't want her password because he felt she didn't need it. However, he did give her his password because he had nothing to hide. \n\nThen, she found some things in his browser history, old messages, and even looked through his phone. He found this invading his privacy and decided to change his passwords. Now, she's upset and says this is a breach of trust. He's unsure if he's at fault.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong for changing his passwords. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, sharing passwords can be seen as a gesture of trust in a relationship. If he agreed to share his password, then changing it might break that trust. But on the other hand, he has the right to privacy. If she was going through his things without explicit permission, even if she had the password, that's a problem. He might feel that his privacy is being invaded, especially with old, irrelevant content that's now causing embarrassment.\n\nThe key points here are mutual respect and boundaries. The girlfriend might see password sharing as a given in a committed relationship, but the author might see it as an overstep. The fact that she was invading his privacy by looking through his phone and old messages without his knowledge could justify his need for more privacy. \n\nAlso, the author gave her the password initially because he thought there was nothing to hide, but when she started using it to invade his privacy, he changed the password. This could be a reasonable response to protect his personal space. \n\nIn relationships, trust and privacy can sometimes conflict. It's possible that both parties have valid feelings. The author might not be in the wrong if he's setting boundaries to protect his privacy, especially after experiencing her prying. However, how he communicated this might matter. If he didn't explain his reasons clearly, it could lead to misunderstandings. \n\nOn the flip side, the girlfriend might feel betrayed if she believed that sharing passwords was a mutual agreement for trust. But given that she was already invading his privacy, he's justified in wanting to set boundaries. \n\nSo considering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He's asserting his right to privacy after experiencing her intrusion. The answer might be B (not in the wrong). But I need to make sure I'm not missing something. The act of changing passwords after giving access could be seen as breaking trust, but the context of invasion of privacy might make it understandable. So I think B is the right choice here.\n"
