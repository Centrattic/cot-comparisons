I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for changing their passwords so their girlfriend can't access their phone and computer. They moved in together, and the girlfriend wanted shared passwords to show trust. The guy gave her his password, but then she found some stuff like old browser history, messages with an ex, and went through his messages. He feels embarrassed and wants privacy, so he's changing the passwords again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider privacy versus trust. In a relationship, trust is important, but so is personal privacy. The girlfriend is expecting access to his devices, which he initially gave but now doesn't want to anymore. He's not hiding anything malicious, just old, irrelevant stuff that's making him uncomfortable. \n\nThe key points here: He gave her the password willingly, which he thought was okay. But her snooping through his messages and past data makes him feel like he needs boundaries. Changing passwords is a way to set those boundaries. \n\nIs it wrong to do that? Well, mutual trust is crucial, but it shouldn't require giving up all privacy. If she's going through his stuff without his consent when he's not around, that's a problem. He has the right to set boundaries around his personal devices and data. So changing the passwords isn't about hiding something new but protecting old, non-relevant information and maintaining his personal space. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. It's about balancing trust with individual privacy. The girlfriend's actions might be overstepping, so his response is reasonable.\n"
