I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a girlfriend and boyfriend moving in together, sharing passwords, and then the guy changing his passwords back after his girlfriend started going through his stuff. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend initially asked to share passwords as a sign of trust. The guy gave her his password but made it clear he didn't want hers. She then found various things on his devices, like old messages, photos, and browser history. He changed his passwords to regain privacy, leading to an argument about trust.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. From a relationship standpoint, trust is crucial. The girlfriend's argument is that sharing passwords shows trust, and the guy changing them might seem like a breach of that trust. But on the other hand, everyone has a right to privacy. The guy is within his rights to set boundaries, especially if he feels uncomfortable with her accessing his personal data without consent.\n\nHe mentioned that he didn't mind her finding the stuff but found it embarrassing. That's a valid feeling. Privacy is about personal space and boundaries. The girlfriend's actions of going through his messages without his knowledge could be considered invasive. So, the guy changing the passwords to prevent further intrusion is a reasonable response.\n\nBut there's a balance. Trust and communication are key. The guy should have discussed his discomfort with her actions before changing the passwords, maybe leading to a mutual understanding. However, since she was already invading his privacy, his action to protect his privacy isn't necessarily wrong.\n\nIn many relationships, partners might agree on certain levels of transparency, but that doesn't mean one shouldn't have personal privacy. So, the guy isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. The answer would be B, No.\n"
