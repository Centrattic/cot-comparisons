I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who changed their passwords is in the wrong. The situation is about privacy in a relationship.\n\nSo, the guy and his girlfriend moved in together. She wanted shared passwords as a sign of trust. He gave her his password but didn't want hers. Then she found some old stuff on his devices, like browser history, old messages, and pictures. He's uncomfortable with her going through his stuff and changed his passwords. She's upset because she feels it's about trust.\n\nHmm. Privacy vs. trust. The guy wants to keep some privacy, which is reasonable. Even in a relationship, people have different boundaries. The girlfriend, on the other hand, might feel that not sharing passwords is a breach of trust. But he's not hiding anything; he's just setting boundaries. The things she found are from the past and not relevant now. He's not doing anything wrong by wanting privacy. Maybe the issue is communication. He should explain why he needs privacy without her feeling it's a rejection of trust. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nI think he's not in the wrong. Everyone has a right to privacy. Changing passwords to prevent someone from accessing your personal devices without permission is a reasonable step. The problem might be that the girlfriend isn't respecting those boundaries. So the answer would be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
