I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who posted the AITA (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong. The situation is about changing passwords to keep a girlfriend from accessing their computer and phone after she's been going through their stuff. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend wanted shared passwords as a sign of trust. The author initially gave her the password but later changed it after she snooped through his private data. The key points here are privacy, trust, and mutual respect in a relationship.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they want to maintain some privacy, especially regarding old, irrelevant content. The girlfriend feels that trust should mean openness, so she's upset when the passwords are changed. \n\nNow, in many relationships, sharing passwords isn't necessary unless there's a specific reason. The girlfriend's actions\u2014like looking through old messages and private files\u2014suggest she might not respect the author's boundaries. The author is trying to set a boundary by changing passwords, which is a reasonable step to protect their privacy. \n\nBut then there's the aspect of mutual trust. The girlfriend might feel that the password change is a sign of distrust. However, if someone is already invading your privacy, changing passwords to prevent further intrusion is a self-protective measure. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they have the right to privacy, especially in a shared living space. The girlfriend might need to reflect on why she feels the need to look through private information. The answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
