I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who changed their passwords after their girlfriend accessed their personal data is in the wrong. The situation is about privacy versus trust in a relationship.\n\nFirst, the author allowed the girlfriend to have their password for transparency but later changed it when the girlfriend went through their personal stuff. The girlfriend argues that trust should mean no secrets, while the author wants privacy.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, sharing passwords can be a way to build trust, and the author did share initially. But when the girlfriend started prying into private matters, that's where the issue arises. The author has a right to privacy, especially regarding old conversations and personal files that aren't relevant now. Changing the passwords is a way to protect that privacy, even if it upsets the girlfriend.\n\nBut the girlfriend might feel betrayed if the passwords were shared with the understanding of mutual trust. Maybe there's a communication problem here. The author might need to explain that while they trust her, they still need personal space. The key is whether the author's action was a reasonable response to protect their privacy after experiencing intrusion, despite the initial agreement to share passwords. \n\nIn relationships, boundaries are important. The author isn't hiding anything malicious; they just want to keep past personal stuff private. Changing passwords is a way to set that boundary. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're asserting their right to privacy without being deceptive. The issue is more about the girlfriend respecting those boundaries instead of accessing things without permission. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
