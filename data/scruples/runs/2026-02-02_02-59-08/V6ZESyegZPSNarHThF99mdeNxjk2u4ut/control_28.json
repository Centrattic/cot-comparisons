I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for changing their passwords. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe person and their girlfriend moved in together. She asked for access to their phone and computer to show trust. He gave her the password because he didn't mind, but he doesn't want her passwords. Then she found things like porn in his browser history, old Skype messages with an ex, pictures on an old phone, and she was going through his messages. He changed the passwords because he wanted privacy, even though he doesn't care about the stuff she found. She's upset because they should trust each other.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let me think about the key points here. Trust is important in relationships, but so is personal privacy. The girlfriend wanted access as a sign of trust, but the person feels their privacy is being invaded when she goes through their stuff. He changed the passwords to maintain that privacy. \n\nBut wait, he did give her the password initially. So maybe she thought she had permission to access his devices. Now he's changing the passwords without telling her, which she might see as a betrayal of trust. However, he's also within his rights to want privacy. The fact that she was going through his messages without his knowledge might be an issue too. \n\nIn some relationships, sharing passwords is part of being open, but it's also about mutual respect. If she was invading his privacy by checking his messages, then his changing the passwords could be a justified self-defense. On the other hand, if he gave her the password willingly, changing it without discussing it might come off as dishonest. \n\nBut the main issue is that she was going through his things when he didn't want her to. Even if he had given her the password, if he later felt uncomfortable, he can retract access. It's his device and his data. He's not doing anything illegal or immoral by setting boundaries. The problem might be in communication\u2014maybe he should have discussed his concerns before changing the passwords, but the act itself isn't wrong. \n\nSo considering all that, I think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). He's asserting his right to privacy after feeling that his trust was violated when she was checking his messages. The key is that mutual trust includes respecting each other's boundaries. If she wanted access, she should have respected his privacy boundaries too.\n"
