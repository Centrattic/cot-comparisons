I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who changed their passwords is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend who wanted shared access to their devices, and the author decided to change passwords after she went through his stuff, found old stuff, and it made him uncomfortable.\n\nHmm, the key points here are privacy versus trust. The author initially gave her the password but then changed it after she invaded his privacy. The girlfriend is upset because she believes they should trust each other. \n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, trust is important in a relationship. If you share passwords, maybe you should respect each other's boundaries. But on the other hand, everyone has a right to some privacy. The girlfriend going through his messages without consent might have crossed a line, which made the author uncomfortable. Changing passwords could be seen as reclaiming that privacy. \n\nThe author's actions were in response to her actions. He didn't want to hide anything but felt his privacy was being invaded. So, changing passwords isn't about hiding, but setting boundaries. That might be justified. \n\nBut some might argue that by initially giving the password, he implied trust, so changing it later is being inconsistent. However, the situation changed when she went through his stuff. He had the right to reassess. \n\nI think the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong. He's asserting his privacy after her actions made him uncomfortable. So the answer should be B.\n"
