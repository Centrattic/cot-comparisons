I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" situation is wrong for changing their passwords so their girlfriend can't access their devices. The author's girlfriend wanted shared passwords as a show of trust, and the author complied initially. But then the girlfriend found some old stuff, invaded the author's privacy, and now the author is changing passwords again.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about privacy and trust in a relationship. The author gave their password because they trust their partner, but the partner used that access to look through personal things. The author feels entitled to privacy and is changing passwords to protect their personal space. \n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, sharing passwords might be seen as a way to build trust. If you agree to share, maybe you should respect each other's privacy. On the other hand, everyone deserves some level of personal privacy. The author might feel uncomfortable with their past being poked into, even if there's nothing to hide.\n\nThe girlfriend might feel hurt that the author changed passwords, interpreting it as a lack of trust. But the author might see it as necessary to maintain boundaries. Is it wrong to set boundaries? Probably not. The initial agreement to share passwords doesn't mean both have to keep it open indefinitely, especially if one party is using that access to invade the other's privacy.\n\nSo, the author is trying to reclaim their privacy after the trust was breached. The girlfriend's actions, like checking messages without consent, are the real issue here. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for changing passwords. They're asserting their right to privacy after being invaded. Answer B makes sense here.\n"
