I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author and his girlfriend moved in together. She asked for shared passwords to show trust. He gave her his password, but then she went through his personal stuff, found old things like porn, old messages, and pictures. He's now changing his passwords to keep some privacy, and she's upset, thinking they should trust each other.\n\nSo, the author is trying to balance trust and personal privacy. The girlfriend wants transparency, but the author feels his privacy is being invaded. The key points here are consent and boundaries. The author gave his password with the understanding that there's mutual trust, but the girlfriend used it to go through his private data without his consent. \n\nIn many relationships, sharing passwords can be a sensitive issue. While some couples do share passwords as a sign of trust, it doesn't mean one person should have unrestricted access to another's private information without permission. Each person has the right to privacy, even in a relationship. \n\nThe author's action of changing passwords is a way to reclaim that privacy, especially after his boundaries were crossed. The girlfriend's behavior\u2014going through messages and apps without consent\u2014might be the real issue here. The author isn't doing anything wrong by setting those boundaries. \n\nHowever, communication is key. The author should explain why he's changing the passwords and why privacy matters to him. But the act of changing passwords itself isn't in the wrong. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
