I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The girlfriend wanted shared passwords as a trust gesture. The author agreed to give her the password but later changed it when they felt their privacy was invaded. The girlfriend is upset because she thinks they should trust each other, but the author is uncomfortable with their past private data being accessed.\n\nSo, the key points here are privacy vs. trust. The girlfriend is using the shared password as a way to access the author's devices, which the author now wants to stop. The author changed the password to reclaim privacy, which the girlfriend is upset about.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and relationships, trust is important, but so is personal privacy. When someone shares a password, they might expect that the other person would respect their boundaries. However, if the other person uses that access to snoop through private data, it's a breach of trust.\n\nThe author's actions were to protect their privacy after feeling that their boundaries were crossed. This is a common issue in relationships where the balance between trust and privacy isn't clear. The fact that the author didn't hide anything but still felt the need to change the password suggests that the problem was more about the invasion of privacy rather than something to hide.\n\nIn terms of being \"in the wrong,\" it's about whether the author had a valid reason to change the password. Since the girlfriend was accessing private information without the author's consent, the author is justified in taking steps to prevent that. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
