I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author in the given situation is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. The user themselves think the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the scenario. The author moved in with their girlfriend, and she wanted to share passwords as a sign of trust. The author was okay with sharing their password but didn't reciprocate because they didn't see a need. However, the girlfriend ended up going through his private stuff, making him uncomfortable. Now he changed the passwords to regain privacy.\n\nThe key points here are trust and boundaries. The girlfriend's actions\u2014going through his messages, looking at old conversations\u2014suggest that she didn't respect his privacy even after he set boundaries. The author changed the passwords to protect their personal space, which is a common reaction when someone feels their privacy is invaded.\n\nIn relationships, mutual respect is crucial. While sharing some aspects can show trust, it shouldn't come at the cost of losing personal boundaries. The author isn't hiding anything malicious; they're just asserting their right to privacy. The girlfriend's expectation that the author should not have passwords might be unreasonable, especially after her behavior.\n\nThe author's decision to change passwords is about maintaining self-respect and setting clear lines. It's not about keeping secrets but about having a personal space. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. The responsibility also lies with the girlfriend for overstepping without consent.\n"
