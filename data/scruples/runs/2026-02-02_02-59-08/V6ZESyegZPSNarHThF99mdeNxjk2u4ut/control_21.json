I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let's break down the situation.\n\nThe main issue is about changing passwords to a computer and phone to prevent the girlfriend from accessing them. The girlfriend wanted shared passwords as a sign of trust. The author agreed to give her the password but later changed it when the girlfriend accessed his private data, making him uncomfortable. The girlfriend is upset because they should trust each other.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend's perspective is that sharing passwords is a trust-building measure, and the author's action might be seen as breaking that trust. On the other hand, the author feels his privacy is violated when she goes through his past data, like old conversations and photos. He's not hiding anything but values his privacy, especially regarding old, irrelevant content.\n\nThe key points here are consent and boundaries. The author initially shared the password but changed it when his privacy was breached. He's not hiding something new but protecting old, non-sensitive information. The girlfriend's actions of sifting through his messages without explicit permission might be the real issue here. Trust is important, but it should also respect personal boundaries. The author's decision to change passwords could be seen as reclaiming his privacy, which is his right. So, he's not necessarily in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
