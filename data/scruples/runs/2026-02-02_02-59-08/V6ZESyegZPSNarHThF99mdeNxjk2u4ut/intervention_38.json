I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the given situation is in the wrong. The question is about changing passwords after the girlfriend accessed his personal data without permission.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The couple moved in together, and the girlfriend wanted to share passwords to show trust. The author initially agreed, giving her access, but then felt privacy was invaded when she found old stuff like browser history, Skype conversations, and looked through his messages. Now he's changing passwords again to regain privacy, and the girlfriend is upset about it.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but is curious. I have to decide if AITA (Am I the Asshole) it is for him. Let's break it down. The main issue here is the conflict between trust and privacy. The author gave his passwords voluntarily, which the girlfriend used to access his devices. But the author now feels that this access is intrusive, leading him to change the passwords.\n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial, but so is personal privacy. The girlfriend's actions might be seen as overstepping if she accessed his devices without his current consent. The author had agreed to share passwords but later realized that this access led to uncomfortable situations. By changing the passwords, he's trying to reestablish boundaries. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend's perspective is that trust should mean both sides are open. The problem is that the author might have given her the password under the assumption that it was a one-time thing, not expecting ongoing access to his personal data. Also, the fact that she went through his messages when he wasn't around could be a breach of trust from his side. \n\nBut the author's initial agreement to share the password could be seen as consent. If he changes it now without discussing, he might be breaking that trust by withdrawing access. However, if the access led to privacy issues, maybe the initial consent was given under different circumstances. \n\nI think the key here is mutual understanding and communication. The author should have discussed his concerns when he noticed her accessing his things. Changing passwords without conversation might seem abrupt. But the girlfriend shouldn't be going through his personal data without permission. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because privacy is important, especially if the access is causing discomfort. But his approach could have been better. The answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's setting boundaries after a breach of privacy.\n"
