I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who changed their passwords is in the wrong. The situation involves a girlfriend and boyfriend moving in together, with the girlfriend wanting shared access to each other's devices. The author initially gave her the password but later changed it after she found old personal stuff and went through his messages.\n\nFirst, the key points here are privacy versus trust. The author feels that even though there's nothing to hide, the invasion of privacy is uncomfortable. The girlfriend argues that trust should mean no secrets. \n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. However, privacy is also a personal right. The author isn't hiding anything illegal or harmful; they're just protecting old, irrelevant personal data. The girlfriend's actions of searching through messages without consent might be the real issue here. \n\nChanging passwords to prevent unwanted access isn't inherently wrong. It's about setting boundaries. The author made it clear they were uncomfortable with her accessing their devices, and after she did so anyway, they took action. \n\nThe girlfriend's expectation of shared passwords might be a sign of her not respecting the author's boundaries. The author's response is a reasonable attempt to protect their privacy. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
