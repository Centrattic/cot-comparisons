I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent the girlfriend from accessing their devices. The author gave her the passwords initially but now wants to change them for privacy, especially after she found some old, possibly embarrassing content.\n\nHmm, so first, the author moved in with their girlfriend and she wanted to share passwords as a trust-building measure. The author didn't want her passwords because they didn't feel the need, but they gave her theirs, thinking there's nothing to hide. Then, the girlfriend accessed things like browser history, old Skype messages, and pictures of other girls from old devices. The author feels that their privacy is being invaded, even though they don't mind the content itself. They changed the passwords, and now the girlfriend is upset, saying they should trust each other.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong by choosing A or B. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but is curious for another opinion. \n\nWell, boundaries in relationships are important. The author gave their passwords as a gesture of trust, but the girlfriend's actions of going through the author's private data (even if it's old) could be seen as overstepping. The author might feel that by giving their passwords, they trusted her, but she's using that access to snoop. So changing the passwords is a way to set boundaries and protect personal privacy. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might interpret the password change as a lack of trust. But the author is making a point that just because they share a living space and have given access once, it doesn't mean their privacy is entirely waived. Everyone has a right to personal space and privacy, even in a relationship. The key issue here is mutual respect for boundaries. If the author feels uncomfortable with their private conversations and data being accessed, then changing the passwords is a reasonable step. \n\nSo the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for setting boundaries. The problem might be that the girlfriend isn't respecting those boundaries or the fact that the author wants some privacy. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
