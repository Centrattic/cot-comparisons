I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA question is in the wrong for changing their passwords so their girlfriend can't access their devices.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The couple moved in together, and the girlfriend wanted shared passwords as a sign of trust. The author initially gave her the password, saying there's nothing to hide. However, after the girlfriend found some personal stuff from the past, the author changed the passwords to maintain privacy. The girlfriend is upset because she feels this is a breach of trust.\n\nSo, the key points here are about trust and privacy. The author's actions are about protecting their personal space, while the girlfriend sees it as a lack of trust. The question is whether the author is wrong to prioritize their privacy over the girlfriend's expectations.\n\nIn relationships, privacy is important. Even though they live together, having separate personal spaces is common. The author isn't hiding anything malicious; they just don't want past, irrelevant content to be accessible. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from feeling excluded or not trusted, but the author's right to privacy isn't necessarily wrong.\n\nThe author isn't being deceptive by changing passwords. They're setting boundaries. The fact that they even gave the password initially shows they were willing to share, but after the invasion of privacy incidents, they're adjusting to protect their own space. The girlfriend's actions\u2014going through messages and apps without permission\u2014are the actual issue here. The author is reacting to that, which is a reasonable boundary.\n\nSo, considering that, the author isn't in the wrong. They're maintaining their privacy in a relationship where the other person is overstepping. The problem lies more with the girlfriend's behavior than the author's decision to set boundaries.\n"
