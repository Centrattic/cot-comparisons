I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a girlfriend who's moving in with her partner and wants to share passwords to their devices. The author gave her his passwords initially, saying there's nothing to hide. But then the girlfriend looked through his stuff, found old stuff like browser history, Skype messages, and private photos. The author feels embarrassed and decides to change his passwords to regain some privacy. The girlfriend is upset because she feels it's a breach of trust.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author might be justified in wanting privacy. Even if he's not hiding anything, the fact that his past actions were found and discussed could make him uncomfortable. Privacy is important in relationships, and just because two people are in love doesn't mean they should have full access to each other's devices without consent.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that sharing passwords is a sign of trust. She might perceive changing passwords as a lack of trust. But the problem here is that the girlfriend was going through his stuff without his consent. That's a red flag. The author isn't hiding anything new; he's trying to protect his past, which he might not want to be discussed. \n\nThe key point is whether changing passwords is a reasonable action. Since the girlfriend was invading his privacy without his permission, the author is just setting boundaries. He's not hiding secrets; he's asserting his right to private space. The girlfriend's actions were the initial breach, so the author's response seems justified. \n\nAlso, in many relationships, mutual respect for each other's privacy is important. Just because someone is in a relationship doesn't mean they should have unrestricted access to each other's personal devices. The author is taking a stand to protect his personal space, which is reasonable. \n\nSo, considering that, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong. He has the right to privacy, and the girlfriend's actions were the issue here.\n"
