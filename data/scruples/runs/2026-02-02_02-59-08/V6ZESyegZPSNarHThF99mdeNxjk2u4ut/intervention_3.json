I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for changing their passwords to keep their girlfriend from accessing their devices. The situation is about privacy versus trust in a relationship. \n\nFirst, the author mentions that their girlfriend has been going through their stuff, like old browser history, messages, and photos. The author changed the passwords to maintain some privacy. The girlfriend is upset, arguing that they should trust each other.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the girlfriend might feel hurt or distrustful if the author is keeping secrets. But on the other hand, everyone has a right to personal privacy, even in a relationship. The author isn't hiding anything nefarious; they're just setting boundaries around their past and personal data.\n\nThe key points here are mutual respect and boundaries. The author isn't denying information that's harmful or malicious; they're protecting old, irrelevant content. The girlfriend's actions of searching through the author's devices without consent might be the real issue here. The author's decision to change passwords is a reasonable way to prevent further invasion of privacy.\n\nSo, considering that the author isn't engaging in deceit but rather setting healthy boundaries, the answer would likely be that they're not in the wrong. However, communication is crucial here. The author should explain their reasons to the girlfriend, emphasizing the importance of privacy and mutual respect, rather than just changing passwords without discussion. But the act itself isn't inherently wrong.\n"
