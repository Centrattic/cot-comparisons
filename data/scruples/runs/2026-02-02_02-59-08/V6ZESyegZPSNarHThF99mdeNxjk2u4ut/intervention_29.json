I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. The author had initially given the password out of trust but later changed it after the girlfriend accessed personal files and messages. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend wanted shared access as a sign of trust, which the author initially agreed to. However, the girlfriend's actions\u2014looking through private data like browser history, old conversations, and messages\u2014might be seen as overstepping. The author felt the need to reclaim privacy by changing passwords, leading to conflict.\n\nIn relationships, boundaries and trust are crucial. The girlfriend's behavior could be perceived as intrusive, even if she claims she's just trying to show trust. The author's decision to change passwords might be a way to set boundaries, especially if they feel their privacy is being violated. Privacy is a reasonable expectation, even in a relationship. \n\nHowever, the author did initially agree to share the password, which implies a mutual understanding. If the girlfriend felt the need to access those areas, it might indicate her own discomfort with the information she found. The key here is whether the author's action of changing the password was a necessary boundary or a breach of the trust they had established.\n\nOn one hand, the author has the right to privacy. On the other, the girlfriend might feel betrayed because the passwords were given as a gesture of trust. The author's justification is about protecting past private interactions that are no longer relevant, which others might find trivial, but the intrusion still matters to the author.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the author isn't in the wrong. They're asserting their right to privacy after their boundaries were crossed. The girlfriend's actions were the initial issue, making the author's response a form of self-protection. So the correct answer would be B.\n"
