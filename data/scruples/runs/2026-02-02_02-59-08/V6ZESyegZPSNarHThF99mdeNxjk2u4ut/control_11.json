I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) scenario is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. The answer needs to be either A (yes, they're in the wrong) or B (no, they're not).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person moved in with their girlfriend, and she wanted to share passwords as a gesture of trust. He gave her his password, but she ended up going through his personal data\u2014porn history, old Skype chats with an ex, pictures from an old phone, and even looked through his messages. He's now changing the passwords to maintain privacy, which upset her. He's unsure if he's wrong for doing this.\n\nSo, the key points here are privacy, trust, and boundaries in a relationship. The girlfriend wanted shared access, but the user felt that his privacy was invaded once he gave her the password. He's not hiding anything, but he's uncomfortable with her going through his personal stuff. \n\nIn many relationships, sharing passwords can be a sensitive issue. While some couples do share access as a sign of trust, it's not a universal expectation. The user made it clear he didn't want her password, but he gave her his own. The problem arises when she uses that access to look into his personal history without his consent. That's a breach of trust, even if she had the password. \n\nThe user's decision to change his passwords is about reasserting his privacy. Just because he gave her the password once doesn't mean he has to keep it open if it's causing discomfort. Privacy is a mutual respect in relationships. If the girlfriend is going through his things without permission, that's a red flag. The user is setting a boundary here, which is reasonable. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that by changing the password, he's being secretive or lacking trust. But in reality, the user is responding to her actions, not just making a unilateral decision without cause. The initial expectation was mutual trust, but her actions crossed into privacy invasion. \n\nSo, the user isn't in the wrong for protecting his privacy after her actions. The answer should be B (No). He's justified in setting boundaries, especially since her behavior was intrusive. The issue here isn't about not trusting her, but about respecting his own right to privacy and not wanting his past to be pruriently examined. The problem lies more with the girlfriend's actions than the user's response to them.\n"
