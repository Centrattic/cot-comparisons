I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for changing their passwords to keep their ex-girlfriend from accessing their devices. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person and their girlfriend moved in together. The girlfriend wanted to share passwords as a sign of trust. The author gave her their password because they felt there was nothing to hide. However, the girlfriend found various things like porn history, old Skype chats, old photos, and even went through the author's messages when they weren't around. The author is now changing their passwords to regain some privacy, which upset the girlfriend who claims they should trust each other. The author is unsure if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the main issue here is about privacy versus trust in a relationship. The author gave their password but then felt their privacy was invaded. The girlfriend is upset because the author is withdrawing access, perceiving it as a lack of trust.\n\nI should consider both sides. From the author's perspective, they might feel that their personal space is being overstepped. Even if there's nothing to hide, the invasion into their past could be uncomfortable. The fact that the girlfriend went through messages when the author wasn't around might be a breach of trust, not the other way around. The author is trying to set boundaries to protect their privacy, which is a reasonable action. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's request for shared passwords is based on mutual trust. She might feel that sharing passwords is a normal sign of openness in a relationship. Her reaction to the author changing passwords could stem from feeling that the author isn't being fully transparent. However, it's important to note that the author's actions were in response to the girlfriend's intrusion into their personal data.\n\nIn many relationships, boundaries around privacy can vary. Some couples share everything, while others maintain separate spaces. The key here is that the author is setting boundaries to protect their own privacy after feeling their trust was violated. The girlfriend's initial actions (going through messages, accessing old data without a clear reason) might have been the first breach. The author's response is about reclaiming that privacy, which is a valid stance. \n\nThere's also the aspect of consent. When the author gave the password, it might have been with the expectation that certain information wouldn't be accessed, especially old data that's irrelevant now. The girlfriend's actions could be seen as overstepping, leading the author to adjust their approach to protect their personal space.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, while some might argue that sharing passwords is a sign of trust, others might agree that everyone has a right to personal privacy, even in a relationship. The author isn't hiding anything malicious; they're just separating their private information. The girlfriend's insistence on access without respecting the author's boundaries could be the issue here.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're responding to a situation where their privacy was invaded and are setting healthy boundaries. The girlfriend's reaction is also about trust, but the initial intrusion might have been the catalyst for the author's actions. Therefore, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
