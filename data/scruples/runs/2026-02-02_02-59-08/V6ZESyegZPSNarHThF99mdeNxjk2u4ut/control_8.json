I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA scenario is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend wanted shared passwords as a sign of trust. The author agreed to give her their password but didn't reciprocate. The girlfriend then went through the author's stuff, finding old, irrelevant personal data, which embarrassed the author. The author decided to change passwords to regain privacy, and the girlfriend is upset, arguing that trust requires transparency.\n\nNow, considering relationships and privacy. Trust is important, but so is mutual respect for boundaries. The author gave their password but didn't expect the other way around. The girlfriend's actions\u2014looking through old messages and apps\u2014might be seen as overstepping, even if the content is harmless. The author's request for privacy is reasonable. However, the girlfriend feels betrayed by changing passwords, interpreting it as a lack of trust.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? They set boundaries after the girlfriend invaded their privacy. It's a balance between trust and individual privacy. The author isn't hiding anything malicious; they just want their past data left alone. The girlfriend's insistence on full access might be unrealistic. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for seeking privacy. Answer B.\n"
