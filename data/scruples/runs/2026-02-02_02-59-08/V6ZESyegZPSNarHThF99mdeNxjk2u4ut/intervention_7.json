I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple moved in together, and the girlfriend wanted shared passwords as a sign of trust. The author initially gave her the password but then changed it after she went through his stuff, found old stuff like porn, ex messages, and saw her looking through his messages. He's changing passwords again to have privacy, but she's upset because she sees it as a breach of trust.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. Hmm. Well, the key points here are trust, privacy, and boundaries. The author gave the password once but then changed it. The girlfriend felt that trust was broken. On the other hand, the author is trying to protect past private stuff that he might not want her to see. The girlfriend's actions (looking through his phone, finding old things) could be seen as overstepping, even if there's nothing to hide. \n\nSo, the question is: Is it wrong for the author to prioritize his privacy by changing passwords, even if it makes the relationship tense? \n\nIn relationships, trust is important, but so is individual privacy. If the girlfriend is going through his devices without consent, that's a problem. The author might feel that his privacy is being invaded, and changing passwords is a way to set boundaries. However, the girlfriend might see this as a betrayal of trust since she expected shared access. \n\nThe user says they think the author is wrong, but maybe that's because they value trust more than privacy. But others might argue that privacy should be respected, and the girlfriend shouldn't be searching through his devices. \n\nI think the answer depends on cultural or personal values. Some might say the author is right to protect his privacy, while others see trust as paramount. However, the girlfriend's actions could be problematic too. But the author is changing passwords after she invaded his privacy. So maybe he's not in the wrong. \n\nAlternatively, if he agreed to share passwords at first, changing them might be seen as breaking that trust. But the context is that she kept looking into his stuff, which he found uncomfortable. So maybe he's justified in protecting his own boundaries. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong (B) because he's setting healthy boundaries after her privacy invasion. But I need to check if the initial agreement to share passwords matters. If he gave the password once, maybe he's allowed to change it, especially if she's overstepping. So the answer is B.\n"
