I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and their girlfriend moved in together. She asked for shared passwords as a sign of trust. The author initially gave her the password but later changed them after she went through his old data and messages. Now, she's upset because he's changed the passwords, and he's wondering if he's wrong for doing so.\n\nThe key points here are privacy and trust. The author felt that even though there's nothing to hide, the invasion of privacy was uncomfortable. He changed the passwords to maintain some personal space. The girlfriend, on the other hand, sees this as a lack of trust.\n\nIn relationships, trust is important, but so is individual privacy. Just because someone shares passwords doesn't mean they should have constant access to everything, especially old, irrelevant data. The author's actions might be about setting boundaries, which is reasonable. However, the girlfriend might feel betrayed if she thought sharing passwords was a mutual agreement.\n\nBut the author did mention that he had given her the password initially. Changing it later could be seen as breaking that trust. However, the context is that he felt his privacy was invaded. It's a balance between mutual respect and personal space.\n\nIn many cases, people have different expectations about privacy even in relationships. The fact that he changed the passwords after she went through his stuff suggests he's trying to protect his personal space, which is valid. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But there's a nuance here. The initial sharing of the password might have implied some level of access, but if that access crosses into private, old conversations, then the boundary is being overstepped.\n\nI think the author is justified in wanting privacy. The answer might be B (No). But I need to check if there's a cultural or social norm that would make changing passwords after sharing them wrong. Sometimes in relationships, sharing passwords is seen as a mutual agreement, so changing them could be seen as a betrayal. But in this case, the girlfriend was prying into things that were irrelevant and old. The author's right to privacy is important. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is probably B (No). The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries and protecting his privacy, especially after the girlfriend overstepped by going through his personal data.\n"
