I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for changing their passwords so their girlfriend can't access their devices. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The couple moved in together, and the girlfriend wanted shared passwords as a sign of trust. The author initially gave her the password, saying there's nothing to hide. But then the girlfriend started going through his stuff\u2014porn in browser history, old Skype chats with an ex, photos from an old phone, and checking his messages. The author feels embarrassed and wants privacy, so they change the passwords. The girlfriend is upset, saying they should trust each other.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, sharing passwords can be a way to show trust in a relationship. The author agreed to share, so changing the password might seem like breaking that trust. The girlfriend's actions might be intrusive, but the initial agreement was mutual. If the author felt uncomfortable later, maybe they should have set boundaries from the start.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has a right to privacy. The girlfriend accessed personal, old content that's irrelevant now. The author is not hiding anything bad, just past stuff that's not important. The intrusion into messages and apps without consent is a privacy violation. So, changing passwords to maintain privacy might be reasonable.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's behavior might be a red flag. If she's going through his devices without being asked, that's a problem. The author's reaction is about protecting their privacy after feeling violated. But did they have the right to share access in the first place if they didn't want it? Maybe not. Or maybe they did, but the girlfriend overstepped.\n\nIn relationships, trust is important, but so is mutual respect for boundaries. The author might have overstepped by giving access if they didn't want it later. But the girlfriend overstepped by invading privacy. The author changing passwords could be a necessary step to set boundaries.\n\nI think the key here is that the girlfriend is violating the author's privacy, even if they initially shared passwords. The author has a right to privacy, especially in personal devices. So changing passwords to prevent further intrusion is justified. The author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
