I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who changed their passwords is in the wrong. The situation is about a relationship where the girlfriend wants shared access to each other's devices as a trust thing. The author gave her the password but then the girlfriend went through his stuff, making him uncomfortable. Now he's changed the passwords, and she's upset because they should trust each other.\n\nHmm, so the main points here are about privacy versus trust in a relationship. The author initially agreed to share passwords, but then the girlfriend started going through his private data, which made him uncomfortable. He changed the passwords to regain some privacy. The question is whether he's wrong for doing that.\n\nI think privacy is important even in relationships. People have a right to their own space. The girlfriend might have thought that sharing passwords was normal, but invading someone's private data without permission isn't okay. The author's action to change passwords is a reasonable step to protect his privacy once he felt it was being violated. So the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
