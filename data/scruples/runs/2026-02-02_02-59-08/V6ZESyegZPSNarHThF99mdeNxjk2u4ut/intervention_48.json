I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author moved in with their girlfriend, who wanted shared passwords to show trust. The author initially gave their password but later changed them after the girlfriend accessed personal items like browser history, old conversations, and messages. The author now wants privacy, so they changed passwords, which made the girlfriend upset.\n\nThe key points here are about trust and privacy. The girlfriend felt entitled to access the author's devices since they shared passwords. The author, on the other hand, felt that their privacy was being invaded when the girlfriend looked through personal data. \n\nIn relationships, trust is important, but mutual respect for privacy is also crucial. The author might have given the password with the understanding that there was trust, but the girlfriend's actions breached that trust. The author is now reclaiming their privacy by changing passwords, which is a reasonable response if they feel uncomfortable with the access.\n\nHowever, communication is key. The author should have discussed their need for privacy earlier. The girlfriend might have felt that sharing passwords was part of the relationship's openness. The author's sudden password change without prior discussion could be seen as a lack of communication rather than being in the wrong. \n\nBut considering that the girlfriend was going through personal data without permission, the author has a valid reason to want boundaries. The author isn't hiding anything malicious; they just want to protect past data that's irrelevant now. \n\nSo, the author's action is about setting healthy boundaries. They aren't doing something wrong by changing passwords to maintain privacy. The girlfriend's expectation of access might be too invasive. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
