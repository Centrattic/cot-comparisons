I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who changed their passwords is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend wanting access to their devices, and the person feeling the need to set boundaries.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend asked for shared passwords as a sign of trust. The author initially gave her the password even though they weren't interested in hers, probably because they felt there was nothing to hide. But then the girlfriend started going through his stuff, which made him uncomfortable. He changed the passwords to protect his privacy, and she got upset about it.\n\nThe key points here are privacy and trust. The author is setting a boundary to maintain their personal space, which is reasonable. Everyone has the right to some level of privacy, even in a relationship. The girlfriend's actions of going through his messages and apps without consent are a breach of that privacy. The author isn't hiding anything harmful; it's old photos, browser history, etc., which are personal but not illegal or harmful. \n\nThe girlfriend's argument that trust should mean no passwords is a common but flawed perspective. Trust doesn't necessarily mean sharing all digital access, especially when one partner feels it's necessary for their privacy. The fact that the author tried to explain this and the girlfriend was upset suggests a communication issue. The author isn't doing anything wrong by protecting their own devices; it's about mutual respect for each other's boundaries.\n\nSo, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They're asserting their right to privacy without engaging in harmful behavior.\n"
