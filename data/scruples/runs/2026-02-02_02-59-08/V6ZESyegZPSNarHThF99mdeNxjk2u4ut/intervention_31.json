I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author and their girlfriend moved in together. The girlfriend wanted to share passwords as a sign of trust. The author was okay with giving her the password but didn't want her passwords in return because they felt there was no need. However, after sharing the password, the girlfriend went through the author's browser history, old Skype conversations, pictures on an old phone, and checked their messages. The author found this behavior intrusive and embarrassing, even though they don't mind the content being found. They decided to change their passwords to regain some privacy, which upset the girlfriend who argued that they should trust each other.\n\nNow, the author is questioning if they're in the wrong. The user thinks the author might be wrong but wants my opinion. Let me consider the key points here.\n\nFirst, trust is a big part of relationships, but so is mutual respect for privacy. The girlfriend wanted shared access as a gesture of trust, which the author gave. However, the girlfriend's use of that access to look through personal items might be the real issue here. The author feels their privacy is being invaded, which is why they changed the passwords. \n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong to do that. On one hand, sharing passwords can be seen as a breach of privacy if one party is using the access to snoop. On the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that not sharing passwords after agreeing to it is a betrayal of trust. But the core issue seems to be about consent and boundaries. The author gave the password with the understanding that it's for mutual trust, but the girlfriend exceeded that by actively searching through personal items. The author's response is to reclaim their privacy by changing passwords, which is their right if they feel uncomfortable. However, the girlfriend's actions might stem from insecurity or a desire for closeness, which isn't necessarily her fault. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author should have addressed the invasion of privacy earlier instead of letting it build up. But changing passwords is a reasonable step if the boundaries were crossed. The girlfriend's reaction might be valid if she feels the author is hiding things, but the author's need for privacy isn't unreasonable either. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong because they're setting boundaries to protect their privacy after experiencing intrusion. The real issue might be the girlfriend's actions, not the author's decision to change passwords.\n"
