I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for changing their passwords so their girlfriend can't access their devices. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple moved in together, and the girlfriend wanted shared passwords as a sign of trust. The author initially gave her the password because he felt there was nothing to hide. However, after that, she found some old, personal items like porn in the browser history, old messages with an ex, and even went through his phone messages. The author then decided to change the passwords to regain some privacy, which upset the girlfriend.\n\nNow, the key points here are about privacy and trust in a relationship. The author's actions come from a place of wanting to maintain personal boundaries, which is common. The girlfriend, on the other hand, feels that sharing passwords is a way to show trust. \n\nI should consider both sides. The author isn't hiding anything new; he's protecting old data that's no longer relevant. His actions are about privacy, not secrecy. The girlfriend's concern is about trust, but she's invading his privacy by accessing his devices without permission. \n\nIn relationships, mutual respect and communication are important. The author's decision to set boundaries by changing passwords isn't inherently wrong. Everyone has a right to some level of privacy, even in a relationship. The girlfriend's actions of going through his personal items without consent might be the issue here. \n\nHowever, the author did give the password initially, which might have set an expectation of access. But if that expectation leads to privacy violations, then adjusting the situation by changing passwords is a reasonable response. The author isn't hiding anything new; he's just protecting his personal space. \n\nSo, I think the author isn't in the wrong. He's asserting his right to privacy after experiencing privacy breaches from his girlfriend. The problem might stem from the girlfriend not respecting his boundaries once they were set. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
