I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the person who changed their passwords is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe person moved in with their girlfriend. The girlfriend wanted shared passwords to show trust. The author gave her their password, saying there's nothing to hide. But then the girlfriend found some stuff like old browser history, Skype messages, old phone pictures, and even went through the author's messages. The author feels embarrassed and wants privacy, so they decide to change their passwords. The girlfriend is upset, saying they should trust each other. The author is unsure if they're at fault.\n\nHmm. So first, the concept of privacy in a relationship. Even in a committed relationship, people often expect some level of privacy. Sharing all passwords can be a big deal because it gives access to personal data. The author initially shared their password, which might have led the girlfriend to assume ongoing access. But when the author realized that the girlfriend was going through their stuff without permission, they felt the need to set boundaries.\n\nThe girlfriend's actions\u2014looking through messages, past conversations, etc.\u2014seem invasive. The author had the right to feel that their privacy was being violated, even if the content isn't harmful. The key point is consent. The author gave access once, but the girlfriend continued to access personal information without the author's permission after they expressed discomfort. \n\nChanging passwords is a way to reclaim privacy. The author isn't hiding anything harmful; they just want to keep certain personal things private. The girlfriend's expectation of trust shouldn't override the author's need for personal boundaries. Trust is mutual, but it also involves respecting each other's boundaries. If the author had given permission for shared access, then maybe, but since the access was used in a way that made the author uncomfortable, changing passwords is a reasonable step.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They're asserting their right to privacy. The girlfriend might need to reflect on why she felt the need to go through the author's stuff without consent. The answer should be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
