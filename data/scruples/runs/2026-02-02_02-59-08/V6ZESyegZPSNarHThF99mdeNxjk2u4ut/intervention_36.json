I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The couple moved in together, and the girlfriend wanted to share passwords to show trust. The author agreed and gave her the password but later changed it when the girlfriend found some old, personal stuff and started going through their messages. Now the author is changing the passwords again to maintain some privacy, and the girlfriend is upset because she feels this breaks trust.\n\nSo, the key points here are about trust and privacy. The author is trying to set boundaries to protect their privacy, but the girlfriend sees it as a breach of trust. The author has already shared the password once, then changed it after the girlfriend snooped. The girlfriend's actions\u2014looking through old Skype conversations, browser history, messages\u2014suggest that she's invading the author's privacy, which is making the author uncomfortable.\n\nI think the author has a right to privacy. Even in a relationship, people usually expect some level of personal space. The girlfriend is overstepping by going through private information, especially when the author didn't consent to it. The author is reclaiming that privacy by changing the passwords, which is a reasonable response. Trust is important, but it shouldn't mean one person can have unlimited access to the other's private data without permission. The girlfriend's reaction is about maintaining control or expecting transparency, which isn't healthy. The author isn't doing anything wrong by setting boundaries here. So, I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
