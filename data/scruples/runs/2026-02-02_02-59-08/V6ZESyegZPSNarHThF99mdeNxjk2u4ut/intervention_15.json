I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong for changing their passwords to block their girlfriend from accessing their devices. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The boyfriend and girlfriend moved in together, and the girlfriend wanted shared passwords as a sign of trust. The author initially gave her access, and now he's changing them back. The girlfriend feels hurt because she believes trust is important, and the author is upset about her going through his private stuff.\n\nSo, trust and privacy are both important in relationships. The author's concern is about privacy, especially since the girlfriend found old, irrelevant stuff and invaded his messages. On the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that not sharing passwords is a breach of trust. \n\nThe key points here are consent and mutual respect. The author didn't want to share passwords at first but gave in, which might have implied trust. Now, changing them again could be seen as breaking that trust. However, the author has the right to privacy. The girlfriend's actions (going through messages) might have justified the author's need to reclaim privacy. \n\nBut wait, the author initially agreed to share passwords, so changing them without discussing might be a problem. It's about setting boundaries. The author might have overstepped by not communicating better. Alternatively, the girlfriend's invasion of privacy was wrong, so the author is just protecting his own space. \n\nI think both sides have valid points. The author's action is a response to the girlfriend's behavior. If the girlfriend wasn't respecting his privacy, the author has a right to take steps to protect it. But the initial agreement to share passwords might have set an expectation. However, if that agreement was made under pressure or without mutual understanding, the author is within his rights to revoke access. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author should have discussed his discomfort with her going through his stuff instead of just changing passwords. But given that he did, it's a way to reassert privacy. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But if the girlfriend felt that sharing passwords was a mutual agreement for trust, then the author is breaking that trust by changing them. \n\nHmm. It's a bit of a toss-up. Depending on cultural or personal beliefs, some might see the author as in the right for privacy, others as in the wrong for not maintaining trust. But considering that the girlfriend was invading privacy, the author's action is a form of self-protection. So, answer B (author not in the wrong) makes sense.\n"
