I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend asked to share passwords as a sign of trust. The author initially gave her the password but later changed it after realizing the girlfriend was going through personal stuff. The girlfriend is upset because she feels the author isn't trusting her, while the author wants privacy.\n\nHmm, the key points here are trust and privacy. The author gave the password once but felt uncomfortable with the access after the girlfriend went through old messages and personal items. The boyfriend changed the passwords to protect his privacy. But the girlfriend argues that sharing passwords is about mutual trust.\n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. If the author agreed to share passwords as a gesture of trust, then changing them might seem like breaking that trust. However, the girlfriend's actions\u2014going through private messages and old files\u2014might justify the author's need for privacy. There's a balance between trust and the right to personal space.\n\nI think it's a gray area. The author might have overstepped if they agreed to share and then took it back, but the girlfriend's invasion of privacy could be the real issue. The author has a right to privacy but should have communicated better instead of suddenly changing passwords. Maybe a compromise was needed. But if the girlfriend was prying into things without consent, the author's action might be justified.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the original agreement was mutual sharing, then changing passwords without discussion could be seen as a betrayal. But if the girlfriend was disrespecting boundaries, then the author is protecting themselves. The answer depends on whether the initial password sharing was mutual or coerced. The author might be in the right if the girlfriend didn't respect the agreed privacy. But if the author agreed to share and then took it back, that's a problem. The situation is complex, but maybe the author isn't in the wrong because the girlfriend crossed boundaries. So I might lean towards B (not in the wrong).\n"
