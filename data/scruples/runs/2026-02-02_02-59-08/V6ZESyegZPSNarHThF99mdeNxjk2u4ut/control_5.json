I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who changed their passwords is in the wrong.\n\nThe situation is that the couple moved in together. The girlfriend wanted to share passwords to show trust. The author initially gave her the password but now changed them after the girlfriend went through his private stuff. The author feels the need for privacy and is changing the passwords again. The girlfriend is upset, arguing they should trust each other.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the concept of privacy in relationships. Even in committed relationships, people generally expect some level of personal privacy. The author isn't hiding anything malicious; he's just protecting old, irrelevant data that's causing embarrassment. The girlfriend, on the other hand, is going through his devices, which can be seen as an invasion of privacy. \n\nThe key points here are mutual respect. The author isn't keeping secrets that affect their relationship, like financial issues or infidelity. The content he's referring to (old messages, porn history) are personal but not relevant to their current relationship. The girlfriend's actions of snooping through his devices without consent are problematic. \n\nLegally and ethically, changing passwords to protect one's privacy is reasonable. The author isn't doing anything illegal or deceitful. The girlfriend's expectation of access without consent crosses a boundary. The author has the right to set boundaries regarding his personal devices and information.\n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong for asserting his need for privacy. The issue lies more with the girlfriend's actions of invading his privacy. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
