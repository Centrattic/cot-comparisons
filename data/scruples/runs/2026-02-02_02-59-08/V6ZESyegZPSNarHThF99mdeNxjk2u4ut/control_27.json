I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who changed their passwords is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend wanting shared access to each other's devices, but the author decided to change their passwords after she went through his stuff.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girlfriend wanted to share passwords as a sign of trust, but the author didn't want her passwords. He gave his, but then she found various things in his history and messages, which he found embarrassing. He changed the passwords to maintain privacy, and now she's upset.\n\nIs there a right or wrong here? Well, privacy is a personal issue. Even in a relationship, people have a right to their own privacy. The girlfriend might see shared access as trust, but the author feels that having his own privacy is necessary. He's not hiding anything malicious, just old stuff that's not relevant now.\n\nThe girlfriend went through his messages without his consent, which is a red flag. That invasion of privacy might justify the author wanting to set boundaries. Even if he gave her the password initially, he can change that if he feels it's necessary for his own comfort.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that the password change is a breach of trust. But if she respected boundaries, she wouldn't have gone through his stuff. The author is trying to protect his privacy after being invaded, which makes sense.\n\nSo in this case, the author isn't in the wrong. He's asserting his right to privacy after her actions crossed a line. The key here is mutual respect for each other's boundaries. If she wanted shared access, she should have respected his without going through his personal data. He's within his rights to protect his own space.\n"
