I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who changed their passwords is in the wrong. The situation is about privacy versus trust in a relationship.\n\nThe author allowed their girlfriend to have their password, trusting her. But then she went through his personal stuff, which made him uncomfortable. He changed his passwords to regain some privacy. Now she's upset because he didn't trust her enough to maintain access.\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. On one hand, sharing passwords is a personal choice. If he gave her the password initially, maybe she expected continued access. But on the other hand, privacy is important. He might feel that his personal data, even if from the past, shouldn't be accessible. The fact that she was going through his messages without asking could be a breach of his privacy. \n\nThe key points are mutual respect and boundaries. Trust is important, but so is personal space. The author might not be in the wrong if he's setting boundaries for his own privacy. However, maybe the initial agreement was mutual access, so changing it without discussion could be seen as breaking trust. But since she was invading his privacy by going through his stuff, his action is a form of self-defense. \n\nHmm. Maybe the author is justified in wanting privacy, especially if he feels uncomfortable. The fact that she found things from the past doesn't negate his right to privacy. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), because he's asserting his boundaries after a breach.\n"
