I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who changed their passwords is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend who wanted shared access to their devices, and the person decided to change passwords to maintain privacy after their girlfriend went through their stuff.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend wants trust and transparency by sharing passwords. The author gave her the password initially because they had nothing to hide. However, the girlfriend ended up going through old messages, browser history, etc., which made the author uncomfortable. The author then changed the passwords to regain privacy.\n\nIs privacy a reasonable expectation even in a relationship? People might have different views. Some might say that if you give someone your password, you should accept that they can see your past. Others might argue that past data, especially if it's not relevant now, is personal and shouldn't be pried into without permission. The author's actions are about setting boundaries to protect their privacy after the fact. \n\nThe girlfriend's perspective is about trust and openness. She might feel hurt that the author is now blocking her access, interpreting it as a lack of trust. But the author's reason is to protect their privacy from being invaded, not to hide something. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. However, the key point is that the author is trying to set boundaries after their privacy was compromised. They didn't hide anything new but just wanted to prevent further intrusion into their personal history. Since the author had the right to privacy in the first place, changing passwords to protect that privacy seems justified. So the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
