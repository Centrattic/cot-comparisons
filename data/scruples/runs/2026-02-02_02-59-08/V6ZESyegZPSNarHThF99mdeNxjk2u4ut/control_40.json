I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who changed their passwords is in the wrong. The situation is about privacy versus trust in a relationship.\n\nThe boyfriend allowed his girlfriend to have his password but later changed it because he felt his privacy was being invaded. She's upset because she believes they should share everything as a sign of trust. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, sharing passwords can be seen as a gesture of trust. If he agreed to share initially, changing it might seem like a betrayal. But on the other hand, he's entitled to his privacy. The girlfriend was going through his messages and old data, which can feel intrusive. \n\nThe key points here are mutual respect for privacy and boundaries. Even if they share a password, that doesn't mean one person should have unrestricted access to all personal information, especially old stuff that's irrelevant now. The boyfriend has the right to set boundaries to protect his personal space. The fact that she was going through his things without his consent is a red flag. \n\nSo, changing the password to regain privacy isn't necessarily wrong. The issue here is more about the girlfriend's actions being overstepping. The boyfriend is trying to assert his privacy, which is a reasonable response. Therefore, he's not in the wrong.\n"
