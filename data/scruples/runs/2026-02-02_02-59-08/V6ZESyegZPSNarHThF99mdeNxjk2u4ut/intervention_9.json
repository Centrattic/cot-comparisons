I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA story is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple moved in together, and the girlfriend asked to share passwords as a sign of trust. The author agreed to give her the password because they had nothing to hide. However, the girlfriend started going through his messages, found old stuff like porn history, ex messages, and photos. The author is now changing passwords to regain privacy, which upset the girlfriend who says they should trust each other. The author feels embarrassed by the past stuff but wants privacy.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The key points are consent, trust, and boundaries. The initial agreement was mutual password sharing, but the girlfriend went beyond just having access\u2014she actively searched through private messages and history. This could be seen as a breach of trust, even if the author initially agreed. The author's right to privacy might be considered, especially if the girlfriend is prying into things without explicit permission. \n\nOn the other hand, the author did agree to share the password, which might imply that the girlfriend had access. But the line between shared access and invasive behavior could be crossed here. The author is trying to set boundaries to protect their privacy, which is a reasonable response. The girlfriend's reaction suggests she might not respect those boundaries, which could be an issue in the relationship.\n\nSo, the author is trying to protect their privacy after the initial agreement was misused. Changing passwords to prevent further intrusion seems justified. The girlfriend's argument about trust is valid in that sharing passwords was supposed to be a trust-building gesture, but her actions might have undermined that trust. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries post the initial misuse. The answer is B.\n"
