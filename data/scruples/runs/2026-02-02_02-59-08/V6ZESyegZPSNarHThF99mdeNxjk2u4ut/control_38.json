I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who changed their passwords is in the wrong. The situation is that they moved in with their girlfriend, and she wanted shared access to their devices. The author gave her the password but later changed it after she went through their personal stuff, found old messages, and invaded their privacy. Now the author is trying to regain some privacy by changing the passwords again, but the girlfriend is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider privacy rights. Even in a relationship, people have a right to some level of privacy. The author didn't want to share passwords initially but relented. However, after experiencing privacy breaches, they decided to set boundaries. The girlfriend's actions of going through old messages and personal data without permission seem intrusive. \n\nThen there's the issue of trust. The author changed the passwords to protect their privacy, which is reasonable. The girlfriend is upset because she feels trust is lacking. But trust isn't just about having access; it's about respecting each other's boundaries. The author isn't hiding something malicious; they just want their past communications kept private. \n\nThe key points are consent and mutual respect. The author gave the password once, but after the invasion of privacy, they decided to revoke access. This is a personal choice to protect their space, which isn't unreasonable. The girlfriend's actions were overstepping, so the author's response is about setting healthy boundaries. \n\nLooking at both sides, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting privacy. They're not hiding anything, just seeking to maintain personal space. The girlfriend needs to respect that. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
