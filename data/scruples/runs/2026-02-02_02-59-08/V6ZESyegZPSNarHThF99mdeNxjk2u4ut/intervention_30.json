I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" story is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. The author moved in with their girlfriend, who wanted shared passwords to show trust. The author initially gave their password but later changed it after the girlfriend went through their private stuff, found old messages, and looked at their phone. The author is now changing passwords again to maintain privacy, and the girlfriend is upset about it.\n\nHmm, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. Let me break this down. The key points here are about privacy and trust in a relationship. The author gave the password initially but had boundaries. However, the girlfriend overstepped by looking through private data, which caused the author discomfort. The author then took steps to protect their privacy, which the girlfriend is now criticizing as a breach of trust.\n\nI need to consider relationship norms. Some people might expect complete transparency, while others believe in maintaining personal boundaries. The author isn't hiding anything; they just want privacy from prying. The girlfriend's actions\u2014snooping through messages, browser history, etc.\u2014are invasive. The author's response is to set a boundary by changing passwords, which is a reasonable action to protect personal space. \n\nIn relationships, mutual respect for each other's privacy is important. If one partner is uncomfortable with the other accessing their devices without consent, that's a red flag. The author isn't doing anything malicious; they're reclaiming their privacy after the other violated it. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. The girlfriend's expectations of trust might be unrealistic if she expects access without permission. Therefore, the answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
