I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for changing their passwords so their girlfriend can't access their devices. The situation is that they moved in together, and the girlfriend wanted shared passwords as a sign of trust. The person initially gave her the password because they had nothing to hide, but now the girlfriend has been going through old stuff, which is embarrassing.\n\nSo, the main points here: the author gave the password but later changed it because they wanted privacy. The girlfriend is upset, saying they should trust each other. The author isn't hiding anything, just uncomfortable with past stuff being found. \n\nHmm. Trust is important in relationships, but so is personal privacy. The girlfriend expected access, maybe thinking it's normal to share everything. But the author feels that their privacy is being invaded when she checks their messages and old files. Even if there's nothing to hide, the act of going through personal items without permission can be a boundary issue.\n\nThe author's action is about protecting their own space, which is a common concern. People have different comfort levels with sharing digital devices. The girlfriend might not realize that sharing passwords can lead to these situations where past actions are scrutinized. The author isn't hiding anything new; it's just old stuff that's causing embarrassment. \n\nSo, is the author wrong for changing passwords? If they communicated their need for privacy and then took action, that's reasonable. The girlfriend might feel betrayed if the password was shared as a sign of trust, but the author had the right to reassess their comfort level. It's a balance between trust and privacy. The key here is that the author explained their reasons, and the issue is about personal boundaries. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for setting those boundaries.\n"
