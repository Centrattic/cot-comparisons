I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong for changing their passwords after their girlfriend accessed their private information. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The guy gave his girlfriend his passwords as a gesture of trust. She then looked through his past conversations, browser history, etc., which made him uncomfortable. He changed the passwords to regain privacy. She's upset because she feels it's a breach of trust.\n\nSo, the core issue is about privacy versus trust in a relationship. The guy initially shared passwords, expecting mutual trust. However, when she accessed his private data without his consent, he felt it was necessary to take back control of his privacy.\n\nFrom a general perspective, while sharing passwords can be a sign of trust, it's also a personal choice. The girlfriend might have thought she had the right to access his information since they're in a relationship. But invading someone's privacy, even in a relationship, without consent is generally considered a violation.\n\nThe guy's action of changing the passwords is a response to protect his privacy. He's not doing it out of mistrust but because he wants to set boundaries. It's his right to have some level of privacy, especially regarding past conversations and personal data that don't involve her. The girlfriend's actions were intrusive, so his response seems reasonable.\n\nHowever, communication is key here. The guy should have discussed his discomfort with her accessing his information before changing the passwords. But given that he tried to set boundaries and she didn't respect them, changing the passwords is a way to enforce those boundaries.\n\nIn relationships, mutual respect and understanding are important. While trust is crucial, it doesn't negate the need for personal privacy. The girlfriend might feel hurt because she believes in full transparency, but the guy's actions were to protect his personal space. \n\nSo, the answer would lean towards the guy not being in the wrong. He's reclaiming his privacy after his partner overstepped. The issue here is more about the girlfriend's actions than the guy's response.\n"
