I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. They mentioned the girlfriend wanted shared passwords as a sign of trust, but the author changed the passwords after she looked through his stuff. The author is now unsure if they're in the wrong because they don't want privacy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend brought up sharing passwords, and the author initially gave her the password. Then the girlfriend accessed personal stuff, which made the author uncomfortable, leading them to change the passwords. The author argues it's about privacy, while the girlfriend thinks trust is important.\n\nI should evaluate both sides. On one hand, trust in a relationship is crucial. If one person is okay with sharing, maybe expecting the same from the other. But on the other hand, privacy is also a personal right. People have the right to control access to their personal devices and data, even in a relationship. The author might feel that their privacy is being invaded when the girlfriend accesses their past stuff without permission, even if it's not harmful.\n\nThe key points are consent and boundaries. The author gave the password initially, but the girlfriend's actions might have crossed the boundaries the author set for themselves. The author's decision to change passwords could be a way to protect their privacy after feeling that their trust was breached. However, the girlfriend might see it as a lack of trust, creating tension.\n\nIt's possible the author isn't in the wrong because they have the right to their privacy. But they might need to communicate better with their partner about their boundaries. Alternatively, if the girlfriend was only looking for signs of infidelity or something harmful, the author's privacy concerns might be valid. But the situation is complex. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a nuanced situation. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting privacy, but they might need to address the communication issues with their partner. The answer could be B (not in the wrong) because privacy is a valid concern, and the author is setting boundaries. However, some might argue that if they agreed to share passwords, changing them without discussing could be a breach of trust. But given the context, the author's actions are more about protecting their privacy after the partner overstepped, so they're justified.\n"
