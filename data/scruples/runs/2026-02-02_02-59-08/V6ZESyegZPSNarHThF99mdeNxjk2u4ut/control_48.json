I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who changed their passwords is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend wanting access to the person's devices, and the person deciding to change the passwords after their girlfriend went through their old stuff.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend wants to share passwords as a sign of trust, which is common in some relationships. But the person in question set boundaries by not sharing their passwords and then changed them after their partner accessed things they found embarrassing. The key here is the concept of privacy versus trust.\n\nThe person might feel that having access to old, irrelevant data is invading their privacy, even if it's not malicious. The girlfriend, on the other hand, might see changing passwords as breaking trust because she expected openness. \n\nIn relationships, boundaries are important. If one partner is uncomfortable with the other having access to their personal devices, they have the right to set that boundary. The fact that the person changed passwords after their partner accessed private info without consent might be a justified self-defense of their privacy. However, communication is key. If the person didn't discuss their discomfort before changing passwords, that could be a problem. But given that the girlfriend kept accessing things despite the person's initial refusal, the action might be necessary to maintain personal space.\n\nI think the person isn't in the wrong because they're protecting their privacy. The girlfriend might need to respect those boundaries, even if she disagrees. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
