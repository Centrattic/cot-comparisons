I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their personal devices.\n\nFirst, the context: The couple moved in together. The girlfriend wanted shared passwords as a sign of trust. The author initially gave her the password but then changed it after she found some old, possibly embarrassing stuff on his devices. He did this to maintain his privacy, and she's upset about it now.\n\nSo, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but they want to know if that's accurate. I need to evaluate both sides. \n\nOn one hand, the girlfriend's request for shared passwords might be about wanting to feel included and to show mutual trust. She might see not sharing as a lack of trust. On the other hand, the author has a right to privacy. People often have personal data from the past that they don't want shared. The fact that she went through his messages without his consent could be a breach of trust from his side, which might justify his need for privacy.\n\nThe author's actions stem from wanting to protect their own privacy after experiencing invasion of privacy from the girlfriend. The key issue here is consent and mutual respect. If the girlfriend accessed his devices without permission, then the author's response is about setting boundaries. \n\nIn relationships, boundaries are important. Just because someone is in a relationship doesn't mean they have to share all their personal information. The author isn't hiding something malicious, just personal history that's not relevant now. Changing passwords to prevent access is a reasonable step. The girlfriend's expectation to have access might be unrealistic if she's prying into things without consent. \n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong. They are asserting their right to privacy after the other party overstepped. The answer should be B.\n"
