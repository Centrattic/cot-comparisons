I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who changed their passwords is in the wrong. The situation involves a girlfriend who wanted shared access to devices as a trust gesture. The guy initially gave her his password but then changed it after she found various things and went through his messages.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend wants transparency, which is common in relationships. She might feel that sharing passwords is a way to show commitment and trust. However, the guy feels that having some privacy is important, especially with old and irrelevant stuff that's now making him uncomfortable. \n\nHe gave her the password first, and she used it to find things. Now he's changing it to maintain his privacy. The key issue here is the balance between trust and personal boundaries. \n\nIn many relationships, mutual respect for each other's privacy is important. Even though he initially shared the password, it's his right to set boundaries if he feels his privacy is being invaded. The fact that she was going through his messages without his consent might be a bigger issue. \n\nHowever, some might argue that if he agreed to share the password, changing it could be seen as a breach of trust. But considering the context\u2014he's entitled to his own space, especially if it's causing him distress. The problem seems more on the girlfriend's side for invading his privacy, not the guy for setting limits. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's asserting his right to privacy after experiencing unwanted intrusion.\n"
