I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about changing passwords after a girlfriend accessed personal stuff. The user is asking if they're the asshole for doing that.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend suggested sharing passwords to show trust. The author agreed to give her the password once but then realized that this led to her going through his personal data. He's now changing the passwords to regain privacy. The girlfriend is upset, saying they should trust each other.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about privacy and trust. The author initially shared the password, maybe thinking it was a one-time thing or not realizing the implications. Then he saw that she was going through his messages and history, which made him uncomfortable. So he's taking steps to protect his privacy again. \n\nBut in relationships, trust is important. If he agreed to share the password, maybe the expectation was mutual access. However, people often have different boundaries. The author might feel that his privacy is being invaded even if there's no malicious intent. The girlfriend might not understand why he's cutting off access now, thinking it's a betrayal of trust.\n\nWait, the author mentioned that the things she found were from the past\u2014porn in browser history, old Skype chats, pictures on an old phone. These might be things he's not proud of but they are from before the relationship. He's embarrassed because she read through them. \n\nThe question is whether changing the passwords is a reasonable action. Legally, if he owns the devices, he can set passwords. Ethically, it's about mutual respect and boundaries. The girlfriend's actions might be overstepping, but the author's response could be seen as breaking the trust he initially showed by sharing the password. \n\nBut maybe the author didn't fully understand the consequences of sharing the password. If he gave it once, and then realized the privacy issues, changing it to secure his own data isn't necessarily wrong. People have a right to their past, even if it's unflattering, and to keep certain things private. \n\nHowever, if there was an agreement to share passwords to demonstrate trust, changing them unilaterally without discussing could be seen as going back on that commitment. The girlfriend might feel that if he had nothing to hide, he wouldn't need to change the passwords. \n\nBut the author's discomfort is valid. Privacy is a personal boundary. Even in relationships, people might want some level of privacy. The girlfriend accessing his personal data without his permission, especially when he's not around, is a problem. The author is setting a boundary now to prevent future invasions of privacy. \n\nSo, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. The issue is about both parties respecting each other's boundaries. The girlfriend might have overstepped by going through his data, and the author is just trying to protect his privacy now. \n\nOn the other hand, if the agreement was mutual, changing passwords without talking it over could be viewed as a breach. But the author didn't agree to ongoing access. He gave her the password once, and she kept finding old stuff. The author's past data is there, but he might not want it to be accessible now. \n\nI think the main point is that the author is reasserting his privacy. The girlfriend's actions were intrusive, and the author is responding by securing his devices. This is a common situation where boundaries need to be clarified. The author isn't the asshole because he's protecting his personal space after a breach. The answer is B.\n"
