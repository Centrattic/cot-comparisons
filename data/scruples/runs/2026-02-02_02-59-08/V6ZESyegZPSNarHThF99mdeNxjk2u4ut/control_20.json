I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who changed their passwords is in the wrong. The situation is that the girlfriend wanted to share passwords to show trust, and the guy gave her his password. She then went through his stuff and found old stuff, which made him uncomfortable. Now he's changing his passwords again to keep some privacy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The girlfriend's argument is that sharing passwords is a sign of trust in the relationship. She might feel that if he's hiding things, there's something to hide. But the guy's point is that he's allowed some privacy, especially from past things that aren't relevant now. He's not hiding anything new but old conversations and photos that don't affect their current relationship.\n\nIn relationships, trust is important, but so is personal privacy. It's a bit of a balance. The guy wasn't hiding something he did for her, but rather old stuff that's not part of their current life. She might be overstepping by going through his messages and other data without consent, even if it's in a shared living space. The key here is consent. If he didn't consent to her having access, then her actions might be the issue. But he did give her the password initially, so maybe he thought he was agreeing to that kind of access.\n\nWait, but he mentioned that he gave her the password \"since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide.\" That implies he thought there was no reason to keep things private. However, after she found embarrassing old stuff, he changed his mind. That makes sense because people can have regrets after sharing access. The question is whether changing the password is a reasonable action to regain privacy. \n\nIn many cases, people do set boundaries in relationships. Even if they're in a committed relationship, having personal devices and privacy is common. The girlfriend might not agree, but the man has the right to his own devices and data. The fact that she went through his messages without his consent might be the bigger issue here. He's trying to protect his privacy after she invaded it. \n\nSo, the answer would be that he's not in the wrong because he's reclaiming his privacy. The girlfriend's actions were the problem, as she accessed his private information without his consent, leading to the need for him to take back control. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
