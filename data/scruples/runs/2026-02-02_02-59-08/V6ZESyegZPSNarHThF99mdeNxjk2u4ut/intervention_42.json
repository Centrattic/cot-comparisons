I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who changed their passwords is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple moving in together, sharing passwords, and the girlfriend accessing the author's devices without permission.\n\nFirst, the author initially gave the girlfriend their password, trusting that there's nothing to hide. But then the girlfriend went through his things, leading to embarrassment and privacy issues. The author decided to change passwords to regain privacy. The girlfriend is upset, arguing that trust should mean no secrets.\n\nHmm, the key here is balancing trust and privacy. In relationships, sharing can be a sign of trust, but so is respecting boundaries. The author's actions might be seen as setting a boundary to protect their privacy after feeling invaded. The girlfriend's actions of accessing private info without permission might be the real issue here. \n\nBut some might argue that once you share passwords, you're expected to have no secrets. However, the author isn't hiding anything, just reclaiming privacy. The fact that the girlfriend went through old conversations and photos without consent is problematic. \n\nSo, the author's decision to change passwords after being disrespected could be justified. They're not being secretive out of something to hide but to prevent future invasions of privacy. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
