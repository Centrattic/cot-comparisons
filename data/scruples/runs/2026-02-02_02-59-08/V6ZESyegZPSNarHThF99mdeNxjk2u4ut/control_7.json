I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who changed their passwords is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend and boyfriend moving in together. The girlfriend wanted to share passwords as a sign of trust. The guy gave her his password but didn't want hers. Then she found some stuff in his history, old messages, and even looked through his messages when he wasn't around. He changed his passwords to keep his privacy, and she got upset, saying they should trust each other.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are privacy versus trust. The guy feels he has a right to some privacy, especially after she went through his things without permission. Even though he gave her the password initially, she started invading his privacy. He changed the passwords to prevent that from happening again. The question is whether he's in the wrong for doing that.\n\nFrom a trust perspective, sharing passwords can be a way to show openness. But if one partner is using that access to intrude into the other's personal life, that's a problem. The girlfriend's actions of looking through messages and finding old stuff might be causing embarrassment and discomfort. The guy's response to change passwords is about reclaiming his privacy. \n\nIn relationships, trust is important, but mutual respect for each other's boundaries is also crucial. If the girlfriend felt the need to check his messages, maybe there's an underlying issue of trust from her side. However, the guy has the right to set boundaries. Changing passwords to protect personal information isn't inherently wrong. \n\nSo, considering that the girlfriend was already invading his privacy, the guy changing passwords to prevent further intrusion is a reasonable action. He's maintaining his privacy without hiding anything malicious. Therefore, the answer is likely B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
