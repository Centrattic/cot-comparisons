I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. The situation involves the girlfriend wanting to share passwords as a show of trust, but after she accessed some personal stuff, he decides to change them.\n\nFirst, the key points here are privacy and trust. The author agreed to share their password initially, which the girlfriend used to access things he found embarrassing. Now he wants his privacy back. Is it reasonable to expect privacy in a relationship? I think so. Even in committed relationships, people often have personal space and private communications. The girlfriend's actions might be overstepping by going through his messages and history without his consent.\n\nThe author isn't hiding anything malicious; he's just reclaiming his privacy. The fact that he was open about his reasons and that the content she found was from the past and not relevant now suggests he's not being secretive. The girlfriend's expectation that they should trust each other by sharing all access might be unrealistic. Trust is important, but it should be mutual and respectful of each other's boundaries.\n\nHowever, the initial agreement to share passwords set a precedent. The author then changed the passwords after the fact, which could be seen as breaking that trust. But given that the girlfriend used that access to intrude on his privacy, maybe the author's action is justified. It's about balancing trust with personal boundaries. The right answer likely depends on cultural or societal norms around privacy in relationships.\n\nIn many cases, people expect that while they share a life, they still have personal devices and private communications. The girlfriend's behavior seems intrusive, so the author's decision to secure his devices is reasonable. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
