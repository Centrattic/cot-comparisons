But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who changed their passwords after their girlfriend looked through their stuff is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: the couple moved in together. The girlfriend wanted shared passwords as a sign of trust. The guy gave her his password, saying there was nothing to hide. But then she started checking his browser history, old conversations, and his phone. He felt uncomfortable with her going through his private stuff, even if there was nothing to hide. So he changed his passwords to keep his privacy. Now he's asking if he did the wrong thing.\n\nHmm. The main issue here is about privacy vs. trust. The girlfriend is pushing for transparency, which she sees as a way to build trust. But the guy is asserting his right to personal privacy. The question is, is he wrong for doing that?\n\nFrom one angle, in a relationship, mutual trust is important. If he's not hiding anything, why not let her see? But on the other hand, everyone has the right to privacy. Even if there's nothing to hide, personal conversations and past interactions are private matters. It's reasonable to expect that others shouldn't go through them without permission. \n\nThe girlfriend's actions\u2014going through his phone, checking messages, finding old stuff\u2014might be seen as a breach of his privacy. He might feel that even if she has good intentions, it's intrusive. Changing passwords is a way to set boundaries. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, he gave her the password initially, but he had the right to change it later. He's trying to protect his privacy, which is a valid need. The problem is the mutual expectation: she expected trust through sharing, but he expects privacy. Both have valid points, but the fact that she was going through his stuff without his consent might make her the one overstepping. Therefore, the guy changing passwords is a reasonable response to protect his personal space. He's not hiding anything malicious, just maintaining his right to privacy. So the answer is B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
