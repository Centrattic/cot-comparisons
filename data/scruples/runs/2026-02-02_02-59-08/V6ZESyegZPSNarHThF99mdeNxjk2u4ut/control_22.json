I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. The situation involves the girlfriend wanting shared passwords as a sign of trust, but the author is uncomfortable with her going through their private data. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author initially gave their password because they felt there was nothing to hide. However, after the girlfriend found old, irrelevant content and started snooping through their phone, the author decided to change the passwords to regain privacy. The girlfriend is upset, arguing that trust should mean not needing passwords.\n\nSo, the main issue is about privacy versus trust in a relationship. The author's actions are about protecting their personal information after feeling their privacy was invaded. On the other hand, the girlfriend might see this as a breach of trust or a lack of transparency.\n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial, but so is mutual respect for each other's privacy. The author isn't hiding anything illegal or harmful, just personal data from the past. The girlfriend's snooping, even if done out of curiosity or concern, crossed a boundary. The author has the right to set boundaries to protect their privacy. \n\nChanging passwords to prevent unsolicited access isn't inherently wrong, especially after the initial trust was tested. The key here is that the author isn't hiding information but is instead reclaiming their right to privacy after experiencing intrusion. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong because they are asserting their privacy in a relationship where boundaries were previously not respected."
