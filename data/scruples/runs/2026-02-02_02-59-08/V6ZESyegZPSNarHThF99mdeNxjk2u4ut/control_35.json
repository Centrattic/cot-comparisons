I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who changed their passwords is in the wrong. The situation is that they and their girlfriend moved in together, and she wanted to share passwords as a sign of trust. The author initially gave her the password but then changed it after she went through his old stuff and found things that embarrassed him. Now he's considering changing passwords again to keep his privacy, and she's upset about it.\n\nSo, the key points here are trust, privacy, and boundaries. The girlfriend wants full access, while the author wants some privacy. The author gave the password once but changed it when he felt his privacy was invaded. The question is, is he wrong for doing that?\n\nFirst, I need to consider that in a relationship, trust is important. The girlfriend might see not sharing passwords as a breach of trust. On the other hand, everyone has a right to some level of privacy. The author isn't hiding anything malicious\u2014he's just uncomfortable with past, irrelevant stuff being brought up. \n\nThe fact that she went through his messages without his consent is a problem. That's a violation of privacy, regardless of the relationship. So, the author changing the passwords could be a reasonable response to protect his privacy after her actions. \n\nBut then again, if both agreed to share passwords as a gesture of trust, the author might be going against that agreement. However, the initial agreement might have been one-sided if the author didn't expect her to access everything. The girlfriend might be overstepping by going through his stuff, which is why the author is adjusting the passwords to prevent further invasions.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, it's about boundaries. If he's not hiding anything illegal or harmful, maintaining some privacy is reasonable. The problem is that the girlfriend isn't respecting his boundaries by accessing his devices without consent. So, the author is justified in setting those boundaries by changing passwords. Therefore, the answer might be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nBut I need to check if there's an argument for A. If the author initially gave her the password and now changed it, that could be seen as breaking trust. However, if she violated his privacy, then changing passwords is a self-protective measure. The key is mutual consent and respect for boundaries. Since she crossed that boundary, the author is within his rights to adjust his privacy settings. So the answer is B.\n"
