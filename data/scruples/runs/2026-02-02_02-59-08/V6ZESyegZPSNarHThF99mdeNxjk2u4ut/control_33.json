I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the couple moved in together. The girlfriend wanted to share passwords as a sign of trust. The author initially gave her the password but later changed it after the girlfriend went through his personal data. The author is now changing passwords again to maintain privacy, which the girlfriend is upset about because she feels it's a breach of trust.\n\nNow, considering the key points: The author gave the password once but now wants privacy. The girlfriend is invading his privacy by looking through his old messages and files. The author is taking steps to protect their own privacy, which might be justified because personal devices are expected to have some privacy even in relationships.\n\nThe conflict here is between trust and privacy. The author isn't hiding anything malicious but wants to keep past, irrelevant data private. The girlfriend might see this as a lack of trust. However, mutual respect for each other's privacy is important. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. Changing passwords to prevent unwanted access is a reasonable action to maintain personal space. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
