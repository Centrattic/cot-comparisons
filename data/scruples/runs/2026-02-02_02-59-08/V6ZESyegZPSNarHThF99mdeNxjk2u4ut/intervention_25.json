I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices.\n\nFirst, the situation: They moved in together, and the girlfriend wanted shared passwords as a sign of trust. The author gave her the password, and the girlfriend then found various things in the browser history, old messages, and even looked through the author's phone when they weren't around. The author now wants to change the passwords to regain privacy, but the girlfriend is upset, arguing that trust should mean sharing.\n\nSo, the core issue here is privacy versus trust. The author's actions are a response to the girlfriend invading their privacy after they had given her access. The author isn't hiding anything harmful or illegal but finds it embarrassing and invasive for their past to be scrutinized. The girlfriend, on her part, might see the password sharing as a mutual agreement, so when the author pulls back, she feels betrayed or that trust is being broken.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The key points are:\n\n1. The author gave the password initially, but the girlfriend used that access to invade the author's privacy (looking through messages, finding old stuff). This could be seen as a breach of trust, not just in terms of the author's actions but in the girlfriend's actions as well. If mutual trust was the basis for sharing passwords, then the girlfriend's actions might have already broken that trust.\n\n2. The author is now protecting their privacy by changing passwords. This is a reasonable response to protect personal information, especially since the other person has already used the access to invade their privacy. The author's right to privacy is a valid concern here. Even if there's nothing to hide, the invasion of privacy can be hurtful.\n\n3. The girlfriend's argument that trust is necessary for sharing passwords is valid in a relationship context, but if one party is misusing that access, the other has the right to withdraw it. Trust should be mutual, and if one side is not respecting the other's privacy, the trust is unbalanced.\n\n4. The author isn't hiding anything illegal or harmful; the content found was just embarrassing. This makes the situation more about personal boundaries rather than deceit.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author is not in the wrong for wanting to protect their privacy after experiencing invasion from their partner. The initial sharing of the password might have been a mistake if it led to that situation, but the author's response is understandable and justified to maintain their personal space. The girlfriend's actions were the first breach, so the author's decision to change passwords is a reasonable step to set boundaries. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong)."
