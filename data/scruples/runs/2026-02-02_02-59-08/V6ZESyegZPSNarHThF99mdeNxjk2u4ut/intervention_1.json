I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about changing passwords to prevent a girlfriend from accessing their computer and phone. The girlfriend wanted shared passwords to show trust, but the author gave her the password once, and then the girlfriend found old stuff and started prying. The author changed the passwords to regain privacy.\n\nHmm. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to decide between A or B. \n\nFirst, the girlfriend's perspective: she's in a trusting relationship and expected shared access as a sign of commitment. But the author might feel that their privacy is being invaded. The girlfriend went through old messages and stuff, which the author finds embarrassing even if it's not harmful. \n\nTrust is a big part of a relationship, but so is personal privacy. The author didn't hide anything malicious, just old, irrelevant stuff. The girlfriend's actions might be overstepping, even if she had the password. The author changed the passwords to set a boundary. \n\nIs changing passwords a breach of trust? Maybe, but if the other person is invading privacy despite the password being shared, the author has a right to protect their space. The key here is mutual respect for boundaries. The author isn't hiding anything illegal or harmful, just personal history. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is upset, which is understandable, but the author's need for privacy is also valid. Maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they're setting healthy boundaries. So the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
