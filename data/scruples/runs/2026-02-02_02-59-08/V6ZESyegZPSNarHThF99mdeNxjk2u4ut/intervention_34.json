I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the couple moved in together, and the girlfriend wanted to share passwords as a sign of trust. The author gave her the password but later changed it when the girlfriend started going through his stuff, like browser history, old messages, and even his phone. The author felt entitled to some privacy and decided to secure their devices, leading to conflict.\n\nNow, the key points here are trust and boundaries. The author initially agreed to share the password but later changed it, which is understandable if they felt uncomfortable with the level of access. The girlfriend, on the other hand, might see this as a breach of trust since they were supposed to be open with each other. \n\nI need to consider both perspectives. The author has a right to privacy, especially regarding personal matters from the past. It's reasonable to want to protect that. However, changing passwords after sharing them could be seen as breaking trust if that was part of an agreement. But the context is important here: the girlfriend was prying into things the author didn't want her to see, which adds a layer of invasion of privacy. \n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial, but so is mutual respect for each other's boundaries. The author might not be in the wrong because they're setting boundaries to protect their privacy, especially after experiencing discomfort. The girlfriend's actions of going through his stuff without permission are more concerning. \n\nSo, while the author could have communicated their discomfort earlier, their decision to change passwords is about reclaiming privacy. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
