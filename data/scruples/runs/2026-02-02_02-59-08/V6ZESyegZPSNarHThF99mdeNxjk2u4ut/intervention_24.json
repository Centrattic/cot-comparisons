I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) post is in the wrong for changing passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. The user initially thought the author might be at fault but wants my opinion.\n\nSo, the situation is that the girlfriend wanted to share passwords as a sign of trust. The author agreed but later changed the passwords when the girlfriend started going through his personal data. The key points here are consent, trust, and boundaries in a relationship.\n\nFirst, the author gave the password willingly, which implies a mutual agreement to share access. However, the girlfriend's actions\u2014looking through private data like browser history, old messages, and photos\u2014could be seen as a breach of trust. Even if the author doesn't mind the content, the invasion of privacy is problematic.\n\nIn many relationships, mutual trust is essential, but that doesn't mean one partner should have unrestricted access to the other's private information. The author has the right to privacy, especially regarding personal conversations and past relationships. The girlfriend's behavior might feel intrusive, so changing the passwords could be an attempt to set boundaries.\n\nThe author isn't hiding anything but is reclaiming their privacy. The girlfriend's expectation that they \"should\" trust her by allowing full access might be unrealistic. Trust doesn't require complete transparency if it leads to discomfort.\n\nHowever, communication is key. The author should have discussed the boundaries earlier, maybe before sharing the passwords. But given the context, the author's decision to change passwords after experiencing privacy violations makes sense. It's about balancing trust with personal privacy.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The girlfriend's actions crossed a boundary, so the author is justified in setting limits. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
