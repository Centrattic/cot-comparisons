I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and their girlfriend moved in together. She wanted to share passwords as a sign of trust. The author was okay with sharing their password because they had nothing to hide but didn't want her password. However, once she had access, she started looking through his old stuff, which made him uncomfortable. Now he's changed his passwords again, and she's upset, arguing that trust should mean he doesn't need privacy. He's unsure if he's wrong for doing that.\n\nThe key points here are about privacy versus trust in a relationship. The author is setting boundaries to protect his personal space, while the girlfriend feels that trust requires full access. \n\nIn relationships, it's common for partners to have differing views on privacy. Some people value their personal space and digital privacy, while others see sharing as a way to build trust. The author had initially shared his password but found that the access led to invasion of his privacy. By changing the passwords, he's reclaiming his privacy. \n\nIs that in the wrong? Well, the author isn't hiding anything malicious; he's just uncomfortable with his personal history being accessed. The girlfriend's actions of going through his messages and past history without his consent might be the bigger issue here. The author is responding to her intrusion by setting boundaries. \n\nOn the other hand, agreeing to share passwords implies that you're okay with someone having access. If he changed the passwords after agreeing to share, that could be seen as breaking trust. However, the context is that the access was being misused, leading to privacy breaches. The author's action is a reasonable step to protect his privacy after experiencing a lack of respect for his personal space.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. He's adjusting his boundaries because the previous arrangement wasn't working. The real issue might be that the girlfriend isn't respecting his privacy and is overstepping. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
