I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The guy is asking if he's in the wrong for changing his passwords so his girlfriend can't access his devices anymore. They moved in together, and she wanted shared passwords as a trust thing. He gave her his password but then she started going through his stuff, finding old stuff like browser history, old messages, and even checking his phone when he wasn't around.\n\nFirst, the key points here are privacy vs. trust. The woman wanted shared passwords to show trust, which is a common practice in some couples. But when he gave her the password, she used it to invade his privacy by looking through his old data and messages. The guy found this uncomfortable and decided to take back his privacy by changing the passwords. He's not hiding anything; he's just trying to maintain some personal space. \n\nNow, the girlfriend is upset because she feels it's a breach of trust. But trust shouldn't require someone to have unrestricted access to another's personal devices. The act of changing passwords is about setting boundaries, which is reasonable. Everyone deserves some privacy, even in a relationship. The fact that she went through his messages without his consent is the real issue here. \n\nThe guy isn't doing anything wrong by protecting his own privacy. He's not hiding anything, just preventing unwanted access. The girlfriend's actions were invasive, and his response is a form of self-respect and boundary-setting. So, the answer should be B (No) because he's not in the wrong; he's asserting his right to privacy after she overstepped.\n"
