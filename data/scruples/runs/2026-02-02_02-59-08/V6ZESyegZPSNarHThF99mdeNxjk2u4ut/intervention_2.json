I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. The situation is about privacy versus trust in a relationship.\n\nFirst, the author initially agreed to share their password, which they did because they felt there was nothing to hide. But then the girlfriend started going through their personal data, like old browser history, messages, and old photos. The author finds this behavior intrusive and decides to change the passwords to regain their privacy. The girlfriend is upset, arguing that trust is important and there's no need for separate passwords.\n\nSo, the key points here are about mutual trust and privacy. In relationships, especially when couples move in together, there's often a balance between sharing and maintaining individual privacy. The author was okay with sharing at first, but the girlfriend's actions made the author uncomfortable. The author isn't hiding anything malicious, just personal or embarrassing content from the past. Changing passwords is a way to set a boundary.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The girlfriend's actions of going through messages without permission are a breach of privacy. The author is responding to protect their own privacy, which is a reasonable step. The girlfriend may feel that trust is being undermined, but the author's actions are more about respecting personal boundaries. \n\nThe initial agreement to share might have made the girlfriend feel entitled to access, but the author's discomfort arises from the actual behavior of snooping. So, the author is not necessarily in the wrong for setting boundaries, especially after experiencing invasion of privacy. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They are asserting their right to privacy in response to the girlfriend's actions.\n"
