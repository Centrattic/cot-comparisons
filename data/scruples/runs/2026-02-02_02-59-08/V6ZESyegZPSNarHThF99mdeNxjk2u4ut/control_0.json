I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for changing their passwords so their girlfriend can't access their devices. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe user moved in with their girlfriend and she wanted to share passwords as a sign of trust. He agreed to give her his password, saying there was nothing to hide. But then she started going through his stuff\u2014browser history, old Skype conversations, pictures, and even his phone messages when he wasn't looking. He found this intrusive and changed the passwords to regain privacy. The girlfriend is upset, saying there should be trust, but he feels he needs his privacy back.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are trust versus privacy. The girlfriend seems to want openness, which is common in relationships. However, the user is asserting their right to personal space. The problem arises when she goes through his things without his consent, which is a boundary issue. He changed the passwords after she violated his privacy, so he's trying to set boundaries. \n\nIs he in the wrong for changing passwords? Well, he initially gave her the password, but after her actions, he felt the need to revoke access. He's not hiding anything; he's just trying to protect his past from being pried into. The girlfriend is acting in a way that's invasive, so maybe the user is justified in taking back control. \n\nAlternatively, some might say that once you share a password, you have to accept the consequences. But in this case, the user didn't ask for her to snoop. He gave her the password, but she went beyond just having access. She's actively invading his privacy. So changing the passwords is a reasonable response to protect his personal space. \n\nI think the user isn't in the wrong. He's setting boundaries after her actions made him feel uncomfortable. The real issue is the girlfriend's behavior\u2014going through his stuff without consent. The user is just trying to maintain his privacy, which is a valid need even in a relationship. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
