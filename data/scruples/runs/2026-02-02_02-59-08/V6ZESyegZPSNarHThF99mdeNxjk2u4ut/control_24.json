I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices.\n\nFirst, the context: the girlfriend wants shared passwords as a sign of trust. The author initially gave her the password, explaining that they didn't mind since there's nothing to hide. However, the girlfriend ended up looking through personal data\u2014porn history, old conversations, photos of girls from past phones, and even checked messages when the author wasn't around. The author feels embarrassed by these intrusions and decides to change passwords to regain privacy. The girlfriend is upset, arguing that trust should mean no privacy barriers.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics. The key points here are privacy vs. trust. The author is setting a boundary to protect their personal space, which is a reasonable expectation. Everyone has a right to some level of privacy, even in a relationship. The girlfriend's actions, however, cross into invasive territory. Looking through private messages and old data without consent isn't just about curiosity; it's a breach of trust. The author's response is to reclaim that privacy, which is a valid self-defense measure.\n\nThe girlfriend's perspective is that sharing passwords is about mutual trust. But trust shouldn't require one person to have unrestricted access to another's private life, especially if it leads to prying without consent. The author's discomfort with the invasion of privacy is justified. They're not hiding anything malicious, just personal history that's now irrelevant. The fact that the girlfriend found these things and continues to push for access shows she might not respect the author's boundaries.\n\nIn relationships, healthy boundaries are crucial. The author is asserting their right to privacy, which is their prerogative. The girlfriend's reaction (being upset) stems from feeling that the author isn't fully trusting her, but the author's actions are about maintaining personal space, not deceit. So, the author isn't in the wrong for setting these boundaries. The real issue might be the girlfriend's lack of respect for those boundaries initially.\n"
