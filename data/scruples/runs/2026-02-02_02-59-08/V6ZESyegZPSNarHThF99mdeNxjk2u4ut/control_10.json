I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong for changing their passwords. The situation is about a couple moving in together and the girlfriend wanting to share passwords as a trust exercise. The author initially agreed but later changed their mind when the girlfriend accessed personal information.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend brought up the idea of sharing passwords to show trust. The author was okay with it but now feels the need to change passwords due to privacy concerns after some uncomfortable discoveries by the girlfriend. The author's main point is about maintaining personal privacy even in a relationship. \n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial, but so is personal boundaries. The author gave the passwords expecting that the girlfriend wouldn't go through their stuff, which implies mutual trust. However, the girlfriend did look into old messages and browser history, which makes the author uncomfortable. The key here is whether the girlfriend overstepped by accessing his personal data, leading the author to set new boundaries.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. Legally, I don't think so. Passwords are personal, and changing them is a way to protect one's privacy. However, the social or relational aspect is more complex. The girlfriend might perceive it as a lack of trust, but the author is reacting to actual breaches of privacy. The fact that the author's ex was found in old data and the girlfriend accessing messages without consent shows that the initial agreement to share passwords was perhaps not respected by the girlfriend. \n\nSo, the author deciding to change passwords to reclaim their privacy isn't in the wrong. They have the right to set boundaries. The girlfriend's behavior might have been the real issue here. The answer should be B, No.\n"
