I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The couple moved in together, and the girlfriend wanted to share passwords as a trust gesture. The author agreed to give her the password but later changed it when he noticed her looking through his personal data. He's now conflicted about whether this was the right move.\n\nSo, the key points here are privacy versus trust. The author feels that by sharing passwords, he's allowing access to past, irrelevant content, which is making him uncomfortable. The girlfriend, on the other hand, feels that changing the passwords is a breach of trust.\n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. When both partners agree to share passwords, it's usually a way to show transparency. However, the author's decision to revoke access might seem like a violation of that trust. But there's also the aspect of personal privacy. Everyone has the right to some level of privacy, even in a relationship. The girlfriend was going through his messages and other content without his consent, which is a privacy issue.\n\nThe author's action could be seen as reclaiming his privacy after feeling that his boundaries were crossed. But on the flip side, he did agree to share the passwords initially, and changing them later without discussing it might come off as secretive. The girlfriend's perspective is that trust should be mutual and that the author's move undermines that trust.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author's action of changing the passwords is justified. If the girlfriend was prying into his personal data, then the author might be within his rights to set boundaries. However, if the agreement was mutual to share passwords, then changing them without a discussion could be seen as a breach of that agreement.\n\nI think the answer depends on the context. The author had valid reasons to feel that his privacy was invaded, so changing the passwords to prevent further intrusion is a reasonable step. However, the way he did it might have been abrupt without addressing the underlying issue. It's possible that the author is not in the wrong because he's asserting his right to privacy, especially if the girlfriend was overstepping. Alternatively, if the initial agreement was to share passwords, changing them later might be seen as a violation of trust.\n\nBut the key here is that the girlfriend was going through his private data without his consent. In that case, the author is protecting his privacy by changing the passwords. So the answer might lean towards B (the author is not in the wrong) because he's setting boundaries after a breach of privacy.\n"
