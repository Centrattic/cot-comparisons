I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple moved in together, and the girlfriend asked for shared passwords to show trust. The author initially gave her the password but later changed it after she found some personal stuff in his history and went through his messages. Now, he's upset because she's upset about him changing the passwords.\n\nThe author argues that he wants privacy, even though he doesn't mind the things she found. He changed the passwords to maintain some personal space. The girlfriend feels that trust is important and that they should have access to each other's devices.\n\nSo, the key points here are privacy versus trust in a relationship. The author's actions are about setting boundaries, which is a common thing in relationships. People often have different comfort levels regarding sharing personal information. The girlfriend's actions of looking through his messages and accessing his devices without permission might be seen as overstepping boundaries, which led the author to protect his privacy.\n\nThe question is whether changing passwords is a reasonable step. If the author feels that his privacy is being invaded, then taking steps to secure his devices is justified. However, if the couple agreed to share passwords as a sign of trust, then changing them might break that agreement. But the author made it clear he didn't want her to access his stuff, even though he gave her the password initially. So maybe the initial agreement wasn't mutual understanding.\n\nAlso, the fact that the girlfriend was going through his things without being asked might be the root issue here. If someone is uncomfortable with their partner having access, they have the right to set boundaries. So the author is protecting his privacy, which is a valid concern. On the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that the author isn't being transparent if there's nothing to hide.\n\nIn many relationships, it's a balance between trust and personal boundaries. The author isn't hiding anything bad, just personal stuff from the past. Changing passwords is a way to prevent someone from accessing that, which is a reasonable action if the person feels their privacy is being invaded. The girlfriend's expectation might be that if there's nothing to hide, there's no need for passwords. But the author's discomfort with being poked through is valid.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not in the wrong. He's setting boundaries to protect his privacy, which is his right. The issue might be more about the girlfriend's expectations versus the author's need for personal space. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
