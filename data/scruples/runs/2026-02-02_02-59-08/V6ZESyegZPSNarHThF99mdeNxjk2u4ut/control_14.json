I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who changed their passwords is in the wrong. The situation involves a girlfriend wanting shared access to devices, but the person decided to change passwords after their partner started looking through personal stuff.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend asked for shared passwords as a gesture of trust. The author initially gave her the password but later changed it after the girlfriend found old, irrelevant content and started snooping. The key points here are privacy and trust. The author doesn't have anything to hide, but they feel their privacy was invaded. \n\nThe girlfriend is upset because she feels the password change is a breach of trust. However, the author had reasons: their partner was going through old messages and personal items, which is a privacy issue. The author is trying to set boundaries. \n\nIn relationships, mutual respect for privacy is important. Even in a trusting relationship, people should have their own space. The girlfriend's actions of sifting through old content without permission are invasive. The author changing passwords to protect their privacy is a reasonable response. It's not about hiding things but maintaining personal boundaries. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They're asserting their right to privacy after experiencing a breach. The answer should be B.\n"
