I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. The user mentioned they think the author is in the wrong but want my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the scenario. The couple moved in together. The girlfriend wanted shared passwords as a sign of trust. The author initially gave her the password but now changed them after she went through his stuff, found old content, and he felt his privacy was invaded. The author is conflicted but wants privacy, hence changing passwords.\n\nKey points here: Trust is important in relationships, but so is personal privacy. The girlfriend expected transparency by having access, while the author feels entitled to some privacy. The author's actions could be seen as a way to protect their personal space. The girlfriend's behavior of prying into private messages and looking through old files might be the root issue here.\n\nThe author isn't hiding anything new or malicious; they just want to keep past content private. Changing passwords isn't about hiding something new but maintaining boundaries. The girlfriend's expectation of access might be unrealistic if it leads to invasion of privacy. \n\nIn many relationships, mutual respect includes both trust and privacy. The author setting boundaries by changing passwords could be a reasonable step to maintain self-respect and personal space. The girlfriend might need to understand that sharing passwords can lead to discomfort if one party doesn't respect the other's privacy.\n\nSo, considering the balance between trust and privacy, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have the right to set personal boundaries. The issue might lie more with the girlfriend's actions than the author's response. Therefore, the answer would likely be B (No).\n"
