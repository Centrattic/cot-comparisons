I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Alright, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong after changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. The key points here involve privacy versus trust in a relationship.\n\nFirst, the author initially gave the girlfriend access, stating there's nothing to hide. However, the girlfriend found old, personal content and even snooped through the author's phone. The author then changed the passwords to regain some privacy, leading to the girlfriend's upset reaction.\n\nNow, considering the context, the author's actions are about setting boundaries. Even though they initially shared passwords, it's their right to adjust their privacy if they feel comfortable with it. The girlfriend's intrusion into personal messages and past data without consent is a breach of trust. \n\nIn relationships, mutual respect for privacy is crucial. While open communication is important, the author isn't obligated to share every detail. They have the right to protect their personal space without being seen as untrustworthy. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from insecurity, but that doesn't justify her actions. \n\nTherefore, the author changing passwords isn't in the wrong. They're asserting their right to privacy without violating trust, as the girlfriend's snooping was the real issue. The correct answer is B (No).\n"
