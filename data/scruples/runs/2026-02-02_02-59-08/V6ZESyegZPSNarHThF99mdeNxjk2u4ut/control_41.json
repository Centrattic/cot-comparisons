I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for changing their passwords so their girlfriend can't access their devices anymore.\n\nSo the situation is they moved in together, and the girlfriend wanted shared passwords to show trust. The author initially gave her their password but then changed it after the girlfriend went through some personal stuff like old messages, porn history, and conversations. The author feels embarrassed and wants privacy, so they changed the passwords. The girlfriend is upset because she thinks they should trust each other.\n\nHmm. Trust is a big part of relationships, but so is personal privacy. The author gave the password initially, which allowed the girlfriend access, but then the girlfriend went through their private data, which the author found intrusive. The author is changing passwords to regain some privacy. \n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, sharing passwords can be a way to show trust, but if one partner is invading the other's privacy after being given access, that's a problem. The author is not hiding anything bad; they just want to keep past, irrelevant stuff private. \n\nThe key points are that the girlfriend was going through the author's messages without permission and the author is reclaiming privacy. The author isn't hiding something new or harmful but protecting past information that doesn't affect their current relationship. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the girlfriend expected full access without boundaries, maybe she's overstepping. The author has the right to personal space and privacy, even in a relationship. Changing passwords isn't about hiding something but setting boundaries. Therefore, the answer is probably B (the author isn't in the wrong). They're protecting their privacy after the other person breached it.\n"
