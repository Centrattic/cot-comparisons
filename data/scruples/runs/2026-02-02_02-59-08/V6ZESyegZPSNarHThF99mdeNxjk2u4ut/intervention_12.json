I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. The scenario involves the girlfriend wanting shared passwords as a sign of trust, while the author feels the need for privacy after she went through his stuff.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend wanted to share passwords, which is common in some relationships as a gesture of trust. The author gave her his password initially because he had nothing to hide but later changed it after she invaded his privacy by checking his messages, browsing history, and old devices. The key issue here is the balance between trust and privacy.\n\nThe author's actions could be seen as self-protective. If the girlfriend was already invading his privacy despite his initial openness, changing passwords might be a reasonable step to set boundaries. On the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that changing passwords without discussion breaches the trust she expected. But the author's right to privacy is also valid, especially after experiencing intrusion.\n\nI should think about whether there's a standard expectation in relationships about password sharing. Some people share passwords as a sign of trust, but others maintain personal privacy. The problem here is that the girlfriend went through private information without consent, which is a violation of privacy regardless. The author's response is about reclaiming control over his own data.\n\nAnother angle is communication. Did the author adequately explain his reasons for changing the passwords? The question says he told her he was changing them because he wanted privacy, but she was upset. Maybe a lack of mutual understanding here. However, the author's actions are a direct response to her actions, which were intrusive.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about whether the author overstepped by changing passwords. If the girlfriend expected shared access, then changing the password could be seen as breaking that agreement. But if the initial agreement was mutual and the author felt his privacy was invaded, adjusting boundaries is reasonable. The author isn't wrong for protecting his privacy after being invaded.\n\nSo, considering all this, I think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
