I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who changed their passwords is in the wrong. The situation involves a girlfriend who wanted shared passwords as a sign of trust, but the person felt the need to change them after the girlfriend went through his private data.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend initiated the idea of sharing passwords. The author gave her his password but later felt his privacy was invaded when she accessed personal information. The key here is the expectation of privacy. Even in a relationship, people often expect some level of privacy. The fact that she went through old messages, found personal stuff, and he felt embarrassed matters. \n\nThe author changed the passwords to regain control over his privacy. The girlfriend is upset because she feels it's a breach of trust. But trust doesn't mean you have to give up all privacy. Healthy relationships balance trust with mutual respect for personal space. \n\nThe girlfriend's actions of snooping through his messages without his knowledge or consent are problematic. The author's response to set boundaries by changing passwords is a reasonable way to protect his privacy. He's not hiding anything malicious; he just wants to keep past, non-relevant data private. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the author isn't in the wrong. He's asserting his right to privacy after his boundaries were crossed. The girlfriend might need to respect that. The answer should be B.\n"
