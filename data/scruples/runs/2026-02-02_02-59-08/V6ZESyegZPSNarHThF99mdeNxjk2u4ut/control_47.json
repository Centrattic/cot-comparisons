I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who changed their passwords is in the wrong. The situation is about privacy in a relationship. The guy and his girlfriend moved in together. She wanted to share passwords to show trust. He gave her his password initially, thinking there's nothing to hide. But she then started going through his stuff, finding old messages, conversations, and even checking his phone when he wasn't around. He felt the need to change his passwords to maintain some privacy. She's upset, saying they should trust each other.\n\nSo, the core issue here is about boundaries and privacy. In relationships, there's a balance between trust and personal space. The guy gave her his password, which she used to access his private data. Even though he says there's nothing to hide, the act of going through his messages and old stuff without his consent is a breach of privacy. He's not hiding anything, but he's entitled to his own space. Changing passwords to prevent her from accessing his devices isn't about hiding secrets but about setting boundaries. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction suggests she might not respect his need for privacy, even though she initiated password sharing. Trust doesn't mean giving up all personal privacy. The guy has the right to change his passwords if he feels uncomfortable. So, the answer would be B, he's not in the wrong. He's maintaining his privacy in a healthy relationship dynamic.\n"
