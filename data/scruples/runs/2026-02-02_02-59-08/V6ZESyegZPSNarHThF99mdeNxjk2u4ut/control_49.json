I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for changing their passwords so their girlfriend can't access their devices anymore.\n\nFirst, the context: They moved in together, and the girlfriend wanted to share passwords as a sign of trust. The author gave her the password because they had nothing to hide. But then the girlfriend found old stuff like browser history, old messages, and even went through his phone, which embarrassed him. So he's changing the passwords again to protect his privacy, but she's upset because she thinks it's about trust.\n\nI need to evaluate if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about privacy versus trust in a relationship. The author is trying to maintain some personal space, which is understandable. On the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that the password sharing was a mutual agreement to show trust, and the author changing it back could be seen as breaking that trust.\n\nBut wait, the author initially gave the password because they had nothing to hide, but now they want privacy. That's a common dilemma. In many relationships, it's normal to have some level of privacy. The girlfriend's actions of going through his messages without asking might be an invasion of his privacy, which is why he's setting boundaries now.\n\nThe author's actions are about protecting their personal space, which is a valid need. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from feeling that the password sharing was a commitment to full transparency. However, the author has the right to adjust their privacy boundaries, especially if they feel uncomfortable. The fact that the author is not hiding anything but just wants to keep past, irrelevant data private is a good point in their favor.\n\nSo, considering that the girlfriend is the one accessing private conversations without permission, the author's decision to change passwords to prevent that is justified. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
