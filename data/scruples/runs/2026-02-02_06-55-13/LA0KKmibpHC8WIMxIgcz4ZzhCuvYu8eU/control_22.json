It\u2019s been over a year because we\u2019re not making enough to really be able to save up that much for a wedding.  Right now we have enough saved for just basic, barebones ceremonies.    I want our day to be special.  I want to remember it forever.  \n\nThere\u2019s this ugly, old car that sits in our garage.  He never even uses it.  It just takes up space.  It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That\u2019s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn\u2019t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It\u2019s ridiculous to me.  It\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he\u2019s not hearing me out at all.  He just gets mad every time I bring it up.  It\u2019s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?
