I told her I don't give her a free pass for this because to me it feels like cheating. After explaining that I would be broken if she would do it she told me she thinks it isn't cheating to her if you are on vacation and in another country because \"it is living in the moment\". At the end she told me she can't promise me anything and she is just gonna see there what see will do in the moment.\n\nPlease help me reddit, AITA because I've been feeling like it for the last few days\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",
