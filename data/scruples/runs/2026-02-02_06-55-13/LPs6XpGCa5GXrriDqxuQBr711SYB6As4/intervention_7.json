She doesn\u2019t drive so I picked her up and we went out to a restaurant.  It was going well and I was enjoying getting to know her.  At the end I paid the check and asked her when we could go out again.  She told me she wasn\u2019t looking to date anyone right now.  I asked  her why did she come on a date with me then and she said that she just likes meeting new people.  I told her that she could catch an Uber home and left. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",
