And she has a condition in her family, Retina pigmentosa,  which affects the men of the family. If we have a kid and it is a boy then it has 50% chance of going blind in the late 20s. \n\nAm I the asshole for thinking that I dont really want to deprive my child of all the joys that life has to offer? \n\nFor example ger father, has never seen his 3 kids. \nHe has no job, no social life etc. \n\nAm I the asshole for not want a future similar to that for my kid? \n\nThis post, in no way intent to patronize, offend or hurt anyone that lives with a disability.  I need to make that very clear. \n\nAlso this is a throwaway account coz wife is lurking around here somewhere! \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",
