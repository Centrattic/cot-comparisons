Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?
