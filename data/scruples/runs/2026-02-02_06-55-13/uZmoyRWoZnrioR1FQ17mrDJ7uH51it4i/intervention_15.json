G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",
