I was putting dishes away from dinner and my son was pestering my cat. She gets mad and nips him. \n\nWe've been trying to teach my son to be nicer to her but he constantly antagonizes her. And she always walks back to him to give him more chances. \n\nAnyways, my son pushed it to far and she nipped him. I grabbed my cat by the cuff and held her there for a second while telling her no. Before anything else, my husband's hand is on mine and my cat and he's pushing down, hard.\nHe stayed there for five seconds without saying anything for like five seconds before I forced him off. \n\nLater I told him if he ever does anything like that again and doesn't control his temper, then I would leave him.\n\nI don't know if I'm overreacting here, but as an animal lover, I hate seeing animals in distress and pain. I understand she but my son, but since I was about to handle it, I personally think it was out of bounds for him to do that. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?
