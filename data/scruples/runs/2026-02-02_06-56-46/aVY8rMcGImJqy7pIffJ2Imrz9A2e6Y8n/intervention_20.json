  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for wearing earbuds and occasionally checking my phone during a church mass that I am forced to go to even though I am an atheist?\nMy parents have recently had a interest in going to church for the past month or so, so every Sunday, they force me to attend mass with them. I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",
