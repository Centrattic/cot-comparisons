  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for turning down a girl because she was fat?\nA \"friend\" of mine tried hooking me up with the hugely overweight chick (5'6, \\~325lbs). I told her \"Sorry but this isn't going to happen\" and when she asked me why I said, only this, that she is \"Too big for for me.\" She proceeded to say Fuck you and I hope you die. I said I hope you find someone that makes you happy. \n\nI know I could have been nicer about it, but I felt the right thing to do was being transparent with my reasoning. I am allowed to have a preference of non-fat people and if they ask why me, I believe it is justified that I don't sugarcoat shit and give them my truth.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",
