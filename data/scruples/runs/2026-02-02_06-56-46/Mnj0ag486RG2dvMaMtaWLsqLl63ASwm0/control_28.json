I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?
