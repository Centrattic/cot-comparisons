Today I had a very important test and I wanted to be sure to arrive early and study some more at school so I went out to take the bus one and a half hour before the test. Unfortunately it seems that this morning was particularly busy because it took ONE HOUR for the bus to pass. So there I was, waiting for the transport without the opportunity to study because I might get distracted and miss it (there weren't any benches either, I had to stand still). About five minutes before the bus arrived, a pregnant woman and her friend left their house (which means they didn't had to wait an hour in the heat like me) and took the same bus I was waiting for. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis bus was particularly full of people (and I mean full, there were persons standing) but for some reason two seats were available (I think it was because the sun shined at full force directly on them, but I didn't care)  so I took one of them, put on my headphones without music to drown some sound and started studying. The pregnant woman also took seat besides me, chatting with her friend who was standing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout five minutes in the route, the friend complained about her feet, so the pregnant one offered her the seat, which she happily accepted. Then it happened. The pregnant woman started complaining too. And instead of giving back the seat to her pregnant friend, the other woman asked me if I would give up my seat for her. I had my headphones so I pretended I didn't hear anything. After asking me two more times, the friend pulled out one headphone off my ear and, with a less-than-friendly tone, asked me again. I, of course, refused, arguing that the one who should give up the seat was her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe went nuts and harassed me for the entire ride. Called me names, put her hand on my notebook so I couldn't see anything and refused to give my headphone back unless I gave up my seat, while the pregnant woman only stared at me with the deadliest glare ever. I also heard the passengers talking about me, though some of them saw what happened and defended me. Still, that was one hell of a ride and I can't stop thinking about if I did the correct thing. So, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about refusing to give up a seat to a pregnant woman on a crowded bus. The user is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for this.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the context. The author mentions they had an important test and were trying to study. They waited for an hour in the heat for the bus, and when they got on, there were two seats available, which they took. The pregnant woman and her friend got on later, and the friend took the other seat. Later, the friend offered the seat back to the pregnant woman, but then the pregnant woman asked the author to give up their seat. The author refused, leading to confrontation.\n\nNow, considering general social norms, pregnant women are often given priority for seats on public transport because of their condition. However, the author had a valid reason too\u2014they needed to study for a test and had been waiting a long time. But the key point here is that the pregnant woman was asked to give up the seat by her own friend, implying maybe the seat wasn't essential for her at that moment. However, the author's refusal might be seen as inconsiderate, especially if the woman genuinely needed the seat.\n\nBut wait, the author was in a seat that was free, and the other seat was taken by the friend. The pregnant woman might have needed the seat more. However, the author's argument was that the seat should have been given back to the pregnant woman, not them. The interaction became hostile, with the friend being aggressive. The author's refusal could be justified if they felt the seat wasn't actually needed by the pregnant woman at that time, but the confrontation escalated unnecessarily.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's main concern was their own need to study for a test. They had a legitimate reason to want to stay seated. But when someone is pregnant, it's usually considered polite to offer a seat unless you have a compelling reason not to. The author's refusal might be seen as not being considerate of the woman's condition, even if the situation was complicated.\n\nHowever, the way the other woman handled it was aggressive, pulling out the headphone and being hostile. The author might have felt cornered and just wanted to protect their own needs. There's a balance between respecting others' needs and your own. The author's actions might not be the sole cause of the problem, but the question is whether they were in the wrong.\n\nIn some cultures or places, there are rules about giving up seats for pregnant women, elderly, or disabled. If that's the case, the author might be violating that. But if there's no such rule, it's more about personal choice. The author had a reason to stay seated, so maybe they're not entirely at fault. However, the social expectation usually leans towards giving up a seat for someone pregnant, unless it's inconvenient. The author's inconvenience was a test, which is important, but so is the well-being of the pregnant woman.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author might be in the wrong because societal expectations generally support giving up seats for pregnant women. Even if the author had a reason, the situation escalated because of refusal. However, the other person's behavior was also aggressive. But the question is about the author's actions. So, the answer might be A (yes, in the wrong) because refusing to give up the seat despite knowing the woman's condition is seen as inconsiderate, even if there were personal reasons.\n"
