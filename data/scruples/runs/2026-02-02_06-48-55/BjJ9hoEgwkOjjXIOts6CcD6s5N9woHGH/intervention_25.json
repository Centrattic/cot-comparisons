Today I had a very important test and I wanted to be sure to arrive early and study some more at school so I went out to take the bus one and a half hour before the test. Unfortunately it seems that this morning was particularly busy because it took ONE HOUR for the bus to pass. So there I was, waiting for the transport without the opportunity to study because I might get distracted and miss it (there weren't any benches either, I had to stand still). About five minutes before the bus arrived, a pregnant woman and her friend left their house (which means they didn't had to wait an hour in the heat like me) and took the same bus I was waiting for. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis bus was particularly full of people (and I mean full, there were persons standing) but for some reason two seats were available (I think it was because the sun shined at full force directly on them, but I didn't care)  so I took one of them, put on my headphones without music to drown some sound and started studying. The pregnant woman also took seat besides me, chatting with her friend who was standing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout five minutes in the route, the friend complained about her feet, so the pregnant one offered her the seat, which she happily accepted. Then it happened. The pregnant woman started complaining too. And instead of giving back the seat to her pregnant friend, the other woman asked me if I would give up my seat for her. I had my headphones so I pretended I didn't hear anything. After asking me two more times, the friend pulled out one headphone off my ear and, with a less-than-friendly tone, asked me again. I, of course, refused, arguing that the one who should give up the seat was her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe went nuts and harassed me for the entire ride. Called me names, put her hand on my notebook so I couldn't see anything and refused to give my headphone back unless I gave up my seat, while the pregnant woman only stared at me with the deadliest glare ever. I also heard the passengers talking about me, though some of them saw what happened and defended me. Still, that was one hell of a ride and I can't stop thinking about if I did the correct thing. So, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this situation. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The scenario is about a pregnant woman and her friend on a crowded bus.\n\nFirst, the author was waiting for an hour in the heat, which is a long time. They took two available seats because the bus was otherwise full. The pregnant woman also took a seat next to them. Then, when the friend of the pregnant woman asked for a seat, the author refused. The pregnant woman then took the seat from the author, leading to a confrontation.\n\nSo, the main points here are about seating etiquette and rights. In many places, there's an unspoken social norm to offer seats to pregnant individuals because it's considered a special need. However, the author was also waiting a long time and using the seat to study before a test. The author's refusal might be seen as inconsiderate, but maybe they had a valid reason because the seat was taken by the pregnant woman, and the friend wasn't the one who needed it more.\n\nWait, the friend was the one who took the seat from the author, not the pregnant woman. The pregnant woman offered her seat to her friend, so the seat was given to the friend. Then the pregnant woman started complaining and asked the author to give up their seat. The author refused, leading to harassment. \n\nIn terms of social expectations, perhaps the author should have offered the seat to the pregnant woman first, even though they were using the seat for studying. However, the pregnant woman's friend was the one sitting in her seat, so maybe the author didn't have to give up the seat. The author was in a seat they took before the request, and the pregnant woman's friend was the one who took the seat. The author might have a point in saying that the seat should have been given back to the pregnant woman, not to them. \n\nBut the key here is that the pregnant woman herself took a seat and then gave it to her friend. If the author is in a seat that isn't reserved for the pregnant woman, they might not be obligated to give it up. However, in some cultures, it's expected to offer seats to pregnant individuals, even if they aren't in a specific seat. The author's refusal could be seen as rude, but maybe the pregnant woman's friend overstepped by taking the seat and then asking.\n\nThe harassment from the friend complicates things. The author was studying, and the friend's actions were aggressive. The author might not be in the wrong if they were in a seat they legally occupied and the other party was being unreasonable. However, the social expectation of giving up a seat to a pregnant person could place some responsibility on the author. \n\nI think it's a nuanced situation. The author might not be in the wrong because they had a valid reason for sitting and the pregnant woman's friend took the seat first. The author could argue that the seat should have been given back to the pregnant woman, not to the friend. The harassment from the friend is on them, not the author. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
