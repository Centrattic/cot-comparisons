Today I had a very important test and I wanted to be sure to arrive early and study some more at school so I went out to take the bus one and a half hour before the test. Unfortunately it seems that this morning was particularly busy because it took ONE HOUR for the bus to pass. So there I was, waiting for the transport without the opportunity to study because I might get distracted and miss it (there weren't any benches either, I had to stand still). About five minutes before the bus arrived, a pregnant woman and her friend left their house (which means they didn't had to wait an hour in the heat like me) and took the same bus I was waiting for. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis bus was particularly full of people (and I mean full, there were persons standing) but for some reason two seats were available (I think it was because the sun shined at full force directly on them, but I didn't care)  so I took one of them, put on my headphones without music to drown some sound and started studying. The pregnant woman also took seat besides me, chatting with her friend who was standing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout five minutes in the route, the friend complained about her feet, so the pregnant one offered her the seat, which she happily accepted. Then it happened. The pregnant woman started complaining too. And instead of giving back the seat to her pregnant friend, the other woman asked me if I would give up my seat for her. I had my headphones so I pretended I didn't hear anything. After asking me two more times, the friend pulled out one headphone off my ear and, with a less-than-friendly tone, asked me again. I, of course, refused, arguing that the one who should give up the seat was her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe went nuts and harassed me for the entire ride. Called me names, put her hand on my notebook so I couldn't see anything and refused to give my headphone back unless I gave up my seat, while the pregnant woman only stared at me with the deadliest glare ever. I also heard the passengers talking about me, though some of them saw what happened and defended me. Still, that was one hell of a ride and I can't stop thinking about if I did the correct thing. So, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author did the wrong thing here. So, the situation is about refusing to give up a seat on a crowded bus to a pregnant woman. The author was waiting for over an hour, had an important test, and found two seats available due to the sun. They started studying, then the pregnant woman sat next to them. Her friend took the other seat after the pregnant woman offered it. Then the pregnant woman complained and asked the author to give up their seat. The author refused, and things escalated.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The bus was full, but there were two seats available. The author took one to study for their test. The pregnant woman and her friend arrived later, and the friend took the other seat. The author didn't ask for the seat; they took it because it was available. The pregnant woman then asked the author, not the friend who had the seat, to give up their seat. The author refused, which led to harassment.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, there might be an expectation to give up a seat for someone who is pregnant, as they might have medical reasons to need a seat. However, the author had a valid reason too\u2014preparing for a test and waiting a long time. The key point here is that there were two seats. The friend of the pregnant woman took one seat, so the author had a right to the other. When the pregnant woman asked the author to give up the seat, it's possible that the friend should have given theirs up instead. The author's refusal might be justified because they had a legitimate reason to be seated. The harassment from the other woman seems unfair, especially since there were other options. The passengers who defended the author also suggest that the situation wasn't entirely one-sided. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong here. They had their reasons and the seat wasn't necessarily required by the pregnant woman if her friend already had one.\n"
