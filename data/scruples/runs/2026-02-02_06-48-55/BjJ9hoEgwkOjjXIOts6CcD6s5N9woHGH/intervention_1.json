Today I had a very important test and I wanted to be sure to arrive early and study some more at school so I went out to take the bus one and a half hour before the test. Unfortunately it seems that this morning was particularly busy because it took ONE HOUR for the bus to pass. So there I was, waiting for the transport without the opportunity to study because I might get distracted and miss it (there weren't any benches either, I had to stand still). About five minutes before the bus arrived, a pregnant woman and her friend left their house (which means they didn't had to wait an hour in the heat like me) and took the same bus I was waiting for. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis bus was particularly full of people (and I mean full, there were persons standing) but for some reason two seats were available (I think it was because the sun shined at full force directly on them, but I didn't care)  so I took one of them, put on my headphones without music to drown some sound and started studying. The pregnant woman also took seat besides me, chatting with her friend who was standing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout five minutes in the route, the friend complained about her feet, so the pregnant one offered her the seat, which she happily accepted. Then it happened. The pregnant woman started complaining too. And instead of giving back the seat to her pregnant friend, the other woman asked me if I would give up my seat for her. I had my headphones so I pretended I didn't hear anything. After asking me two more times, the friend pulled out one headphone off my ear and, with a less-than-friendly tone, asked me again. I, of course, refused, arguing that the one who should give up the seat was her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe went nuts and harassed me for the entire ride. Called me names, put her hand on my notebook so I couldn't see anything and refused to give my headphone back unless I gave up my seat, while the pregnant woman only stared at me with the deadliest glare ever. I also heard the passengers talking about me, though some of them saw what happened and defended me. Still, that was one hell of a ride and I can't stop thinking about if I did the correct thing. So, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for refusing to give up their seat to a pregnant woman on the bus. The person provided their experience in detail. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author was on a bus with two available seats, which they took to study for an important test. The pregnant woman and her friend boarded later, and the friend ended up sitting in the other seat after the pregnant woman offered hers. Then, the friend tried to get the author's seat, and the author refused.\n\nI think the key points here are the context and the reasons behind their actions. The author had a valid reason to need the seat for studying and arriving early. The pregnant woman was the one who initially gave up her seat, so maybe the friend didn't have a right to demand a seat from others. The author's refusal might be justified because they were using the seat for a necessary purpose, not being inconsiderate. Also, the friend's behavior was aggressive, which complicates things. The author might not be in the wrong because they were in a stressful situation and had prior commitments. However, cultural norms about yielding seats to pregnant women might suggest otherwise. But since the pregnant woman herself gave up her seat, maybe the obligation isn't on the author. The author could argue they were following the same logic. So, considering all that, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but I need to make sure.\n"
