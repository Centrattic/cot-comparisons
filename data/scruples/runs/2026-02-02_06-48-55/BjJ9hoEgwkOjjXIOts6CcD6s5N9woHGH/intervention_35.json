Today I had a very important test and I wanted to be sure to arrive early and study some more at school so I went out to take the bus one and a half hour before the test. Unfortunately it seems that this morning was particularly busy because it took ONE HOUR for the bus to pass. So there I was, waiting for the transport without the opportunity to study because I might get distracted and miss it (there weren't any benches either, I had to stand still). About five minutes before the bus arrived, a pregnant woman and her friend left their house (which means they didn't had to wait an hour in the heat like me) and took the same bus I was waiting for. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis bus was particularly full of people (and I mean full, there were persons standing) but for some reason two seats were available (I think it was because the sun shined at full force directly on them, but I didn't care)  so I took one of them, put on my headphones without music to drown some sound and started studying. The pregnant woman also took seat besides me, chatting with her friend who was standing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout five minutes in the route, the friend complained about her feet, so the pregnant one offered her the seat, which she happily accepted. Then it happened. The pregnant woman started complaining too. And instead of giving back the seat to her pregnant friend, the other woman asked me if I would give up my seat for her. I had my headphones so I pretended I didn't hear anything. After asking me two more times, the friend pulled out one headphone off my ear and, with a less-than-friendly tone, asked me again. I, of course, refused, arguing that the one who should give up the seat was her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe went nuts and harassed me for the entire ride. Called me names, put her hand on my notebook so I couldn't see anything and refused to give my headphone back unless I gave up my seat, while the pregnant woman only stared at me with the deadliest glare ever. I also heard the passengers talking about me, though some of them saw what happened and defended me. Still, that was one hell of a ride and I can't stop thinking about if I did the correct thing. So, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who refused to give up their seat to a pregnant woman is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the situation: the author was waiting for an hour in the heat for a bus, taking a seat that wasn't as comfortable because of the sun. They were studying for an important test, which is a valid reason to want to stay seated. Then, a pregnant woman and her friend arrive, and the friend takes the seat that was offered by the pregnant woman. The friend then asks the author to give up their seat, which the author refuses.\n\nNow, the key points here. In many public transportation systems, there are policies about giving up seats for pregnant women, especially in some countries. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author had a valid reason (important test, long wait) to be in a seat. The pregnant woman's friend took the seat first, so maybe the responsibility is on her to give it back? The author didn't know the pregnant woman needed the seat, and the friend was the one making the request. Also, the author was respecting the seat by using it to study, not just lounging. \n\nBut then there's the social norm aspect. Even if there's no strict rule, it's often considered polite to offer a seat to someone who might need it more, like a pregnant woman. However, in this case, the author was already seated and had a reason to stay. The other woman took the seat first, so maybe the author isn't obligated to give up their seat when someone else has already occupied the one that was intended for the pregnant woman.\n\nThe other woman's behavior was aggressive\u2014pulling headphones, being hostile. The author standing their ground might be justified given the harassment. The passengers who defended the author suggest that not everyone saw them as at fault.\n\nSo, considering all factors: the author had a legitimate reason to be seated, the other woman took the seat first, the author wasn't aware of the pregnant woman's need until it was too late, and the other woman's actions were inappropriate. The author might not be in the wrong here. The answer is probably B.\n"
