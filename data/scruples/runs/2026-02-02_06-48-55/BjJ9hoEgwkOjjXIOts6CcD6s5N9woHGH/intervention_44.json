Today I had a very important test and I wanted to be sure to arrive early and study some more at school so I went out to take the bus one and a half hour before the test. Unfortunately it seems that this morning was particularly busy because it took ONE HOUR for the bus to pass. So there I was, waiting for the transport without the opportunity to study because I might get distracted and miss it (there weren't any benches either, I had to stand still). About five minutes before the bus arrived, a pregnant woman and her friend left their house (which means they didn't had to wait an hour in the heat like me) and took the same bus I was waiting for. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis bus was particularly full of people (and I mean full, there were persons standing) but for some reason two seats were available (I think it was because the sun shined at full force directly on them, but I didn't care)  so I took one of them, put on my headphones without music to drown some sound and started studying. The pregnant woman also took seat besides me, chatting with her friend who was standing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout five minutes in the route, the friend complained about her feet, so the pregnant one offered her the seat, which she happily accepted. Then it happened. The pregnant woman started complaining too. And instead of giving back the seat to her pregnant friend, the other woman asked me if I would give up my seat for her. I had my headphones so I pretended I didn't hear anything. After asking me two more times, the friend pulled out one headphone off my ear and, with a less-than-friendly tone, asked me again. I, of course, refused, arguing that the one who should give up the seat was her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe went nuts and harassed me for the entire ride. Called me names, put her hand on my notebook so I couldn't see anything and refused to give my headphone back unless I gave up my seat, while the pregnant woman only stared at me with the deadliest glare ever. I also heard the passengers talking about me, though some of them saw what happened and defended me. Still, that was one hell of a ride and I can't stop thinking about if I did the correct thing. So, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about refusing to give up a seat on a crowded bus to a pregnant woman. The author was already waiting for a long time, took a seat because there were only two available, and started studying. Then a pregnant woman and her friend came in, and the friend took the seat the pregnant woman offered. The friend then asked the author for the seat, and the author refused, leading to some conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the usual norms around giving up seats. In many places, there's an unspoken rule to offer seats to pregnant women, elderly, or those with disabilities. However, there might be exceptions if the person has been standing for a long time or has a valid reason. The author mentions they had an important test and needed to study, so maybe their refusal is understandable from their perspective.\n\nBut the key point here is that the author had a seat, and the pregnant woman had already given her seat to her friend. The friend was the one asking for the seat, not the pregnant woman herself. The author didn't have an obligation to give up their seat to someone who wasn't as obviously in need (since the friend was standing and the pregnant woman was sitting). Also, the author was using the seat to study and had already endured the long wait. \n\nThe other passengers' reactions were mixed, with some defending the author. The pregnant woman's friend was being aggressive, maybe overstepping by taking the author's seat. The author's refusal might be justified because the seat wasn't being given to the pregnant woman herself, but to her friend who had already taken the seat offered by the pregnant woman. So, the author might not be in the wrong, as they were protecting their own need to study and the seat was already their right to use given the circumstances. \n\nHowever, there's the social expectation to be considerate. But if the pregnant woman herself didn't ask for the seat, maybe the author's refusal is acceptable. The main issue is that the author didn't give up the seat, but the context (long wait, important test) might mitigate their responsibility. So, maybe the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
