Today I had a very important test and I wanted to be sure to arrive early and study some more at school so I went out to take the bus one and a half hour before the test. Unfortunately it seems that this morning was particularly busy because it took ONE HOUR for the bus to pass. So there I was, waiting for the transport without the opportunity to study because I might get distracted and miss it (there weren't any benches either, I had to stand still). About five minutes before the bus arrived, a pregnant woman and her friend left their house (which means they didn't had to wait an hour in the heat like me) and took the same bus I was waiting for. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis bus was particularly full of people (and I mean full, there were persons standing) but for some reason two seats were available (I think it was because the sun shined at full force directly on them, but I didn't care)  so I took one of them, put on my headphones without music to drown some sound and started studying. The pregnant woman also took seat besides me, chatting with her friend who was standing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout five minutes in the route, the friend complained about her feet, so the pregnant one offered her the seat, which she happily accepted. Then it happened. The pregnant woman started complaining too. And instead of giving back the seat to her pregnant friend, the other woman asked me if I would give up my seat for her. I had my headphones so I pretended I didn't hear anything. After asking me two more times, the friend pulled out one headphone off my ear and, with a less-than-friendly tone, asked me again. I, of course, refused, arguing that the one who should give up the seat was her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe went nuts and harassed me for the entire ride. Called me names, put her hand on my notebook so I couldn't see anything and refused to give my headphone back unless I gave up my seat, while the pregnant woman only stared at me with the deadliest glare ever. I also heard the passengers talking about me, though some of them saw what happened and defended me. Still, that was one hell of a ride and I can't stop thinking about if I did the correct thing. So, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for refusing to give up their seat to a pregnant woman on a crowded bus. The author was waiting for a long time, had an important test, and took a seat that was available. When the pregnant woman and her friend boarded, there were two seats left. The pregnant woman sat next to the author. Then, the friend took the seat from the pregnant woman after she offered it. The friend then asked the author to give up their seat, and when the author refused, there was a confrontation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the societal norms around giving up seats to pregnant women. Generally, people are encouraged to offer seats to those who might need it, like pregnant individuals, the elderly, or people with disabilities. However, that's a social expectation, not a legal requirement. The author was in a seat they had taken before the pregnant woman arrived. The key point here is whether the author had a prior obligation to give up their seat.\n\nThe bus was full, but there were two seats. The author took one, the pregnant woman took the other. Then, the friend took the pregnant woman's seat. The author's refusal to give up their seat to the pregnant woman is the crux of the situation. The author was studying for an important test, which adds context to their urgency. However, the pregnant woman was also present, but she allowed her friend to take her seat first. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the social norm is to offer seats to pregnant women. On the other hand, the seat the author was in was originally taken by the pregnant woman, but she gave it to her friend. The author might not have an obligation if the seat was already given up by the pregnant woman. However, the friend then asked the author to give up their seat, which the author refused. \n\nBut the pregnant woman was still there, so maybe there's an expectation to offer the seat to her. However, she didn't ask, her friend did. The author's refusal could be seen as not adhering to social norms, but given the circumstances\u2014waiting for a long time, needing to study\u2014it's a gray area. \n\nAnother angle is that the author was in a seat they had a right to take, and the pregnant woman's friend was the one who took her seat. The author isn't necessarily at fault for not giving up their seat, especially if the seat was not specifically reserved for her. The situation might be more about the friend's behavior than the author's decision. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be in the wrong because they had a right to the seat they were in, and the request came from the friend, not the pregnant woman herself. Plus, the author was in a time-sensitive situation. However, from a social etiquette standpoint, offering a seat could be expected. But since the pregnant woman didn't ask and the seat was already given up by her, the author's refusal isn't necessarily wrong.\n"
