Today I had a very important test and I wanted to be sure to arrive early and study some more at school so I went out to take the bus one and a half hour before the test. Unfortunately it seems that this morning was particularly busy because it took ONE HOUR for the bus to pass. So there I was, waiting for the transport without the opportunity to study because I might get distracted and miss it (there weren't any benches either, I had to stand still). About five minutes before the bus arrived, a pregnant woman and her friend left their house (which means they didn't had to wait an hour in the heat like me) and took the same bus I was waiting for. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis bus was particularly full of people (and I mean full, there were persons standing) but for some reason two seats were available (I think it was because the sun shined at full force directly on them, but I didn't care)  so I took one of them, put on my headphones without music to drown some sound and started studying. The pregnant woman also took seat besides me, chatting with her friend who was standing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout five minutes in the route, the friend complained about her feet, so the pregnant one offered her the seat, which she happily accepted. Then it happened. The pregnant woman started complaining too. And instead of giving back the seat to her pregnant friend, the other woman asked me if I would give up my seat for her. I had my headphones so I pretended I didn't hear anything. After asking me two more times, the friend pulled out one headphone off my ear and, with a less-than-friendly tone, asked me again. I, of course, refused, arguing that the one who should give up the seat was her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe went nuts and harassed me for the entire ride. Called me names, put her hand on my notebook so I couldn't see anything and refused to give my headphone back unless I gave up my seat, while the pregnant woman only stared at me with the deadliest glare ever. I also heard the passengers talking about me, though some of them saw what happened and defended me. Still, that was one hell of a ride and I can't stop thinking about if I did the correct thing. So, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for refusing to give up their seat to a pregnant woman on a crowded bus.\n\nFirst, the context: The person was waiting for a bus for over an hour, standing because there were no benches. They managed to get a seat because two were available, possibly due to the sun. They were using the time to study for an important test. Then, a pregnant woman and her friend arrived, took the same bus, and the pregnant woman sat next to the person. The friend of the pregnant woman took the seat from the pregnant woman, then asked the author to give up their seat. The author refused, leading to harassment and conflict.\n\nSo, the key points here are about the responsibility to yield a seat. In many places, there are laws or social norms that prioritize seating for pregnant women, elderly, disabled, etc. However, the situation is complicated here because the pregnant woman had already given her seat to her friend. The friend then asked the author for the seat. The author's defense is that the seat should have been given back to the pregnant woman by her friend, not to them.\n\nBut from a legal and social standpoint, if the pregnant woman was seated and then gave her seat to her friend, maybe the friend is the one who should have given it back. However, the friend asked the author instead. The author's refusal might be seen as inconsiderate, but they had their own reason\u2014studying for an important test and using the seat they had. However, social norms often prioritize pregnant women, so even if the seat was given to the friend, the author might still be expected to offer it to the pregnant woman.\n\nBut wait, the friend was the one who initially took the seat, so maybe the author isn't obligated to give up their seat unless the pregnant woman is in obvious distress. The author was using the seat and had a valid reason (studying for a test). The harassment from the friend complicates things. If the friend was being aggressive and the author felt harassed, their refusal might be justified. However, the initial act of not giving up the seat to the pregnant woman could be seen as wrong, especially if the pregnant woman was clearly in need.\n\nBut the key detail is that the pregnant woman had already given her seat to her friend. So the seat wasn't hers anymore in that moment. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong for refusing to give up a seat that the friend had taken. The author's refusal is directed at the friend, not the pregnant woman herself. However, if the pregnant woman was visibly uncomfortable, maybe the author should have offered the seat to her directly, regardless of the friend's actions. But since the friend was the one asking, maybe the author's refusal is not their fault.\n\nIn terms of etiquette, it's often considered polite to offer a seat to someone in need, even if it's not legally enforced. But if the author was using the seat and had a reason (studying), maybe it's a grey area. The harassment by the friend is definitely not okay, but the author's refusal to give up their seat might not make them the asshole if the seat was already given to the friend. \n\nOn the other hand, the pregnant woman might still be entitled to the seat, even if she gave it to her friend. So if the friend took the seat, the author could argue that the friend should give it back to the pregnant woman, not the author. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for refusing to give up their seat. They were in a seat that was available, using it for a valid purpose, and the friend was being inconsiderate.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer is probably B (the author is not in the wrong). They were in a seat they had a right to take, the friend's actions were inappropriate, and the author's refusal was justified given the circumstances.\n"
