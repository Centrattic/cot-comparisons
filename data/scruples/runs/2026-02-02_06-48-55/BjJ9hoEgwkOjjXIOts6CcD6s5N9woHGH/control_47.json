Today I had a very important test and I wanted to be sure to arrive early and study some more at school so I went out to take the bus one and a half hour before the test. Unfortunately it seems that this morning was particularly busy because it took ONE HOUR for the bus to pass. So there I was, waiting for the transport without the opportunity to study because I might get distracted and miss it (there weren't any benches either, I had to stand still). About five minutes before the bus arrived, a pregnant woman and her friend left their house (which means they didn't had to wait an hour in the heat like me) and took the same bus I was waiting for. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis bus was particularly full of people (and I mean full, there were persons standing) but for some reason two seats were available (I think it was because the sun shined at full force directly on them, but I didn't care)  so I took one of them, put on my headphones without music to drown some sound and started studying. The pregnant woman also took seat besides me, chatting with her friend who was standing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout five minutes in the route, the friend complained about her feet, so the pregnant one offered her the seat, which she happily accepted. Then it happened. The pregnant woman started complaining too. And instead of giving back the seat to her pregnant friend, the other woman asked me if I would give up my seat for her. I had my headphones so I pretended I didn't hear anything. After asking me two more times, the friend pulled out one headphone off my ear and, with a less-than-friendly tone, asked me again. I, of course, refused, arguing that the one who should give up the seat was her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe went nuts and harassed me for the entire ride. Called me names, put her hand on my notebook so I couldn't see anything and refused to give my headphone back unless I gave up my seat, while the pregnant woman only stared at me with the deadliest glare ever. I also heard the passengers talking about me, though some of them saw what happened and defended me. Still, that was one hell of a ride and I can't stop thinking about if I did the correct thing. So, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about refusing to give up a seat to a pregnant woman on a crowded bus. The author was waiting for a long time, had an important test, and took one of the available seats. Then the pregnant woman and her friend came later, the friend took the seat offered by the pregnant woman, and then asked the author for the seat. The author refused, leading to some conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the context. The author had an important test and was trying to study. They were waiting for an hour in the heat without benches. The bus was full, and there were only two seats left. The author took one of those seats. The pregnant woman took the other seat. Then her friend took her seat, and then asked the author for theirs. The author refused, which led to harassment.\n\nNow, in many places, there are laws or social norms about giving up seats to pregnant women or people with special needs. So, the question is whether the author violated that. But the author's defense is that the person asking for the seat was not the pregnant woman herself, but her friend, who had just taken the seat offered by the pregnant woman. The author might argue that it's the friend, not the pregnant woman, who needs the seat now. Also, the author was in a situation where they needed to study for a test and had already waited a long time.\n\nBut on the other hand, maybe the social expectation is that you should give up your seat to someone who is pregnant, regardless of who is asking. So even if the friend was the one asking, maybe the author should have given up the seat for the pregnant woman's comfort. However, the author points out that the pregnant woman didn't ask for her own seat; her friend did. The author might feel that it's not their responsibility to give up a seat if the pregnant woman isn't the one requesting it.\n\nAlso, the friend was the one who took the pregnant woman's seat. So the author is pointing out that the person sitting should be the one to give up the seat, not the author. The author might feel that the friend should give back the seat to the pregnant woman instead of taking the author's seat. But the friend didn't do that and instead asked the author for their seat.\n\nThe harassment the author faced seems excessive. The friend pulled off their headphone and was hostile. The author was just trying to study. The passengers defending them might suggest that the situation wasn't entirely the author's fault.\n\nSo, considering all that, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they had a valid reason to take the seat, especially after waiting so long. The friend's actions might be the main issue here, not the author's refusal. The author could argue that they were protecting their right to the seat since the pregnant woman wasn't the one asking for it, and the friend had already taken a seat. Therefore, the author's refusal is justified.\n"
