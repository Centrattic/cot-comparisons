Today I had a very important test and I wanted to be sure to arrive early and study some more at school so I went out to take the bus one and a half hour before the test. Unfortunately it seems that this morning was particularly busy because it took ONE HOUR for the bus to pass. So there I was, waiting for the transport without the opportunity to study because I might get distracted and miss it (there weren't any benches either, I had to stand still). About five minutes before the bus arrived, a pregnant woman and her friend left their house (which means they didn't had to wait an hour in the heat like me) and took the same bus I was waiting for. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis bus was particularly full of people (and I mean full, there were persons standing) but for some reason two seats were available (I think it was because the sun shined at full force directly on them, but I didn't care)  so I took one of them, put on my headphones without music to drown some sound and started studying. The pregnant woman also took seat besides me, chatting with her friend who was standing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout five minutes in the route, the friend complained about her feet, so the pregnant one offered her the seat, which she happily accepted. Then it happened. The pregnant woman started complaining too. And instead of giving back the seat to her pregnant friend, the other woman asked me if I would give up my seat for her. I had my headphones so I pretended I didn't hear anything. After asking me two more times, the friend pulled out one headphone off my ear and, with a less-than-friendly tone, asked me again. I, of course, refused, arguing that the one who should give up the seat was her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe went nuts and harassed me for the entire ride. Called me names, put her hand on my notebook so I couldn't see anything and refused to give my headphone back unless I gave up my seat, while the pregnant woman only stared at me with the deadliest glare ever. I also heard the passengers talking about me, though some of them saw what happened and defended me. Still, that was one hell of a ride and I can't stop thinking about if I did the correct thing. So, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about refusing to give up a seat to a pregnant woman on a crowded bus. The author was waiting for over an hour in the heat and took one of the two available seats. The pregnant woman and her friend arrived later, and the seat next to the author was taken by her friend. Then the pregnant woman offered her seat to her friend, who took it. The friend then asked the author to give up their seat, which the author refused. \n\nHmm, first, I need to consider the rules and etiquette around public transportation. In many places, there are guidelines encouraging people to give up seats to those with greater need, like pregnant individuals, elderly, or disabled. But the author had been waiting a long time and needed to study. However, once the seat was taken by the pregnant woman's friend, maybe the author's situation was less urgent compared to the pregnant woman who had already given up her seat for her friend.\n\nWait, the friend took the seat from the pregnant woman, so maybe the author's refusal to give up the seat to the pregnant woman, who had already given her seat to her friend, is an issue. The author was the one who had a seat, and the pregnant woman was now standing. But the author was using the seat for studying, which is understandable, but perhaps not a valid reason compared to someone who is pregnant and might need to sit for health reasons.\n\nAlso, the other passengers had mixed reactions. Some defended the author, which might suggest that the author's action isn't universally seen as wrong. However, the pregnant woman's health and comfort could be a stronger factor. The author was being asked to give up their seat, but if the pregnant woman is standing, maybe the author should have offered the seat for health reasons.\n\nBut the author had been waiting a long time and was using the seat to prepare for an important test. That's a valid personal need too. However, public transportation etiquette often prioritizes those with greater physical needs. So even if the author had a reason to sit, the pregnant woman's need might be more pressing. Also, the author didn't give back the seat when the pregnant woman was standing, which could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nThe other woman's behavior was pushy, but the author's refusal to comply might have escalated the situation. However, the author might have had the right to refuse, especially if they were using the seat for a valid reason. But in many cultures, giving up a seat for a pregnant person is considered a basic courtesy, even if you're also in a hurry or have your own reasons.\n\nI'm a bit torn here. On one hand, the author had legitimate reasons for sitting and studying. On the other hand, the pregnant woman might have a greater need to sit, especially if she's in her later stages of pregnancy. The fact that the author's seat was taken by the friend, and then the pregnant woman was left standing, might mean that the author should have offered their seat to her. So maybe the author is in the wrong because they prioritized their own needs over someone who might have a medical or physical need to sit. The author's refusal could be seen as inconsiderate, even if their own situation was also challenging.\n"
