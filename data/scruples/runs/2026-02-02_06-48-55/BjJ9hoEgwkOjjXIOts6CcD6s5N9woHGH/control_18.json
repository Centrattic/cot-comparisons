Today I had a very important test and I wanted to be sure to arrive early and study some more at school so I went out to take the bus one and a half hour before the test. Unfortunately it seems that this morning was particularly busy because it took ONE HOUR for the bus to pass. So there I was, waiting for the transport without the opportunity to study because I might get distracted and miss it (there weren't any benches either, I had to stand still). About five minutes before the bus arrived, a pregnant woman and her friend left their house (which means they didn't had to wait an hour in the heat like me) and took the same bus I was waiting for. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis bus was particularly full of people (and I mean full, there were persons standing) but for some reason two seats were available (I think it was because the sun shined at full force directly on them, but I didn't care)  so I took one of them, put on my headphones without music to drown some sound and started studying. The pregnant woman also took seat besides me, chatting with her friend who was standing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout five minutes in the route, the friend complained about her feet, so the pregnant one offered her the seat, which she happily accepted. Then it happened. The pregnant woman started complaining too. And instead of giving back the seat to her pregnant friend, the other woman asked me if I would give up my seat for her. I had my headphones so I pretended I didn't hear anything. After asking me two more times, the friend pulled out one headphone off my ear and, with a less-than-friendly tone, asked me again. I, of course, refused, arguing that the one who should give up the seat was her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe went nuts and harassed me for the entire ride. Called me names, put her hand on my notebook so I couldn't see anything and refused to give my headphone back unless I gave up my seat, while the pregnant woman only stared at me with the deadliest glare ever. I also heard the passengers talking about me, though some of them saw what happened and defended me. Still, that was one hell of a ride and I can't stop thinking about if I did the correct thing. So, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person asking (AITA) is in the wrong here. Let me break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the user was waiting for a bus for an hour and a half because it was delayed. They were going to an important test and needed to study. When the bus finally arrived, there were two seats available, probably because of the sun, but the user took one. They put on headphones and started studying. A pregnant woman and her friend got on and the pregnant woman sat next to the user. Then, the friend complained about her feet and the pregnant woman offered her the seat. The friend took the seat, and then the pregnant woman started complaining too. Instead of giving back the seat, the friend asked the user to give up theirs. The user refused, and the situation escalated with harassment.\n\nNow, the key points here are: the user had a valid reason to be on the bus early for their test, the seats were available when the bus was full, and the user was using the seat to study. The pregnant woman initially gave up her seat to her friend, so maybe the seat wasn't technically reserved for her anymore. The user might not have known that in some places, pregnant women have priority for seats, but the friend took the seat first. The user refused when asked, but the friend was being aggressive. The user's refusal could be seen as justified if they were using the seat for a legitimate purpose (studying for an important test) and if the pregnant woman wasn't the one sitting in the seat. However, cultural norms might prioritize pregnant women, but in this case, she had given up her seat to her friend. So maybe the user isn't in the wrong because the seat wasn't specifically reserved for the pregnant woman anymore. The friend's actions seemed to overstep, and the user was defending their right to use the seat they had taken. Therefore, the answer might be B (No).\n"
