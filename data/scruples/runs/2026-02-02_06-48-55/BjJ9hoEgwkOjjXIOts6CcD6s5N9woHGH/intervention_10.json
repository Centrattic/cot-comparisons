Today I had a very important test and I wanted to be sure to arrive early and study some more at school so I went out to take the bus one and a half hour before the test. Unfortunately it seems that this morning was particularly busy because it took ONE HOUR for the bus to pass. So there I was, waiting for the transport without the opportunity to study because I might get distracted and miss it (there weren't any benches either, I had to stand still). About five minutes before the bus arrived, a pregnant woman and her friend left their house (which means they didn't had to wait an hour in the heat like me) and took the same bus I was waiting for. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis bus was particularly full of people (and I mean full, there were persons standing) but for some reason two seats were available (I think it was because the sun shined at full force directly on them, but I didn't care)  so I took one of them, put on my headphones without music to drown some sound and started studying. The pregnant woman also took seat besides me, chatting with her friend who was standing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout five minutes in the route, the friend complained about her feet, so the pregnant one offered her the seat, which she happily accepted. Then it happened. The pregnant woman started complaining too. And instead of giving back the seat to her pregnant friend, the other woman asked me if I would give up my seat for her. I had my headphones so I pretended I didn't hear anything. After asking me two more times, the friend pulled out one headphone off my ear and, with a less-than-friendly tone, asked me again. I, of course, refused, arguing that the one who should give up the seat was her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe went nuts and harassed me for the entire ride. Called me names, put her hand on my notebook so I couldn't see anything and refused to give my headphone back unless I gave up my seat, while the pregnant woman only stared at me with the deadliest glare ever. I also heard the passengers talking about me, though some of them saw what happened and defended me. Still, that was one hell of a ride and I can't stop thinking about if I did the correct thing. So, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're the asshole for not giving up their seat to a pregnant woman on a crowded bus. \n\nFirst, the context: They were waiting for a long time, stood in the heat, and took one of two available seats. The pregnant woman and her friend arrived later, and the pregnant woman sat next to them. Then her friend took the seat from the pregnant woman. The friend then asked the author to give up their seat, which they refused.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author was in the wrong. In many places, there are laws or etiquette about giving up seats to pregnant women, elderly, or disabled. But the situation here is a bit complicated. The author had a valid reason to want to study for a test and arrive early. However, when the seat was offered to the friend, maybe the author should have given up their seat to the pregnant woman instead? \n\nBut wait, the friend took the seat from the pregnant woman first. The author was sitting in another seat. The pregnant woman had a seat but gave it to her friend. So maybe the author didn't have to give up their seat since the pregnant woman already had a seat? But then the friend took it, and the author was in the other seat. \n\nThe key point is whether the author should have given up their seat to the pregnant woman when asked. If the pregnant woman was in need, even if she gave her seat to her friend, maybe the author should have offered. But the author was using the seat for studying, which is important for their test. However, social norms often prioritize helping those with more need, like pregnant women, even if it's inconvenient. \n\nOn the other hand, the author was in a seat they took first, and the pregnant woman gave her seat away. The friend then took it, so the author might not be obligated to give up their seat. The harassment from the other woman complicates things. But if the author refused politely, maybe they're not in the wrong. However, the act of refusing to give up a seat to a pregnant woman could be seen as inconsiderate, hence AITA. \n\nI think the author might not be in the wrong because the pregnant woman already had a seat and gave it to her friend. The author was in a seat they had first, and the friend then took the pregnant woman's seat. So there's no obligation for the author to give up their seat. Plus, the harassment was unwarranted. So the answer is B.\n"
