Today I had a very important test and I wanted to be sure to arrive early and study some more at school so I went out to take the bus one and a half hour before the test. Unfortunately it seems that this morning was particularly busy because it took ONE HOUR for the bus to pass. So there I was, waiting for the transport without the opportunity to study because I might get distracted and miss it (there weren't any benches either, I had to stand still). About five minutes before the bus arrived, a pregnant woman and her friend left their house (which means they didn't had to wait an hour in the heat like me) and took the same bus I was waiting for. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis bus was particularly full of people (and I mean full, there were persons standing) but for some reason two seats were available (I think it was because the sun shined at full force directly on them, but I didn't care)  so I took one of them, put on my headphones without music to drown some sound and started studying. The pregnant woman also took seat besides me, chatting with her friend who was standing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout five minutes in the route, the friend complained about her feet, so the pregnant one offered her the seat, which she happily accepted. Then it happened. The pregnant woman started complaining too. And instead of giving back the seat to her pregnant friend, the other woman asked me if I would give up my seat for her. I had my headphones so I pretended I didn't hear anything. After asking me two more times, the friend pulled out one headphone off my ear and, with a less-than-friendly tone, asked me again. I, of course, refused, arguing that the one who should give up the seat was her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe went nuts and harassed me for the entire ride. Called me names, put her hand on my notebook so I couldn't see anything and refused to give my headphone back unless I gave up my seat, while the pregnant woman only stared at me with the deadliest glare ever. I also heard the passengers talking about me, though some of them saw what happened and defended me. Still, that was one hell of a ride and I can't stop thinking about if I did the correct thing. So, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about refusing to give up a seat to a pregnant woman on a crowded bus. The user is asking if they're the asshole (AITA).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was waiting for over an hour in the heat for the bus, which was already full. There were only two seats available, probably because of direct sunlight. The author took one seat to study for an important test. Then, a pregnant woman and her friend arrived just before the bus came, didn't wait in the heat, and boarded. The pregnant woman sat next to the author, and her friend stood. On the bus, the friend complained about her feet, so the pregnant woman offered her a seat. The friend took the seat, leaving the pregnant woman with no seat. Then, the friend approached the author to give up their seat for the pregnant woman. The author refused, leading to harassment and confrontation.\n\nHmm, the key points here are: the pregnant woman initially had a seat, gave it to her friend, then the author was asked to give theirs up. The author was using the seat to study and had been waiting a long time. The friend of the pregnant woman took the author's seat, so maybe the author was right to point out that she should have given hers back. The pregnant woman didn't ask directly; her friend did. The author was in a seat because there were only two available, and the friend took the other seat, which might have been the pregnant woman's original seat. The author's refusal was based on the fact that the person actually needing the seat was the one who should return it, not the author. Also, the harassment from the other passenger complicates things.\n\nIn many places, there's an expectation to give up a seat to someone who is pregnant, especially if they're visibly uncomfortable. But in this case, the pregnant woman had already given her seat to her friend. The author might not be wrong because the seat was taken by the friend, not the pregnant woman. The author was using a seat that was available when they needed it for an important reason. However, the author's refusal could be seen as inconsiderate, but if the pregnant woman isn't the one asking, maybe it's less clear. The fact that the friend took the seat might mean the author didn't have an obligation to give up their seat. So, the answer might be B (Not the asshole) because the author was in a seat they needed for their test and the pregnant woman's own friend took her seat. The author's refusal was reasonable under those circumstances.\n"
