Today I had a very important test and I wanted to be sure to arrive early and study some more at school so I went out to take the bus one and a half hour before the test. Unfortunately it seems that this morning was particularly busy because it took ONE HOUR for the bus to pass. So there I was, waiting for the transport without the opportunity to study because I might get distracted and miss it (there weren't any benches either, I had to stand still). About five minutes before the bus arrived, a pregnant woman and her friend left their house (which means they didn't had to wait an hour in the heat like me) and took the same bus I was waiting for. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis bus was particularly full of people (and I mean full, there were persons standing) but for some reason two seats were available (I think it was because the sun shined at full force directly on them, but I didn't care)  so I took one of them, put on my headphones without music to drown some sound and started studying. The pregnant woman also took seat besides me, chatting with her friend who was standing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout five minutes in the route, the friend complained about her feet, so the pregnant one offered her the seat, which she happily accepted. Then it happened. The pregnant woman started complaining too. And instead of giving back the seat to her pregnant friend, the other woman asked me if I would give up my seat for her. I had my headphones so I pretended I didn't hear anything. After asking me two more times, the friend pulled out one headphone off my ear and, with a less-than-friendly tone, asked me again. I, of course, refused, arguing that the one who should give up the seat was her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe went nuts and harassed me for the entire ride. Called me names, put her hand on my notebook so I couldn't see anything and refused to give my headphone back unless I gave up my seat, while the pregnant woman only stared at me with the deadliest glare ever. I also heard the passengers talking about me, though some of them saw what happened and defended me. Still, that was one hell of a ride and I can't stop thinking about if I did the correct thing. So, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for refusing to give up their seat to a pregnant woman on a bus. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the circumstances. The author was waiting for an hour in the heat for a bus, had two seats available (which they took to study for an important test), and the pregnant woman and her friend joined the bus. The friend, who had been standing, was offered the seat by the pregnant woman. Then the friend asked the author for the seat, and the author refused. The friend then harassed the author by pulling their headphone and interfering with their studying.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author was obligated to give up their seat. In many places, there are priority seating areas for pregnant women, elderly, disabled, etc. However, the author was in a seat that wasn't necessarily one of those priority seats because the bus was full, but two seats were available due to the sun. The author used one of those seats. \n\nThe pregnant woman was sitting next to the author, and when her friend asked for the seat, the pregnant woman offered hers. The author's refusal was based on the fact that the pregnant woman still had her seat. The friend then escalated the situation, leading to harassment. \n\nThe author's main argument is that they had a right to the seat, especially since they had to wait for so long and had an important test. The friend, not being pregnant, was the one who initially asked for the seat, and the author didn't feel it was their responsibility to give up the seat to someone who wasn't in a more urgent need. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, some might say that pregnant women are often given priority, but the author was in a seat that wasn't a designated priority seat. Also, the author was using the seat to study for an important test, which they prioritized over giving up the seat. However, the way the friend escalated the situation was clearly inappropriate, and the author was being harassed. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They refused a seat to a non-pregnant woman who was standing, but the pregnant woman still had her seat. The author's refusal might be seen as justified if the seat wasn't reserved. However, the author's choice to prioritize their own needs over potentially helping someone else could be seen as inconsiderate. But the harassment from the other woman was uncalled for, and the author was in a stressful situation. \n\nConsidering all this, the author might not be in the wrong because they were in a seat they had a right to take, and the other person's behavior was excessive. However, some might argue that the author should have been more accommodating. But given the context, the author's actions seem reasonable, and the other party's behavior was the main issue.\n"
