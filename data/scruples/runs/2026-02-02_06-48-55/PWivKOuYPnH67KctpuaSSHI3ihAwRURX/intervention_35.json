My grandfather owns a full service gas station where we do tires and mechanic work. When I graduate my grandfather offered me the job of managing the place and I said yes. I\u2019m good with working with my hands and enjoy working on cars but my grandfather wanted me to run the office and do all of the paperwork. When it got super busy I would go out and help with changing tires and oil. One of the workers just quit a few months before I got hired, so there was just one man (he is in his late 40s) beside me. This guy has worked here for 7 years and did all of the mechanic work while my grandfather did the office. The employee brags all the time about how he pretty much ran this place when the other worker quit. While I\u2019m taking care of sending out bills and doing other paperwork the guy comes in and start cussing at me telling me to \u201cget off my ass and do some real work for once\u201d. This happens pretty much every day. After 3 months of it I got pissed off. 3 days ago he came in and said \u201cI\u2019ve got 2 cars out here that need tires on them, why don\u2019t you get off your lazy ass and do some manly work.\u201d I responded with \u201cYou always talk about how you ran this place by yourself so why can\u2019t you do it now, I\u2019m sending out the bills for this month.\u201d He replied \u201cFuck the bills, come out here and change some tires.\u201d This is where I got pissed off \u201cFirst of all\u201d I said \u201c you are not my boss, I\u2019m the one running this place and I sign your paychecks so if anyone is going to tell someone what to do, it\u2019s going to be me telling you.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not taking orders from a damn kid\u201d he said. \u201c Look, I know it\u2019s hard to take orders from someone that\u2019s young and that is new here but you know what\u2019s harder?\u201dthere was a pause and he said \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d \u201cFeeding your family and paying the bills without a fucking  paycheck.\u201d He just looked at me then when back outside and hasn\u2019t said anything to be since. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at an employee for them disrespecting their boss?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after a confrontation with an employee. The situation is that the author is the new manager, taking over an office role, while the employee has been there for seven years doing mechanic work. The employee has been disrespectful, cussing at the author and telling them to do real work. After three months, the author snaps, telling the employee that it's hard to pay the bills without their paycheck and implying the employee should do their job.\n\nFirst, the author is 19 and new to the management position. The employee has been there longer and has a history of disrespect. The author's grandfather gave them the job, so they have authority. The employee's behavior is unprofessional and possibly creating a hostile work environment. The author's response was to stand up for their authority and assert their role as the boss. The employee then stopped talking to them.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the employee's behavior is clearly problematic. As a manager, the author has the right to enforce authority and maintain a professional environment. The employee was disrespectful and not following the chain of command. The author's response, while heated, seems to be a reaction to ongoing disrespect. They also mentioned that they are responsible for sending bills and managing the office, which the employee dismissed. The author's statement about feeding the family without a paycheck is a bit harsh but is likely meant to emphasize the importance of the employee doing their job and respecting the new manager's role.\n\nHowever, the author's use of a swear word (\"fucking\") might be seen as unprofessional, but in the context of standing up to disrespect, it's a common expression of frustration. The key here is whether the author overstepped. The employee had been disrespectful for three months, and the author finally addressed it. The author is in the right because they are establishing boundaries and asserting their role as the boss. The employee's behavior was the root cause, and the author's response was a necessary confrontation to maintain authority. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
