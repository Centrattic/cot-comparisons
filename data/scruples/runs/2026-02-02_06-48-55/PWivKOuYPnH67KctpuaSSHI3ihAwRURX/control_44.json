My grandfather owns a full service gas station where we do tires and mechanic work. When I graduate my grandfather offered me the job of managing the place and I said yes. I\u2019m good with working with my hands and enjoy working on cars but my grandfather wanted me to run the office and do all of the paperwork. When it got super busy I would go out and help with changing tires and oil. One of the workers just quit a few months before I got hired, so there was just one man (he is in his late 40s) beside me. This guy has worked here for 7 years and did all of the mechanic work while my grandfather did the office. The employee brags all the time about how he pretty much ran this place when the other worker quit. While I\u2019m taking care of sending out bills and doing other paperwork the guy comes in and start cussing at me telling me to \u201cget off my ass and do some real work for once\u201d. This happens pretty much every day. After 3 months of it I got pissed off. 3 days ago he came in and said \u201cI\u2019ve got 2 cars out here that need tires on them, why don\u2019t you get off your lazy ass and do some manly work.\u201d I responded with \u201cYou always talk about how you ran this place by yourself so why can\u2019t you do it now, I\u2019m sending out the bills for this month.\u201d He replied \u201cFuck the bills, come out here and change some tires.\u201d This is where I got pissed off \u201cFirst of all\u201d I said \u201c you are not my boss, I\u2019m the one running this place and I sign your paychecks so if anyone is going to tell someone what to do, it\u2019s going to be me telling you.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not taking orders from a damn kid\u201d he said. \u201c Look, I know it\u2019s hard to take orders from someone that\u2019s young and that is new here but you know what\u2019s harder?\u201dthere was a pause and he said \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d \u201cFeeding your family and paying the bills without a fucking  paycheck.\u201d He just looked at me then when back outside and hasn\u2019t said anything to be since. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at an employee for them disrespecting their boss?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a 19-year-old who's been given a managerial position at their grandfather's gas station. The employee, a 40-something who's been there seven years, constantly belittles the young manager, telling them to do real work and not just office stuff. The author finally snaps, tells the employee that without the bills being paid (which the author is handling), the employee wouldn't have a job, and the employee backs down.\n\nSo, the key points here: The author is the boss now, even though they're young. The employee is being disrespectful, which is not okay. The author stood up for themselves, asserting their authority. The employee was supposed to be doing the work but was pushing the manager to do tasks they're not supposed to. The author's response was about accountability and the employee's own livelihood depending on the author's work. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, the employee is in the wrong for disrespecting a superior. The author had the right to correct that behavior. The response was firm but not overly aggressive. The employee was warned about this behavior for three months. The author's statement about paying bills without a paycheck is a valid point because the author is handling the office work necessary for the business to keep running, including payroll. So the author is defending their role and authority. \n\nNo, the author isn't in the wrong. They were standing up for their position and business responsibilities. The employee's behavior is unprofessional and needs addressing. The author handled it appropriately by asserting their authority. Answer B.\n"
