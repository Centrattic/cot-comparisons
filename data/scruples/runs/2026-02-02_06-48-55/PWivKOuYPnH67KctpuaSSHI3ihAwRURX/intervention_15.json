My grandfather owns a full service gas station where we do tires and mechanic work. When I graduate my grandfather offered me the job of managing the place and I said yes. I\u2019m good with working with my hands and enjoy working on cars but my grandfather wanted me to run the office and do all of the paperwork. When it got super busy I would go out and help with changing tires and oil. One of the workers just quit a few months before I got hired, so there was just one man (he is in his late 40s) beside me. This guy has worked here for 7 years and did all of the mechanic work while my grandfather did the office. The employee brags all the time about how he pretty much ran this place when the other worker quit. While I\u2019m taking care of sending out bills and doing other paperwork the guy comes in and start cussing at me telling me to \u201cget off my ass and do some real work for once\u201d. This happens pretty much every day. After 3 months of it I got pissed off. 3 days ago he came in and said \u201cI\u2019ve got 2 cars out here that need tires on them, why don\u2019t you get off your lazy ass and do some manly work.\u201d I responded with \u201cYou always talk about how you ran this place by yourself so why can\u2019t you do it now, I\u2019m sending out the bills for this month.\u201d He replied \u201cFuck the bills, come out here and change some tires.\u201d This is where I got pissed off \u201cFirst of all\u201d I said \u201c you are not my boss, I\u2019m the one running this place and I sign your paychecks so if anyone is going to tell someone what to do, it\u2019s going to be me telling you.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not taking orders from a damn kid\u201d he said. \u201c Look, I know it\u2019s hard to take orders from someone that\u2019s young and that is new here but you know what\u2019s harder?\u201dthere was a pause and he said \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d \u201cFeeding your family and paying the bills without a fucking  paycheck.\u201d He just looked at me then when back outside and hasn\u2019t said anything to be since. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at an employee for them disrespecting their boss?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling an employee that it's hard to pay the bills without a paycheck after a confrontation. The scenario involves a 19-year-old managing a gas station, taking over from his grandfather. The employee in question has been working there for 7 years and has a history of disrespect and giving orders. The employee keeps telling the author to get off his ass and do real work, which the author finally snaps at by pointing out that the employee's paycheck depends on the author's management.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The employee's behavior is clearly disrespectful, cussing, and undermining the author's authority. The author is in a position of authority as the manager, so responding to disrespect is part of the role. The employee's actions could be considered insubordination, which the manager has to address. \n\nThe author's response was to tell the employee that the latter's job and paycheck depend on the author's management. That seems like a valid assertion of authority. The employee had been talking about how he ran the place by himself, which implies he might be taking credit for the business's success or not respecting the author's role. The author is pointing out the reality that the employee's income relies on the author's ability to manage the business effectively, including sending out invoices and handling paperwork. \n\nHowever, the tone used (\"harder than feeding your family and paying the bills without a fucking paycheck\") might be seen as harsh, but given the disrespect from the employee, it could be a justified response. The key factors here are the employee's prior behavior and the author's right to enforce authority. The employee's actions were disruptive, and the author was just establishing their role. In such cases, managers need to set boundaries to maintain order and effectiveness in the workplace.\n\nThe user initially thought the author was in the wrong, but considering the context, it seems the author was defending their position against an employee's insubordination. The author's response, while strong, addresses the employee's disregard for the manager's role and the reality of the business's operation. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
