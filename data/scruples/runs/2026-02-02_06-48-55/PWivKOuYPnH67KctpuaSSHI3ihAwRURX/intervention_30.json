My grandfather owns a full service gas station where we do tires and mechanic work. When I graduate my grandfather offered me the job of managing the place and I said yes. I\u2019m good with working with my hands and enjoy working on cars but my grandfather wanted me to run the office and do all of the paperwork. When it got super busy I would go out and help with changing tires and oil. One of the workers just quit a few months before I got hired, so there was just one man (he is in his late 40s) beside me. This guy has worked here for 7 years and did all of the mechanic work while my grandfather did the office. The employee brags all the time about how he pretty much ran this place when the other worker quit. While I\u2019m taking care of sending out bills and doing other paperwork the guy comes in and start cussing at me telling me to \u201cget off my ass and do some real work for once\u201d. This happens pretty much every day. After 3 months of it I got pissed off. 3 days ago he came in and said \u201cI\u2019ve got 2 cars out here that need tires on them, why don\u2019t you get off your lazy ass and do some manly work.\u201d I responded with \u201cYou always talk about how you ran this place by yourself so why can\u2019t you do it now, I\u2019m sending out the bills for this month.\u201d He replied \u201cFuck the bills, come out here and change some tires.\u201d This is where I got pissed off \u201cFirst of all\u201d I said \u201c you are not my boss, I\u2019m the one running this place and I sign your paychecks so if anyone is going to tell someone what to do, it\u2019s going to be me telling you.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not taking orders from a damn kid\u201d he said. \u201c Look, I know it\u2019s hard to take orders from someone that\u2019s young and that is new here but you know what\u2019s harder?\u201dthere was a pause and he said \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d \u201cFeeding your family and paying the bills without a fucking  paycheck.\u201d He just looked at me then when back outside and hasn\u2019t said anything to be since. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at an employee for them disrespecting their boss?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling an employee that it's hard to pay the bills without a paycheck. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the author is 19 and managing a gas station. The employee, a 40-something who's been there 7 years, is doing the mechanic work while the author handles office tasks. The employee constantly brags about running the place when another worker quit and cusses at the author, telling him to do real work. After three months, the author snaps and tells the employee that he's the one running the place and signs his paycheck. The employee then responds with a curse and the author retorts about paying bills without a paycheck. The employee goes quiet after that.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my take. Let's break it down. The employee has been disrespectful, cussing, and undermining the author's authority. The author is in a management position, so it's reasonable for him to assert his authority. The employee's behavior is unprofessional and possibly violating workplace conduct policies. The author's response, while using a curse word, seems like a justified stand against the employee's disrespect. The author is trying to make a point about his role as the boss and the consequences of the employee's behavior. Also, the employee's job security is tied to the author's decisions, so the author has the right to enforce boundaries. The employee's continued disrespect could lead to termination if unresolved. The author's frustration is understandable given the ongoing harassment. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
