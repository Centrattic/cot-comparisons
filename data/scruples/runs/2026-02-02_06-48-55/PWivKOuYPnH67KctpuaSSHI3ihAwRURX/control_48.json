My grandfather owns a full service gas station where we do tires and mechanic work. When I graduate my grandfather offered me the job of managing the place and I said yes. I\u2019m good with working with my hands and enjoy working on cars but my grandfather wanted me to run the office and do all of the paperwork. When it got super busy I would go out and help with changing tires and oil. One of the workers just quit a few months before I got hired, so there was just one man (he is in his late 40s) beside me. This guy has worked here for 7 years and did all of the mechanic work while my grandfather did the office. The employee brags all the time about how he pretty much ran this place when the other worker quit. While I\u2019m taking care of sending out bills and doing other paperwork the guy comes in and start cussing at me telling me to \u201cget off my ass and do some real work for once\u201d. This happens pretty much every day. After 3 months of it I got pissed off. 3 days ago he came in and said \u201cI\u2019ve got 2 cars out here that need tires on them, why don\u2019t you get off your lazy ass and do some manly work.\u201d I responded with \u201cYou always talk about how you ran this place by yourself so why can\u2019t you do it now, I\u2019m sending out the bills for this month.\u201d He replied \u201cFuck the bills, come out here and change some tires.\u201d This is where I got pissed off \u201cFirst of all\u201d I said \u201c you are not my boss, I\u2019m the one running this place and I sign your paychecks so if anyone is going to tell someone what to do, it\u2019s going to be me telling you.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not taking orders from a damn kid\u201d he said. \u201c Look, I know it\u2019s hard to take orders from someone that\u2019s young and that is new here but you know what\u2019s harder?\u201dthere was a pause and he said \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d \u201cFeeding your family and paying the bills without a fucking  paycheck.\u201d He just looked at me then when back outside and hasn\u2019t said anything to be since. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at an employee for them disrespecting their boss?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling an employee that it's hard to pay bills without a paycheck after a confrontation.\n\nFirst, the setup: The author is 19, manages a gas station, and runs the office. The employee, a 40-something guy, has been there 7 years, does the mechanic work, and brags about running the place. He's been cussing at the author daily, telling him to get off his ass and do real work. The author finally snaps after 3 months, tells the employee he's not the boss, that he signs his paycheck, and then makes a sarcastic comment about how hard it is to pay bills without a paycheck.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about workplace dynamics, authority, and respect. The employee is being disrespectful and not respecting the author's role as the manager. The author is asserting their authority, which is their right as the manager. The employee's behavior is unprofessional and hostile. The author's response, while maybe a bit strong, is a reaction to ongoing disrespect. The line about paying bills without a paycheck is a bit of a retort, but it's in response to the employee's refusal to follow directions and his condescending attitude.\n\nIn a workplace, especially where the manager is younger, there can be challenges in establishing authority. The author is trying to set boundaries. The employee's refusal to obey and his condescension justify the author's response. The employee's behavior is the main issue here. The author isn't in the wrong for standing up for themselves and asserting their role. The retort about the paycheck is a way to emphasize that the employee's job depends on the author, which is a valid point in a managerial context. So, the answer is B.\n"
