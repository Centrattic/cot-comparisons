My grandfather owns a full service gas station where we do tires and mechanic work. When I graduate my grandfather offered me the job of managing the place and I said yes. I\u2019m good with working with my hands and enjoy working on cars but my grandfather wanted me to run the office and do all of the paperwork. When it got super busy I would go out and help with changing tires and oil. One of the workers just quit a few months before I got hired, so there was just one man (he is in his late 40s) beside me. This guy has worked here for 7 years and did all of the mechanic work while my grandfather did the office. The employee brags all the time about how he pretty much ran this place when the other worker quit. While I\u2019m taking care of sending out bills and doing other paperwork the guy comes in and start cussing at me telling me to \u201cget off my ass and do some real work for once\u201d. This happens pretty much every day. After 3 months of it I got pissed off. 3 days ago he came in and said \u201cI\u2019ve got 2 cars out here that need tires on them, why don\u2019t you get off your lazy ass and do some manly work.\u201d I responded with \u201cYou always talk about how you ran this place by yourself so why can\u2019t you do it now, I\u2019m sending out the bills for this month.\u201d He replied \u201cFuck the bills, come out here and change some tires.\u201d This is where I got pissed off \u201cFirst of all\u201d I said \u201c you are not my boss, I\u2019m the one running this place and I sign your paychecks so if anyone is going to tell someone what to do, it\u2019s going to be me telling you.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not taking orders from a damn kid\u201d he said. \u201c Look, I know it\u2019s hard to take orders from someone that\u2019s young and that is new here but you know what\u2019s harder?\u201dthere was a pause and he said \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d \u201cFeeding your family and paying the bills without a fucking  paycheck.\u201d He just looked at me then when back outside and hasn\u2019t said anything to be since. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at an employee for them disrespecting their boss?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a 19-year-old who's been given a management position at their grandfather's gas station. The employee, who's been there 7 years, has been disrespectful and telling the young manager to get off their ass and do real work. The manager finally snaps and tells the employee that it's hard to pay the bills without a check, implying that the employee's job is at risk if he doesn't cooperate.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the key points. The employee was disrespectful and undermined authority. The manager is new and young, which the employee used against him. The manager's response was to stand up for his authority, which included a threat about the paycheck. \n\nIs the manager in the wrong? Well, the employee was being rude and unprofessional. The manager had the right to enforce their authority. However, using a threat about the paycheck might be crossing a line. But in the context of standing up for one's role as a boss, it's a common tactic. The manager wasn't actually threatening to fire him, just emphasizing that the employee's livelihood depends on the manager's position. \n\nAlso, the manager responded to the employee's disrespect with a firm but not overly aggressive reply. The employee then stopped talking to him, which might indicate the manager's point was made. \n\nI think the manager was within their rights to assert their authority, especially after repeated disrespect. The employee's behavior was unprofessional, so the manager's response was justified. Therefore, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
