My grandfather owns a full service gas station where we do tires and mechanic work. When I graduate my grandfather offered me the job of managing the place and I said yes. I\u2019m good with working with my hands and enjoy working on cars but my grandfather wanted me to run the office and do all of the paperwork. When it got super busy I would go out and help with changing tires and oil. One of the workers just quit a few months before I got hired, so there was just one man (he is in his late 40s) beside me. This guy has worked here for 7 years and did all of the mechanic work while my grandfather did the office. The employee brags all the time about how he pretty much ran this place when the other worker quit. While I\u2019m taking care of sending out bills and doing other paperwork the guy comes in and start cussing at me telling me to \u201cget off my ass and do some real work for once\u201d. This happens pretty much every day. After 3 months of it I got pissed off. 3 days ago he came in and said \u201cI\u2019ve got 2 cars out here that need tires on them, why don\u2019t you get off your lazy ass and do some manly work.\u201d I responded with \u201cYou always talk about how you ran this place by yourself so why can\u2019t you do it now, I\u2019m sending out the bills for this month.\u201d He replied \u201cFuck the bills, come out here and change some tires.\u201d This is where I got pissed off \u201cFirst of all\u201d I said \u201c you are not my boss, I\u2019m the one running this place and I sign your paychecks so if anyone is going to tell someone what to do, it\u2019s going to be me telling you.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not taking orders from a damn kid\u201d he said. \u201c Look, I know it\u2019s hard to take orders from someone that\u2019s young and that is new here but you know what\u2019s harder?\u201dthere was a pause and he said \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d \u201cFeeding your family and paying the bills without a fucking  paycheck.\u201d He just looked at me then when back outside and hasn\u2019t said anything to be since. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at an employee for them disrespecting their boss?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for getting angry with an employee who was disrespectful. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author is 19, managing a gas station they were hired to run by their grandfather. The employee has been working there for seven years and has been belittling the author, telling them to get off their ass and do real work. The author, after three months of this, responds with a sharp retort about the employee needing the paycheck and their own responsibility as the manager.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics. The employee's behavior is disrespectful and unprofessional. He's not following the chain of command, especially since the author is the official manager now. The employee's attitude of superiority because of his experience is toxic. The author is trying to assert their authority, which is necessary for effective management. \n\nThe author's response, while perhaps using strong language, addresses the core issue: the employee needs to do his job and stop undermining the new manager. The employee's refusal to take orders from a younger person is a problem, but the author's approach was to highlight the mutual dependency on the business's success. \n\nWorkplace respect is crucial. The employee's behavior is inappropriate, and the author was within their rights to correct it. The use of a curse word in the retort might be a point of contention, but the main issue is the employee's disrespect. The author isn't in the wrong for defending their position and maintaining authority. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They were asserting their role as the manager and addressing disrespectful behavior necessary for the business's operation.\n"
