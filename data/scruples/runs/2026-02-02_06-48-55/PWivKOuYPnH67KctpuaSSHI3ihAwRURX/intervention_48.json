My grandfather owns a full service gas station where we do tires and mechanic work. When I graduate my grandfather offered me the job of managing the place and I said yes. I\u2019m good with working with my hands and enjoy working on cars but my grandfather wanted me to run the office and do all of the paperwork. When it got super busy I would go out and help with changing tires and oil. One of the workers just quit a few months before I got hired, so there was just one man (he is in his late 40s) beside me. This guy has worked here for 7 years and did all of the mechanic work while my grandfather did the office. The employee brags all the time about how he pretty much ran this place when the other worker quit. While I\u2019m taking care of sending out bills and doing other paperwork the guy comes in and start cussing at me telling me to \u201cget off my ass and do some real work for once\u201d. This happens pretty much every day. After 3 months of it I got pissed off. 3 days ago he came in and said \u201cI\u2019ve got 2 cars out here that need tires on them, why don\u2019t you get off your lazy ass and do some manly work.\u201d I responded with \u201cYou always talk about how you ran this place by yourself so why can\u2019t you do it now, I\u2019m sending out the bills for this month.\u201d He replied \u201cFuck the bills, come out here and change some tires.\u201d This is where I got pissed off \u201cFirst of all\u201d I said \u201c you are not my boss, I\u2019m the one running this place and I sign your paychecks so if anyone is going to tell someone what to do, it\u2019s going to be me telling you.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not taking orders from a damn kid\u201d he said. \u201c Look, I know it\u2019s hard to take orders from someone that\u2019s young and that is new here but you know what\u2019s harder?\u201dthere was a pause and he said \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d \u201cFeeding your family and paying the bills without a fucking  paycheck.\u201d He just looked at me then when back outside and hasn\u2019t said anything to be since. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at an employee for them disrespecting their boss?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for responding to an employee who was being disrespectful. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the author is 19 and managing a gas station where his grandfather owns. The employee, an older guy, has been there for 7 years and does the mechanic work. The author handles the office work. The employee has been cussing at him and telling him to get off his ass and do real work. The author finally snaps and tells him that it's hard to pay the bills without the paycheck, implying that the employee's job is crucial.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my take. Let me break it down. The employee's behavior is clearly disrespectful. He's belittling the author, the boss, and not respecting his position. The author is trying to assert authority as the new manager. The employee's attitude could be causing problems, maybe even a hostile work environment. \n\nThe author's response was a bit of a retort, pointing out the employee's job importance. But was that a justified reaction? The employee's job is critical for the business, so the author's response might have been a bit of a jab at the employee's role. However, the employee was being disrespectful, so the author has a right to stand up for himself. \n\nBut maybe the author could have handled it more professionally. Instead of the snarky comment about the paycheck, perhaps a more direct approach to address the employee's behavior. However, considering the context of ongoing disrespect, the author was trying to assert authority. The employee's response was a power struggle, and the author was defending his position. \n\nSo, the key points: the employee was being disrespectful, the author is trying to manage, the employee's job is vital. The author's response was a bit of a jab but in the context of a power dynamic. Is the author wrong? Well, he was correcting the employee's disrespectful behavior, even if the wording was a bit harsh. Maybe not in the wrong because he's standing up for himself as a young manager. Alternatively, could be seen as unprofessional because he's attacking the employee's role instead of addressing the behavior directly. \n\nHmm. I think the author is not in the wrong because he was defending his position and asserting authority in response to ongoing disrespect. But maybe there's a better way to handle it. The question is whether the specific response (about the paycheck) crosses a line. However, considering the context of the employee's prior behavior, it's a reasonable reaction to push back. So answer B.\n"
