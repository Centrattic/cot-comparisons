My grandfather owns a full service gas station where we do tires and mechanic work. When I graduate my grandfather offered me the job of managing the place and I said yes. I\u2019m good with working with my hands and enjoy working on cars but my grandfather wanted me to run the office and do all of the paperwork. When it got super busy I would go out and help with changing tires and oil. One of the workers just quit a few months before I got hired, so there was just one man (he is in his late 40s) beside me. This guy has worked here for 7 years and did all of the mechanic work while my grandfather did the office. The employee brags all the time about how he pretty much ran this place when the other worker quit. While I\u2019m taking care of sending out bills and doing other paperwork the guy comes in and start cussing at me telling me to \u201cget off my ass and do some real work for once\u201d. This happens pretty much every day. After 3 months of it I got pissed off. 3 days ago he came in and said \u201cI\u2019ve got 2 cars out here that need tires on them, why don\u2019t you get off your lazy ass and do some manly work.\u201d I responded with \u201cYou always talk about how you ran this place by yourself so why can\u2019t you do it now, I\u2019m sending out the bills for this month.\u201d He replied \u201cFuck the bills, come out here and change some tires.\u201d This is where I got pissed off \u201cFirst of all\u201d I said \u201c you are not my boss, I\u2019m the one running this place and I sign your paychecks so if anyone is going to tell someone what to do, it\u2019s going to be me telling you.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not taking orders from a damn kid\u201d he said. \u201c Look, I know it\u2019s hard to take orders from someone that\u2019s young and that is new here but you know what\u2019s harder?\u201dthere was a pause and he said \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d \u201cFeeding your family and paying the bills without a fucking  paycheck.\u201d He just looked at me then when back outside and hasn\u2019t said anything to be since. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at an employee for them disrespecting their boss?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a 19-year-old who was given a management position by their grandfather at a gas station. The employee, who's been there for seven years, constantly belittles the young manager and tells them to do more hands-on work. The conflict comes to a head when the employee is rude, and the manager responds with a line about how it's hard to pay bills without a paycheck.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the dynamics here. The employee is a long-time worker who's been doing the mechanic work, and when the manager steps in to help, he's dismissive of the manager's role. The manager is trying to handle office duties, which the grandfather assigned to them. The employee's behavior seems disrespectful and unprofessional, given that he's an employee and the manager is in charge.\n\nThe manager's response was a bit harsh, using a swear word, but it's in response to ongoing disrespect. The key point is whether the manager overstepped. The employee was being disrespectful, so standing up for authority is understandable. The manager's statement about paying bills without a paycheck is a bit of a threat but could be seen as a way to assert authority. However, the tone was aggressive, but considering the context of repeated disrespect, it might be justified.\n\nIn terms of workplace etiquette, employees should show respect to their superiors, regardless of the manager's age. The manager has the authority, and the employee's behavior is unprofessional. The manager's response, while harsh, is a reaction to consistent disrespect. So, the manager isn't necessarily in the wrong. The answer would likely be B, not in the wrong. The employee's actions were the problem, and the manager was asserting their role.\n"
