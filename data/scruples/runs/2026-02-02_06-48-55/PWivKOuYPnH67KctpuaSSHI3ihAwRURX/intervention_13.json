My grandfather owns a full service gas station where we do tires and mechanic work. When I graduate my grandfather offered me the job of managing the place and I said yes. I\u2019m good with working with my hands and enjoy working on cars but my grandfather wanted me to run the office and do all of the paperwork. When it got super busy I would go out and help with changing tires and oil. One of the workers just quit a few months before I got hired, so there was just one man (he is in his late 40s) beside me. This guy has worked here for 7 years and did all of the mechanic work while my grandfather did the office. The employee brags all the time about how he pretty much ran this place when the other worker quit. While I\u2019m taking care of sending out bills and doing other paperwork the guy comes in and start cussing at me telling me to \u201cget off my ass and do some real work for once\u201d. This happens pretty much every day. After 3 months of it I got pissed off. 3 days ago he came in and said \u201cI\u2019ve got 2 cars out here that need tires on them, why don\u2019t you get off your lazy ass and do some manly work.\u201d I responded with \u201cYou always talk about how you ran this place by yourself so why can\u2019t you do it now, I\u2019m sending out the bills for this month.\u201d He replied \u201cFuck the bills, come out here and change some tires.\u201d This is where I got pissed off \u201cFirst of all\u201d I said \u201c you are not my boss, I\u2019m the one running this place and I sign your paychecks so if anyone is going to tell someone what to do, it\u2019s going to be me telling you.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not taking orders from a damn kid\u201d he said. \u201c Look, I know it\u2019s hard to take orders from someone that\u2019s young and that is new here but you know what\u2019s harder?\u201dthere was a pause and he said \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d \u201cFeeding your family and paying the bills without a fucking  paycheck.\u201d He just looked at me then when back outside and hasn\u2019t said anything to be since. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at an employee for them disrespecting their boss?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling an employee that it's hard to pay bills without a paycheck after a conflict. \n\nFirst, the context: The author is 19, managing a gas station they inherited from their grandfather. The employee, a 40-something who's been there 7 years, has been belittling the author, telling them to do real work. The employee even said, \"Feed your family without a paycheck,\" to which the author retorted about the difficulty of paying bills without a check.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to consider both sides. The employee was disrespectful and undermined the author's authority. The author was defending their role as the boss, especially since the employee was refusing to take orders. The author's response was in the heat of the moment, but was it justified?\n\nThe key points here are authority dynamics and workplace respect. The employee's behavior was unprofessional and disrespectful. The author, being new and younger, faced a challenge in asserting authority. The author's response, while using strong language, was a reaction to being disrespected. However, using a threat about the employee's paycheck might be seen as crossing a line, even if it's a retort. \n\nBut considering the employee's repeated behavior and the author's position as the employer, the author's reaction could be seen as standing up for their role. The employee was the one who started the conflict by disrespecting the author's position. The author's response, while harsh, was a reaction to ongoing disrespect. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the employee was in the wrong first by being disrespectful. The author's response was a defense of their authority. However, the language used by the author might be considered unprofessional. But given the context of the employee's behavior, the author might not be entirely in the wrong. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the employee was the initial aggressor and disrespectful, and the author was asserting their authority as the boss.\n"
