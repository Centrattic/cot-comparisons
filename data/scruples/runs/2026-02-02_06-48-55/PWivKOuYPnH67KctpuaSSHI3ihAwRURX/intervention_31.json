My grandfather owns a full service gas station where we do tires and mechanic work. When I graduate my grandfather offered me the job of managing the place and I said yes. I\u2019m good with working with my hands and enjoy working on cars but my grandfather wanted me to run the office and do all of the paperwork. When it got super busy I would go out and help with changing tires and oil. One of the workers just quit a few months before I got hired, so there was just one man (he is in his late 40s) beside me. This guy has worked here for 7 years and did all of the mechanic work while my grandfather did the office. The employee brags all the time about how he pretty much ran this place when the other worker quit. While I\u2019m taking care of sending out bills and doing other paperwork the guy comes in and start cussing at me telling me to \u201cget off my ass and do some real work for once\u201d. This happens pretty much every day. After 3 months of it I got pissed off. 3 days ago he came in and said \u201cI\u2019ve got 2 cars out here that need tires on them, why don\u2019t you get off your lazy ass and do some manly work.\u201d I responded with \u201cYou always talk about how you ran this place by yourself so why can\u2019t you do it now, I\u2019m sending out the bills for this month.\u201d He replied \u201cFuck the bills, come out here and change some tires.\u201d This is where I got pissed off \u201cFirst of all\u201d I said \u201c you are not my boss, I\u2019m the one running this place and I sign your paychecks so if anyone is going to tell someone what to do, it\u2019s going to be me telling you.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not taking orders from a damn kid\u201d he said. \u201c Look, I know it\u2019s hard to take orders from someone that\u2019s young and that is new here but you know what\u2019s harder?\u201dthere was a pause and he said \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d \u201cFeeding your family and paying the bills without a fucking  paycheck.\u201d He just looked at me then when back outside and hasn\u2019t said anything to be since. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at an employee for them disrespecting their boss?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a 19-year-old who was hired by their grandfather to manage a gas station. The employee, a 40-something guy who's been there 7 years, is being disrespectful, telling the author to \"get off his ass\" and do real work. The author responded by asserting their authority, mentioning that they sign the employee's paycheck, and then made a comment about the difficulty of paying bills without a check.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is the new manager, even though they're young. The employee is experienced and has a history of taking over when others quit. The employee's behavior is clearly disrespectful and unprofessional, which as a boss, the author has a right to address. The employee's actions could be seen as insubordination.\n\nThe author's response included a direct assertion of authority by pointing out that they sign the paycheck, which is a valid point. Then they made a sarcastic comment implying that the employee's lack of payment is because he's not following orders. But maybe the language used was harsh. The employee was being disrespectful, so the author was defending their role. However, using a phrase like \"harder... paying the bills without a f*cking check\" could be seen as an insult, even if it's a retort to the employee's insults.\n\nIs it appropriate to respond with a similar level of profanity? The employee was cussing and being rude first, so the author might be justified in using strong language in self-defense. But maybe there's a difference between standing up for authority and responding with a harsh retort. The author's comment was meant to show the employee who's in charge, but it might be seen as unprofessional or even bullying.\n\nAlso, the employee hasn't spoken to the author since, which could be a good sign that the author's response was effective, or it could mean the employee is upset and might retaliate. However, the key question is whether the author was in the wrong for responding as they did. Given that the employee was being disrespectful and the author was asserting their role, it's possible that the author's response, while strong, was a legitimate defense of their authority. However, using such a sharp retort might not be the best approach in a professional setting, even if the employee was at fault.\n\nIn many cases, managers are expected to maintain professionalism and not stoop to the level of the employee's behavior. However, the employee was actively undermining the manager's authority. So it's a bit of a gray area. The author might not be in the wrong because they were defending their position, but the method could be questionable. Alternatively, if the author had responded with a calmer, more professional approach, it might have been better. But given the context of ongoing disrespect, the author's response might be seen as justified.\n"
