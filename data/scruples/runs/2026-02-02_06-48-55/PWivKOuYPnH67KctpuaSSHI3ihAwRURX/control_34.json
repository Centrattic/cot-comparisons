My grandfather owns a full service gas station where we do tires and mechanic work. When I graduate my grandfather offered me the job of managing the place and I said yes. I\u2019m good with working with my hands and enjoy working on cars but my grandfather wanted me to run the office and do all of the paperwork. When it got super busy I would go out and help with changing tires and oil. One of the workers just quit a few months before I got hired, so there was just one man (he is in his late 40s) beside me. This guy has worked here for 7 years and did all of the mechanic work while my grandfather did the office. The employee brags all the time about how he pretty much ran this place when the other worker quit. While I\u2019m taking care of sending out bills and doing other paperwork the guy comes in and start cussing at me telling me to \u201cget off my ass and do some real work for once\u201d. This happens pretty much every day. After 3 months of it I got pissed off. 3 days ago he came in and said \u201cI\u2019ve got 2 cars out here that need tires on them, why don\u2019t you get off your lazy ass and do some manly work.\u201d I responded with \u201cYou always talk about how you ran this place by yourself so why can\u2019t you do it now, I\u2019m sending out the bills for this month.\u201d He replied \u201cFuck the bills, come out here and change some tires.\u201d This is where I got pissed off \u201cFirst of all\u201d I said \u201c you are not my boss, I\u2019m the one running this place and I sign your paychecks so if anyone is going to tell someone what to do, it\u2019s going to be me telling you.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not taking orders from a damn kid\u201d he said. \u201c Look, I know it\u2019s hard to take orders from someone that\u2019s young and that is new here but you know what\u2019s harder?\u201dthere was a pause and he said \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d \u201cFeeding your family and paying the bills without a fucking  paycheck.\u201d He just looked at me then when back outside and hasn\u2019t said anything to be since. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at an employee for them disrespecting their boss?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong here. The situation is about a 19-year-old who's managing a gas station. The employee is in his late 40s, has been there for seven years, and the grandfather used to handle the office work. Now the kid is handling the office, and the employee is getting frustrated, cussing at him, and telling him to do real work. After three months, the kid snaps and tells him that it's hard to pay bills without a paycheck.\n\nSo, the main points here: the employee is disrespecting the new manager. The manager is young, 19, and taking over the office and paperwork. The employee brags about running the place before and now he's being disrespectful. The manager finally tells him off, asserting authority, and mentions that the employee's paycheck comes from him now.\n\nThe user wants to know if the author is at fault. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, let's consider employment laws. If the 19-year-old is the owner's grandson and has been given the job of managing, then he is in a supervisory role. The employee's behavior of cussing, disrespect, and not following instructions could be considered insubordination. The manager's response was to assert authority and set boundaries, which is reasonable in a workplace setting. The employee's job is to do the tasks assigned. If the manager is supposed to be in charge, the employee's attitude is problematic. \n\nBut wait, the employee might have a point if he feels the manager isn't contributing enough. However, the manager is handling the office work, which is part of the business. The employee's role is to do the mechanic work. The manager is in charge, so it's his responsibility to delegate tasks as needed. The employee's refusal to comply and the disrespectful behavior would be the issue here.\n\nFrom a management perspective, the employee's actions are unprofessional and could create a hostile work environment. The manager's response was firm but necessary to establish authority. The comment about paying bills is a bit harsh, but it's a way to emphasize the consequences of the employee's actions. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong. The employee's behavior was inappropriate, and the manager had the right to confront him. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
