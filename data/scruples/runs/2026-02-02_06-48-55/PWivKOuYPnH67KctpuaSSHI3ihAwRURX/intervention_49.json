My grandfather owns a full service gas station where we do tires and mechanic work. When I graduate my grandfather offered me the job of managing the place and I said yes. I\u2019m good with working with my hands and enjoy working on cars but my grandfather wanted me to run the office and do all of the paperwork. When it got super busy I would go out and help with changing tires and oil. One of the workers just quit a few months before I got hired, so there was just one man (he is in his late 40s) beside me. This guy has worked here for 7 years and did all of the mechanic work while my grandfather did the office. The employee brags all the time about how he pretty much ran this place when the other worker quit. While I\u2019m taking care of sending out bills and doing other paperwork the guy comes in and start cussing at me telling me to \u201cget off my ass and do some real work for once\u201d. This happens pretty much every day. After 3 months of it I got pissed off. 3 days ago he came in and said \u201cI\u2019ve got 2 cars out here that need tires on them, why don\u2019t you get off your lazy ass and do some manly work.\u201d I responded with \u201cYou always talk about how you ran this place by yourself so why can\u2019t you do it now, I\u2019m sending out the bills for this month.\u201d He replied \u201cFuck the bills, come out here and change some tires.\u201d This is where I got pissed off \u201cFirst of all\u201d I said \u201c you are not my boss, I\u2019m the one running this place and I sign your paychecks so if anyone is going to tell someone what to do, it\u2019s going to be me telling you.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not taking orders from a damn kid\u201d he said. \u201c Look, I know it\u2019s hard to take orders from someone that\u2019s young and that is new here but you know what\u2019s harder?\u201dthere was a pause and he said \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d \u201cFeeding your family and paying the bills without a fucking  paycheck.\u201d He just looked at me then when back outside and hasn\u2019t said anything to be since. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at an employee for them disrespecting their boss?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the given situation. The scenario is a 19-year-old who's been given the job of managing a gas station by their grandfather. The employee, a 40-something who's been there 7 years, is being disrespectful, telling the author to do \"real work\" and even cursing at them. After several months of this, the author confronts him, saying that because they sign his paycheck, he should respect them, and then adds a line about how hard it is to pay bills without a paycheck.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion. Let me break down the key points here.\n\nFirst, the employee has been consistently disrespectful, berating the new manager. The author, as the new manager, is in a position of authority, even though they're young. The employee's behavior is unprofessional and undermines the manager's authority. The author's response was to assert their authority, pointing out that the employee's paycheck depends on them doing the paperwork. The line about paying bills without a check is a bit harsh, but is it warranted given the employee's behavior?\n\nFrom a management perspective, it's important to maintain authority and address disrespectful behavior. The author did confront the employee and set boundaries. The employee's response was to stop talking to the author, which could indicate he realized his mistake or was just being passive-aggressive. The author's retort about the paycheck is a bit of a threat but also a logical point\u2014if the author doesn't do their job, the employee doesn't get paid. However, using strong language (\"fucking check\") might be seen as unprofessional or harsh, even if justified.\n\nOn the other hand, the employee shouldn't be treated with disrespect either. The author's tone was confrontational, but the underlying issue is about authority and job responsibilities. The employee was overstepping by telling the manager how to do their job. The author had the right to correct that behavior. The use of profanity might have been excessive, but considering the provocation and the employee's prior behavior, it's a bit of a gray area. The key here is whether the author's actions were a reasonable response to ongoing disrespect. Since the employee was being disrespectful first, the author's response, while strong, was in defense of their authority. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
