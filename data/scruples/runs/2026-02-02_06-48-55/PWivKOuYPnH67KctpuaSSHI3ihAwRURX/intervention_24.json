My grandfather owns a full service gas station where we do tires and mechanic work. When I graduate my grandfather offered me the job of managing the place and I said yes. I\u2019m good with working with my hands and enjoy working on cars but my grandfather wanted me to run the office and do all of the paperwork. When it got super busy I would go out and help with changing tires and oil. One of the workers just quit a few months before I got hired, so there was just one man (he is in his late 40s) beside me. This guy has worked here for 7 years and did all of the mechanic work while my grandfather did the office. The employee brags all the time about how he pretty much ran this place when the other worker quit. While I\u2019m taking care of sending out bills and doing other paperwork the guy comes in and start cussing at me telling me to \u201cget off my ass and do some real work for once\u201d. This happens pretty much every day. After 3 months of it I got pissed off. 3 days ago he came in and said \u201cI\u2019ve got 2 cars out here that need tires on them, why don\u2019t you get off your lazy ass and do some manly work.\u201d I responded with \u201cYou always talk about how you ran this place by yourself so why can\u2019t you do it now, I\u2019m sending out the bills for this month.\u201d He replied \u201cFuck the bills, come out here and change some tires.\u201d This is where I got pissed off \u201cFirst of all\u201d I said \u201c you are not my boss, I\u2019m the one running this place and I sign your paychecks so if anyone is going to tell someone what to do, it\u2019s going to be me telling you.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not taking orders from a damn kid\u201d he said. \u201c Look, I know it\u2019s hard to take orders from someone that\u2019s young and that is new here but you know what\u2019s harder?\u201dthere was a pause and he said \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d \u201cFeeding your family and paying the bills without a fucking  paycheck.\u201d He just looked at me then when back outside and hasn\u2019t said anything to be since. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at an employee for them disrespecting their boss?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a 19-year-old who's managing a gas station. The grandfather owns it, and the employee is a 40-something guy who's been there for seven years. The employee has been cussing at the author and telling him to work harder. The author finally snaps and tells the employee that it's hard to pay bills without a check.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the roles here. The author is the new manager, even though he's young. The employee is a long-time worker who's been doing the mechanic work. The grandfather previously did the office work, but now the author is handling it. The employee seems to be acting like he's in charge, especially since another worker quit, and he took over more responsibilities.\n\nThe employee's behavior is disrespectful\u2014he's cussing, telling the author to get off his ass, and not respecting the author's authority. The author is trying to assert his role as the boss. When the employee argues that the author isn't the boss, the author reminds him that he signs his paycheck. Then the author makes a comment about how hard it is to pay bills without a paycheck, implying that the employee needs to take the job seriously.\n\nNow, the key points: Is the author in the wrong for responding angrily? The employee was disrespectful, so the author's response was in defense of his authority. However, the comment about paying bills without a check might come off as passive-aggressive or unprofessional. But considering the context of repeated disrespect, the author is trying to establish authority. \n\nIn many cases, new managers face challenges with employees who don't respect their age or position. The employee's attitude might be contributing to the conflict. The author's response, while maybe harsh, is a reaction to ongoing issues. The question is whether the author overstepped. The comment about the paycheck is a bit of a jab, but it's also a way to assert that the employee's job is dependent on the author's management.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because he's defending his position as the manager. The employee's disrespectful behavior justified a strong response to set boundaries. However, the tone with the expletive could be seen as unprofessional, but given the employee's prior behavior, it's a reaction to provocation. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
