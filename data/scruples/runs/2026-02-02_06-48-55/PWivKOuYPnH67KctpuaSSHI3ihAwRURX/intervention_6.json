My grandfather owns a full service gas station where we do tires and mechanic work. When I graduate my grandfather offered me the job of managing the place and I said yes. I\u2019m good with working with my hands and enjoy working on cars but my grandfather wanted me to run the office and do all of the paperwork. When it got super busy I would go out and help with changing tires and oil. One of the workers just quit a few months before I got hired, so there was just one man (he is in his late 40s) beside me. This guy has worked here for 7 years and did all of the mechanic work while my grandfather did the office. The employee brags all the time about how he pretty much ran this place when the other worker quit. While I\u2019m taking care of sending out bills and doing other paperwork the guy comes in and start cussing at me telling me to \u201cget off my ass and do some real work for once\u201d. This happens pretty much every day. After 3 months of it I got pissed off. 3 days ago he came in and said \u201cI\u2019ve got 2 cars out here that need tires on them, why don\u2019t you get off your lazy ass and do some manly work.\u201d I responded with \u201cYou always talk about how you ran this place by yourself so why can\u2019t you do it now, I\u2019m sending out the bills for this month.\u201d He replied \u201cFuck the bills, come out here and change some tires.\u201d This is where I got pissed off \u201cFirst of all\u201d I said \u201c you are not my boss, I\u2019m the one running this place and I sign your paychecks so if anyone is going to tell someone what to do, it\u2019s going to be me telling you.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not taking orders from a damn kid\u201d he said. \u201c Look, I know it\u2019s hard to take orders from someone that\u2019s young and that is new here but you know what\u2019s harder?\u201dthere was a pause and he said \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d \u201cFeeding your family and paying the bills without a fucking  paycheck.\u201d He just looked at me then when back outside and hasn\u2019t said anything to be since. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at an employee for them disrespecting their boss?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the author did something wrong by telling their employee that it's hard to pay the bills without a check. The situation is that the author, who's 19 and managing a gas station, is dealing with an older employee who's been disrespectful and cussing at them. The author got angry and retorted with a comment about feeding the family and bills.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The employee has been rude and not respecting the author's authority. The author is the boss now, even though they're young. The employee's behavior is unprofessional and potentially abusive. The author's response was in the heat of the moment, but the key is whether the response was justified.\n\nThe employee was being disrespectful, so the author's frustration is understandable. The author called out the employee's behavior and reminded them that they're the one signing the paycheck. The comment about paying bills without a check is a bit harsh, but maybe it's a way to emphasize that the employee's attitude is affecting the business. It's a bit of a threat but also a statement of reality.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? The employee was the one being disrespectful first. The author is trying to assert authority. The response might be aggressive, but it's a reaction to the employee's ongoing behavior. The author's comment about bills and paycheck could be seen as a bit of an ultimatum, implying that if the employee doesn't do their job, they might not get paid. But is that acceptable?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the author should have addressed the employee's behavior more professionally, like a formal reprimand instead of a confrontation. The author's approach might have been too confrontational and personal. However, considering the employee's repeated disrespect, the author might feel they have to set boundaries.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the employee was clearly in the wrong by disrespecting the boss. The author's response was in self-defense for their position. The author's statement about the bills is a bit of a threat but might be a necessary step to enforce authority. So, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong here. They were defending their role and the business's operations against an uncooperative employee. Therefore, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
