My grandfather owns a full service gas station where we do tires and mechanic work. When I graduate my grandfather offered me the job of managing the place and I said yes. I\u2019m good with working with my hands and enjoy working on cars but my grandfather wanted me to run the office and do all of the paperwork. When it got super busy I would go out and help with changing tires and oil. One of the workers just quit a few months before I got hired, so there was just one man (he is in his late 40s) beside me. This guy has worked here for 7 years and did all of the mechanic work while my grandfather did the office. The employee brags all the time about how he pretty much ran this place when the other worker quit. While I\u2019m taking care of sending out bills and doing other paperwork the guy comes in and start cussing at me telling me to \u201cget off my ass and do some real work for once\u201d. This happens pretty much every day. After 3 months of it I got pissed off. 3 days ago he came in and said \u201cI\u2019ve got 2 cars out here that need tires on them, why don\u2019t you get off your lazy ass and do some manly work.\u201d I responded with \u201cYou always talk about how you ran this place by yourself so why can\u2019t you do it now, I\u2019m sending out the bills for this month.\u201d He replied \u201cFuck the bills, come out here and change some tires.\u201d This is where I got pissed off \u201cFirst of all\u201d I said \u201c you are not my boss, I\u2019m the one running this place and I sign your paychecks so if anyone is going to tell someone what to do, it\u2019s going to be me telling you.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not taking orders from a damn kid\u201d he said. \u201c Look, I know it\u2019s hard to take orders from someone that\u2019s young and that is new here but you know what\u2019s harder?\u201dthere was a pause and he said \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d \u201cFeeding your family and paying the bills without a fucking  paycheck.\u201d He just looked at me then when back outside and hasn\u2019t said anything to be since. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at an employee for them disrespecting their boss?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling an employee off. The situation is that the author is 19, managing a gas station, and an older employee is constantly belittling them. The employee tells the author to get off their ass and do real work, which leads to a confrontation where the author fires back about the employee's paycheck.\n\nFirst, the employee's behavior is clearly disrespectful. He's been there 7 years, and when his coworker left, he took over the mechanic work. But he's lashing out at the new manager, which is unprofessional. The author is trying to manage the office and handle paperwork, which is their role as per the grandfather's plan. The employee isn't doing the paperwork, so he's not doing his part. \n\nThe author's response is a direct reaction to the employee's disrespect. They mention that the employee's paycheck is the author's responsibility, which is a strong point. The employee's response, \"I'm not taking orders from a kid,\" shows he's defying authority. The author's retort about paying bills without a paycheck is a valid point because the employee's attitude is affecting the business.\n\nThe key here is whether the author overstepped. The author was defending their role as the manager and asserting authority. The employee's behavior was not just criticism but daily cussing and disrespect. In a workplace, there's a hierarchy, and an employee can't just talk to a manager that way. The author's response was in line with establishing their role and the employee's consequences if he doesn't comply. So the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
