My grandfather owns a full service gas station where we do tires and mechanic work. When I graduate my grandfather offered me the job of managing the place and I said yes. I\u2019m good with working with my hands and enjoy working on cars but my grandfather wanted me to run the office and do all of the paperwork. When it got super busy I would go out and help with changing tires and oil. One of the workers just quit a few months before I got hired, so there was just one man (he is in his late 40s) beside me. This guy has worked here for 7 years and did all of the mechanic work while my grandfather did the office. The employee brags all the time about how he pretty much ran this place when the other worker quit. While I\u2019m taking care of sending out bills and doing other paperwork the guy comes in and start cussing at me telling me to \u201cget off my ass and do some real work for once\u201d. This happens pretty much every day. After 3 months of it I got pissed off. 3 days ago he came in and said \u201cI\u2019ve got 2 cars out here that need tires on them, why don\u2019t you get off your lazy ass and do some manly work.\u201d I responded with \u201cYou always talk about how you ran this place by yourself so why can\u2019t you do it now, I\u2019m sending out the bills for this month.\u201d He replied \u201cFuck the bills, come out here and change some tires.\u201d This is where I got pissed off \u201cFirst of all\u201d I said \u201c you are not my boss, I\u2019m the one running this place and I sign your paychecks so if anyone is going to tell someone what to do, it\u2019s going to be me telling you.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not taking orders from a damn kid\u201d he said. \u201c Look, I know it\u2019s hard to take orders from someone that\u2019s young and that is new here but you know what\u2019s harder?\u201dthere was a pause and he said \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d \u201cFeeding your family and paying the bills without a fucking  paycheck.\u201d He just looked at me then when back outside and hasn\u2019t said anything to be since. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at an employee for them disrespecting their boss?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for reprimanding an employee who was disrespectful. The situation is that the author, who's 19 and newly in charge, is managing a gas station. The employee, a 40-something man who's been there 7 years, has been belittling him and pushing him to do manual work instead of paperwork. The author finally snaps and tells him that feeding the family without a paycheck is harder than taking orders.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is the new manager, so their authority is being challenged by an experienced employee. The employee's behavior sounds disrespectful and insubordinate. The author's response was to assert their authority by pointing out the employee's dependence on the paycheck, which is the author's responsibility to provide. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the employee was being disrespectful. The author's response was a bit harsh, using a swear word, but it's in response to a disrespectful comment. The key points here are the power imbalance and the nature of the conflict. The employee is not the boss, so the author needed to establish control. The response was direct but maybe a bit confrontational. However, given the repeated disrespect, the author's reaction could be seen as justified. \n\nOn the other hand, using a swear word might be seen as unprofessional. But considering the context of the argument and the employee's prior behavior, it might be a reaction to provocation. The author is also young and new to the role, which can make asserting authority difficult. \n\nSo, balancing the disrespectful treatment from the employee against the author's response, I think the author is not in the wrong. They were defending their role and pointing out the employee's reliance on their paycheck, which is a valid point of authority. The answer should be B.\n"
