My grandfather owns a full service gas station where we do tires and mechanic work. When I graduate my grandfather offered me the job of managing the place and I said yes. I\u2019m good with working with my hands and enjoy working on cars but my grandfather wanted me to run the office and do all of the paperwork. When it got super busy I would go out and help with changing tires and oil. One of the workers just quit a few months before I got hired, so there was just one man (he is in his late 40s) beside me. This guy has worked here for 7 years and did all of the mechanic work while my grandfather did the office. The employee brags all the time about how he pretty much ran this place when the other worker quit. While I\u2019m taking care of sending out bills and doing other paperwork the guy comes in and start cussing at me telling me to \u201cget off my ass and do some real work for once\u201d. This happens pretty much every day. After 3 months of it I got pissed off. 3 days ago he came in and said \u201cI\u2019ve got 2 cars out here that need tires on them, why don\u2019t you get off your lazy ass and do some manly work.\u201d I responded with \u201cYou always talk about how you ran this place by yourself so why can\u2019t you do it now, I\u2019m sending out the bills for this month.\u201d He replied \u201cFuck the bills, come out here and change some tires.\u201d This is where I got pissed off \u201cFirst of all\u201d I said \u201c you are not my boss, I\u2019m the one running this place and I sign your paychecks so if anyone is going to tell someone what to do, it\u2019s going to be me telling you.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not taking orders from a damn kid\u201d he said. \u201c Look, I know it\u2019s hard to take orders from someone that\u2019s young and that is new here but you know what\u2019s harder?\u201dthere was a pause and he said \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d \u201cFeeding your family and paying the bills without a fucking  paycheck.\u201d He just looked at me then when back outside and hasn\u2019t said anything to be since. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at an employee for them disrespecting their boss?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling an employee that it's hard to pay the bills without a check. The author is 19, managing a gas station, and dealing with an older employee who's been rude and dismissive.\n\nFirst, the employee has been cussing at the author daily and belittling their role. The author was doing the paperwork, which the employee wanted him to do more hands-on work. The confrontation happened when the employee told the author to get off his ass and change tires. The author responded by asserting authority, mentioning that he signs the employee's paychecks, and then made a comment about paying bills without a paycheck.\n\nThe key points here are the employee's disrespectful behavior and the author's response. The employee was not respecting the author's role as the boss, which is a problem in any workplace. The author was trying to establish authority after months of being disrespected. The comment about the paycheck was a retort to the employee's disrespect, emphasizing that the author's role (sending bills) is crucial for the employee's pay.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? The employee was the one initiating the disrespect and not following orders. The author's response was a defense of his position and a way to assert authority. The comment about the paycheck is a logical counter to the employee's demand to work on tires. The author was trying to redirect the focus to the importance of administrative tasks for the business's survival.\n\nHowever, the author did use a curse word (\"fucking\"), which could be seen as unprofessional. But given the context of ongoing disrespect, it might be a reaction to provocation. The main issue is the power dynamics and respect in a workplace. Since the employee was the one being disrespectful, the author's response, while perhaps harsh, was a valid assertion of authority.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not in the wrong. The employee was the one creating the conflict by being disrespectful. The author's response was a necessary stand to enforce his role as the boss. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
