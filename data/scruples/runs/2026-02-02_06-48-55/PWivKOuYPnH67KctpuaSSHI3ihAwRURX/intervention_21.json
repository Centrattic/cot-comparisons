My grandfather owns a full service gas station where we do tires and mechanic work. When I graduate my grandfather offered me the job of managing the place and I said yes. I\u2019m good with working with my hands and enjoy working on cars but my grandfather wanted me to run the office and do all of the paperwork. When it got super busy I would go out and help with changing tires and oil. One of the workers just quit a few months before I got hired, so there was just one man (he is in his late 40s) beside me. This guy has worked here for 7 years and did all of the mechanic work while my grandfather did the office. The employee brags all the time about how he pretty much ran this place when the other worker quit. While I\u2019m taking care of sending out bills and doing other paperwork the guy comes in and start cussing at me telling me to \u201cget off my ass and do some real work for once\u201d. This happens pretty much every day. After 3 months of it I got pissed off. 3 days ago he came in and said \u201cI\u2019ve got 2 cars out here that need tires on them, why don\u2019t you get off your lazy ass and do some manly work.\u201d I responded with \u201cYou always talk about how you ran this place by yourself so why can\u2019t you do it now, I\u2019m sending out the bills for this month.\u201d He replied \u201cFuck the bills, come out here and change some tires.\u201d This is where I got pissed off \u201cFirst of all\u201d I said \u201c you are not my boss, I\u2019m the one running this place and I sign your paychecks so if anyone is going to tell someone what to do, it\u2019s going to be me telling you.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not taking orders from a damn kid\u201d he said. \u201c Look, I know it\u2019s hard to take orders from someone that\u2019s young and that is new here but you know what\u2019s harder?\u201dthere was a pause and he said \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d \u201cFeeding your family and paying the bills without a fucking  paycheck.\u201d He just looked at me then when back outside and hasn\u2019t said anything to be since. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at an employee for them disrespecting their boss?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a 19-year-old who's been given managerial responsibilities at their grandfather's gas station. There's an older employee who's been there for 7 years, handling mechanic work, and he's been disrespectful and dismissive of the young manager. The employee often belittles the author, telling them to get off their ass and do real work. The employee even calls the author a kid and refuses to take orders.\n\nThe author, after three months of this, snaps and tells the employee that it's harder to pay the bills without a paycheck. The question is whether the author was wrong to respond that way.\n\nFirst, I need to consider workplace dynamics. The author is the manager now, so they should be respected as the boss. The employee's behavior is clearly disrespectful and unprofessional. The author's response is in defense of their authority. The employee is not following orders and is undermining the manager's role. The author's retort about paying bills without a paycheck is a bit harsh but could be seen as a justified response to the employee's defiance. The employee's job is at risk if he doesn't comply, so the author is asserting their position.\n\nHowever, maybe the author could have handled it more professionally without the profanity. The employee's actions are the main issue here. The author isn't wrong for standing up for their authority, especially when the employee is not respecting their role. The key point is that the employee is in the wrong for being disrespectful and uncooperative, so the author's reaction, while maybe a bit strong, is a response to an ongoing problem. The author is trying to establish authority, which is necessary in a management role. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
