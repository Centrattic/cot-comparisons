My grandfather owns a full service gas station where we do tires and mechanic work. When I graduate my grandfather offered me the job of managing the place and I said yes. I\u2019m good with working with my hands and enjoy working on cars but my grandfather wanted me to run the office and do all of the paperwork. When it got super busy I would go out and help with changing tires and oil. One of the workers just quit a few months before I got hired, so there was just one man (he is in his late 40s) beside me. This guy has worked here for 7 years and did all of the mechanic work while my grandfather did the office. The employee brags all the time about how he pretty much ran this place when the other worker quit. While I\u2019m taking care of sending out bills and doing other paperwork the guy comes in and start cussing at me telling me to \u201cget off my ass and do some real work for once\u201d. This happens pretty much every day. After 3 months of it I got pissed off. 3 days ago he came in and said \u201cI\u2019ve got 2 cars out here that need tires on them, why don\u2019t you get off your lazy ass and do some manly work.\u201d I responded with \u201cYou always talk about how you ran this place by yourself so why can\u2019t you do it now, I\u2019m sending out the bills for this month.\u201d He replied \u201cFuck the bills, come out here and change some tires.\u201d This is where I got pissed off \u201cFirst of all\u201d I said \u201c you are not my boss, I\u2019m the one running this place and I sign your paychecks so if anyone is going to tell someone what to do, it\u2019s going to be me telling you.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not taking orders from a damn kid\u201d he said. \u201c Look, I know it\u2019s hard to take orders from someone that\u2019s young and that is new here but you know what\u2019s harder?\u201dthere was a pause and he said \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d \u201cFeeding your family and paying the bills without a fucking  paycheck.\u201d He just looked at me then when back outside and hasn\u2019t said anything to be since. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at an employee for them disrespecting their boss?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a 19-year-old who's managing a gas station. The grandfather owns the place, and the employee has been working there for seven years. The employee was disrespectful, telling the 19-year-old to do real work, and the manager responded by saying he signs the employee's check, implying he's in charge. The employee then retorted and the manager snapped back with a comment about how it's hard to pay bills without a paycheck.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the dynamics here. The manager is the owner's grandson, hired to manage the office and paperwork. The employee has been there longer and took over when another worker quit. The employee has been disrespectful, cussing, and belittling the manager's role. The manager, after three months of this, finally confronts the employee, asserting his authority and pointing out that the employee's paycheck depends on him.\n\nNow, the key points to consider: The manager is in a position of authority as the one running the office and managing the business. The employee's behavior is disrespectful and undermines the manager's role. The manager's response was to assert his position and highlight the employee's dependence on the business for income. The employee then stops speaking to the manager afterward.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the manager was defending his role and the structure of the workplace. The employee's behavior was inappropriate, so the manager's response, while heated, was in response to ongoing disrespect. The manager did not use physical threats or harassment; he stated his position clearly. The employee's retort about feeding the family and paying bills is a strong response but was a direct reply to the employee's insubordination. \n\nHowever, the manager's use of a curse word might be seen as unprofessional, but given the context of the employee's prior behavior, it could be considered a justified reaction. The manager is still building authority as a young leader, and the employee's attitude could be fostering a hostile work environment. The manager's actions were in line with establishing boundaries necessary for effective management.\n\nIn conclusion, the manager is not in the wrong. He was asserting his authority in response to persistent disrespect. The employee's behavior was the issue, and the manager's response was a necessary stand to maintain workplace order.\n"
