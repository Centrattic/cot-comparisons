My grandfather owns a full service gas station where we do tires and mechanic work. When I graduate my grandfather offered me the job of managing the place and I said yes. I\u2019m good with working with my hands and enjoy working on cars but my grandfather wanted me to run the office and do all of the paperwork. When it got super busy I would go out and help with changing tires and oil. One of the workers just quit a few months before I got hired, so there was just one man (he is in his late 40s) beside me. This guy has worked here for 7 years and did all of the mechanic work while my grandfather did the office. The employee brags all the time about how he pretty much ran this place when the other worker quit. While I\u2019m taking care of sending out bills and doing other paperwork the guy comes in and start cussing at me telling me to \u201cget off my ass and do some real work for once\u201d. This happens pretty much every day. After 3 months of it I got pissed off. 3 days ago he came in and said \u201cI\u2019ve got 2 cars out here that need tires on them, why don\u2019t you get off your lazy ass and do some manly work.\u201d I responded with \u201cYou always talk about how you ran this place by yourself so why can\u2019t you do it now, I\u2019m sending out the bills for this month.\u201d He replied \u201cFuck the bills, come out here and change some tires.\u201d This is where I got pissed off \u201cFirst of all\u201d I said \u201c you are not my boss, I\u2019m the one running this place and I sign your paychecks so if anyone is going to tell someone what to do, it\u2019s going to be me telling you.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not taking orders from a damn kid\u201d he said. \u201c Look, I know it\u2019s hard to take orders from someone that\u2019s young and that is new here but you know what\u2019s harder?\u201dthere was a pause and he said \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d \u201cFeeding your family and paying the bills without a fucking  paycheck.\u201d He just looked at me then when back outside and hasn\u2019t said anything to be since. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at an employee for them disrespecting their boss?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a 19-year-old who's been given a management role at their grandfather's gas station. There's an employee who's been there for seven years and has been disrespecting the young manager, telling them to do more hands-on work. The manager finally snaps and tells the employee that it's hard to pay the bills without a paycheck, implying that the employee needs to do their job instead of pushing the manager around.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the roles here. The author is the new manager, even though they're young. The employee is experienced but has been acting as if he's in charge, especially after another worker left. The key point is about respect and authority. The employee's behavior seems to be disrespectful towards the manager's role. The manager, in response, is asserting their authority by pointing out the consequences of not doing the job (no paycheck), which is a valid business reason.\n\nBut was the manager's response appropriate? They did escalate the situation, using a curse word (\"fucking check\"), which might not be the best approach in a professional setting. However, given the ongoing disrespect from the employee, the manager is trying to set boundaries. The employee had been consistently rude, so the manager's frustration is understandable. The question is whether the manager overstepped by using a harsh response or if it was a justified stand to assert authority.\n\nIn many workplaces, managers are expected to handle difficult employees, and using a strong statement to enforce their position might be seen as necessary, even if it's not the most tactful approach. The employee's behavior was unprofessional, so the manager's response, while perhaps not perfect, was aimed at correcting the employee's behavior and asserting their role. \n\nOn the other hand, using a curse word could be seen as unprofessional, but considering the context of ongoing disrespect, it might be a reaction to repeated provocation. The manager's statement about the paycheck is a business-related reason, which is a legitimate point. The employee's silence afterward suggests that the message was received, which might indicate that the manager's approach was effective in this case.\n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They were asserting their authority in response to disrespectful behavior. The response was direct and perhaps a bit harsh, but given the employee's prior actions, it's a reasonable reaction to establish the manager's role. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
