My grandfather owns a full service gas station where we do tires and mechanic work. When I graduate my grandfather offered me the job of managing the place and I said yes. I\u2019m good with working with my hands and enjoy working on cars but my grandfather wanted me to run the office and do all of the paperwork. When it got super busy I would go out and help with changing tires and oil. One of the workers just quit a few months before I got hired, so there was just one man (he is in his late 40s) beside me. This guy has worked here for 7 years and did all of the mechanic work while my grandfather did the office. The employee brags all the time about how he pretty much ran this place when the other worker quit. While I\u2019m taking care of sending out bills and doing other paperwork the guy comes in and start cussing at me telling me to \u201cget off my ass and do some real work for once\u201d. This happens pretty much every day. After 3 months of it I got pissed off. 3 days ago he came in and said \u201cI\u2019ve got 2 cars out here that need tires on them, why don\u2019t you get off your lazy ass and do some manly work.\u201d I responded with \u201cYou always talk about how you ran this place by yourself so why can\u2019t you do it now, I\u2019m sending out the bills for this month.\u201d He replied \u201cFuck the bills, come out here and change some tires.\u201d This is where I got pissed off \u201cFirst of all\u201d I said \u201c you are not my boss, I\u2019m the one running this place and I sign your paychecks so if anyone is going to tell someone what to do, it\u2019s going to be me telling you.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not taking orders from a damn kid\u201d he said. \u201c Look, I know it\u2019s hard to take orders from someone that\u2019s young and that is new here but you know what\u2019s harder?\u201dthere was a pause and he said \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d \u201cFeeding your family and paying the bills without a fucking  paycheck.\u201d He just looked at me then when back outside and hasn\u2019t said anything to be since. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at an employee for them disrespecting their boss?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for responding to an employee's disrespect.\n\nThe situation: The author, who is 19, is managing a gas station. The employee, a 40-something with 7 years of tenure, has been rude and dismissive, telling the author to do \"real work\" and not get caught up in paperwork. The author finally snaps and tells the employee that it's hard to pay the bills without a paycheck, implying the employee needs to do their job to get paid. The employee then shuts up and hasn't spoken to the author since.\n\nFirst, the employee's behavior seems unprofessional. Insulting a boss and questioning their authority is generally not acceptable. The author is the manager, even if young, and the employee shouldn't be cussing or challenging their authority. The author was doing their job (handling bills and paperwork), which is part of running the business. The employee's job is to do the mechanic work. When the employee refused to do their part and instead mocked the author, the author had the right to assert their authority.\n\nThe author's response was firm but not necessarily abusive. Using strong language (\"feeding your family and paying the bills without a fucking paycheck\") could be seen as a bit harsh, but it's a direct response to the employee's disrespect. However, the employee's behavior was the root issue. The author was defending their role and trying to make the employee do their job. The employee then stopped communicating, which might indicate they realized the author was in charge, but it's also possible of passive-aggressive behavior.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the employee's actions were inappropriate. The author had the right to correct the employee's behavior and reinforce their position as the boss. The author's response was a justified defense of their authority, especially given the ongoing disrespect. The author isn't in the wrong here because they were standing up for themselves and fulfilling their managerial role. The employee was the one who needed to follow orders. So, the answer is B.\n"
