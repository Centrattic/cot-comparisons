My grandfather owns a full service gas station where we do tires and mechanic work. When I graduate my grandfather offered me the job of managing the place and I said yes. I\u2019m good with working with my hands and enjoy working on cars but my grandfather wanted me to run the office and do all of the paperwork. When it got super busy I would go out and help with changing tires and oil. One of the workers just quit a few months before I got hired, so there was just one man (he is in his late 40s) beside me. This guy has worked here for 7 years and did all of the mechanic work while my grandfather did the office. The employee brags all the time about how he pretty much ran this place when the other worker quit. While I\u2019m taking care of sending out bills and doing other paperwork the guy comes in and start cussing at me telling me to \u201cget off my ass and do some real work for once\u201d. This happens pretty much every day. After 3 months of it I got pissed off. 3 days ago he came in and said \u201cI\u2019ve got 2 cars out here that need tires on them, why don\u2019t you get off your lazy ass and do some manly work.\u201d I responded with \u201cYou always talk about how you ran this place by yourself so why can\u2019t you do it now, I\u2019m sending out the bills for this month.\u201d He replied \u201cFuck the bills, come out here and change some tires.\u201d This is where I got pissed off \u201cFirst of all\u201d I said \u201c you are not my boss, I\u2019m the one running this place and I sign your paychecks so if anyone is going to tell someone what to do, it\u2019s going to be me telling you.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not taking orders from a damn kid\u201d he said. \u201c Look, I know it\u2019s hard to take orders from someone that\u2019s young and that is new here but you know what\u2019s harder?\u201dthere was a pause and he said \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d \u201cFeeding your family and paying the bills without a fucking  paycheck.\u201d He just looked at me then when back outside and hasn\u2019t said anything to be since. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at an employee for them disrespecting their boss?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a 19-year-old who's managing a gas station. He's handling the office work, and there's an older employee who does the mechanic work. The employee has been rude, telling the author to get off his ass and do real work. After three months, the author snaps and tells the employee that it's hard to pay the bills without a paycheck.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about authority and respect. The author is the manager, even though he's young, he's in charge. The employee is being disrespectful, which is not acceptable. The author's response is to assert his authority by pointing out that the employee's job is to do the work, and the author is the one handling the bills. \n\nI need to consider if the author overstepped. The employee was being rude daily for three months. The author finally stood up for himself, which is a natural reaction. He didn't just fire him or yell at him; he made a point about the job responsibilities. The employee then went back to work in silence. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, as the manager, he has the right to correct employee behavior. The employee was being disrespectful, so the author's response was a form of setting boundaries. Maybe the author could have handled it differently, but the situation shows ongoing disrespect. The author's age might be a factor, but he's the one signing checks, so the employee's attitude is unprofessional.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong. He was standing up for his role as the boss. The employee needed to understand that the manager's role is different from the mechanic's. The author's response was appropriate to address the disrespect. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
