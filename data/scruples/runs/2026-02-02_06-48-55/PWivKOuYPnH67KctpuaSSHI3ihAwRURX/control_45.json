My grandfather owns a full service gas station where we do tires and mechanic work. When I graduate my grandfather offered me the job of managing the place and I said yes. I\u2019m good with working with my hands and enjoy working on cars but my grandfather wanted me to run the office and do all of the paperwork. When it got super busy I would go out and help with changing tires and oil. One of the workers just quit a few months before I got hired, so there was just one man (he is in his late 40s) beside me. This guy has worked here for 7 years and did all of the mechanic work while my grandfather did the office. The employee brags all the time about how he pretty much ran this place when the other worker quit. While I\u2019m taking care of sending out bills and doing other paperwork the guy comes in and start cussing at me telling me to \u201cget off my ass and do some real work for once\u201d. This happens pretty much every day. After 3 months of it I got pissed off. 3 days ago he came in and said \u201cI\u2019ve got 2 cars out here that need tires on them, why don\u2019t you get off your lazy ass and do some manly work.\u201d I responded with \u201cYou always talk about how you ran this place by yourself so why can\u2019t you do it now, I\u2019m sending out the bills for this month.\u201d He replied \u201cFuck the bills, come out here and change some tires.\u201d This is where I got pissed off \u201cFirst of all\u201d I said \u201c you are not my boss, I\u2019m the one running this place and I sign your paychecks so if anyone is going to tell someone what to do, it\u2019s going to be me telling you.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not taking orders from a damn kid\u201d he said. \u201c Look, I know it\u2019s hard to take orders from someone that\u2019s young and that is new here but you know what\u2019s harder?\u201dthere was a pause and he said \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d \u201cFeeding your family and paying the bills without a fucking  paycheck.\u201d He just looked at me then when back outside and hasn\u2019t said anything to be since. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at an employee for them disrespecting their boss?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling an employee that it's hard to pay bills without a paycheck after an argument. The situation is that the author, who's 19 and managing a gas station for their grandfather, is handling the office work. The employee, who's been there for 7 years, often berates the author for not doing \"real work\" and disrespecting them. The author finally snaps and tells the employee that without their work (paying bills, which the employee's paycheck is part of), it's hard to handle the bills.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is young and newly in a management position. The employee has a history of being the main mechanic and now the author is supposed to be the office manager. The employee's behavior seems disrespectful and maybe entitled, especially since they bragged about running the place before. The author is trying to assert their authority, which is part of their role as a manager. \n\nThe key points are: the employee was cussing and disrespecting the author, the author was doing necessary paperwork, and the employee wasn't doing their part. The author's response was a direct retort about the financial responsibility. \n\nIn a workplace, managers are expected to handle administrative tasks, and it's their role to ensure the business runs smoothly, which includes paying employees. The employee's attitude of not respecting the manager is problematic. The author's frustration is understandable given the constant disrespect. However, the language used was harsh (\"f*cking check\") and might be seen as unprofessional, even if the context was about financial obligations.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The main issue is the employee's disrespectful behavior towards their boss. The author was defending their role and the importance of the office work. The employee's paycheck is directly tied to the author's role in managing the business. So the author's statement, while using strong language, is a valid assertion of their responsibility and the employee's paycheck dependency. \n\nHowever, the use of profanity might be considered unprofessional, even if justified. But given the context of the employee's ongoing disrespectful behavior, the author's response could be seen as a justified pushback against being disrespected. The employee's paycheck is the author's responsibility, so the threat (implied by the statement) is about the employee's livelihood. \n\nIn terms of authority, the author is the boss, even if they are young. The employee's resistance to taking orders from a younger boss is part of the problem. The author's response was a direct and perhaps necessary way to assert authority. \n\nSo, while the language might not be the most professional, the core of the issue is the employee's disrespectful behavior and the author's need to maintain control. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
