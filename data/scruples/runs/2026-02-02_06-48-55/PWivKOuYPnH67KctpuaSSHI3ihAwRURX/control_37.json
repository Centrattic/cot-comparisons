My grandfather owns a full service gas station where we do tires and mechanic work. When I graduate my grandfather offered me the job of managing the place and I said yes. I\u2019m good with working with my hands and enjoy working on cars but my grandfather wanted me to run the office and do all of the paperwork. When it got super busy I would go out and help with changing tires and oil. One of the workers just quit a few months before I got hired, so there was just one man (he is in his late 40s) beside me. This guy has worked here for 7 years and did all of the mechanic work while my grandfather did the office. The employee brags all the time about how he pretty much ran this place when the other worker quit. While I\u2019m taking care of sending out bills and doing other paperwork the guy comes in and start cussing at me telling me to \u201cget off my ass and do some real work for once\u201d. This happens pretty much every day. After 3 months of it I got pissed off. 3 days ago he came in and said \u201cI\u2019ve got 2 cars out here that need tires on them, why don\u2019t you get off your lazy ass and do some manly work.\u201d I responded with \u201cYou always talk about how you ran this place by yourself so why can\u2019t you do it now, I\u2019m sending out the bills for this month.\u201d He replied \u201cFuck the bills, come out here and change some tires.\u201d This is where I got pissed off \u201cFirst of all\u201d I said \u201c you are not my boss, I\u2019m the one running this place and I sign your paychecks so if anyone is going to tell someone what to do, it\u2019s going to be me telling you.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not taking orders from a damn kid\u201d he said. \u201c Look, I know it\u2019s hard to take orders from someone that\u2019s young and that is new here but you know what\u2019s harder?\u201dthere was a pause and he said \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d \u201cFeeding your family and paying the bills without a fucking  paycheck.\u201d He just looked at me then when back outside and hasn\u2019t said anything to be since. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at an employee for them disrespecting their boss?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling an employee that it's hard to pay the bills without a check. The situation is that the author, who's 19 and managing a gas station, is dealing with a 40-something employee who's been there for 7 years. The employee has been disrespectful, telling the author to \"get off my ass\" and do real work. The author confronts him, mentions that he signs his paycheck, and then says that feeding the family without a paycheck is hard.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The employee was being disrespectful and not following orders. The author is the new manager, albeit young, and is trying to assert authority. The employee's attitude is probably causing tension. The author's response is emotional, using a swear word, but it's in the context of standing up for their role as a boss. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the employee was being rude and uncooperative. The author was defending their position and the reality of the situation\u2014without timely work, there are no bills paid, hence the employee's paycheck is at risk. The author's response, while maybe a bit harsh in language, seems to be a reaction to ongoing disrespect. \n\nBut wait, the author is the one who's in charge, so using strong language might not be appropriate. However, given the employee's constant disrespect, maybe the author's frustration is justified. The key here is whether the author overstepped. The employee was not respecting the new management, and the author was asserting authority. The line about paying the bills without a check is more about the consequence of not doing the work\u2014without the work (i.e., the employee doing his job), the business can't pay the bills, hence his paycheck. \n\nSo, in this case, the author isn't in the wrong. The employee was the one being rude and uncooperative. The author's response was a firm assertion of their role as the boss, even if it included a swear word. The situation shows that the employee needed to be reminded of his place, and the author did so. So the answer should be B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
