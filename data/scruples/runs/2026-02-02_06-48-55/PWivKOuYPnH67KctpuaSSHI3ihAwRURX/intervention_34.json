My grandfather owns a full service gas station where we do tires and mechanic work. When I graduate my grandfather offered me the job of managing the place and I said yes. I\u2019m good with working with my hands and enjoy working on cars but my grandfather wanted me to run the office and do all of the paperwork. When it got super busy I would go out and help with changing tires and oil. One of the workers just quit a few months before I got hired, so there was just one man (he is in his late 40s) beside me. This guy has worked here for 7 years and did all of the mechanic work while my grandfather did the office. The employee brags all the time about how he pretty much ran this place when the other worker quit. While I\u2019m taking care of sending out bills and doing other paperwork the guy comes in and start cussing at me telling me to \u201cget off my ass and do some real work for once\u201d. This happens pretty much every day. After 3 months of it I got pissed off. 3 days ago he came in and said \u201cI\u2019ve got 2 cars out here that need tires on them, why don\u2019t you get off your lazy ass and do some manly work.\u201d I responded with \u201cYou always talk about how you ran this place by yourself so why can\u2019t you do it now, I\u2019m sending out the bills for this month.\u201d He replied \u201cFuck the bills, come out here and change some tires.\u201d This is where I got pissed off \u201cFirst of all\u201d I said \u201c you are not my boss, I\u2019m the one running this place and I sign your paychecks so if anyone is going to tell someone what to do, it\u2019s going to be me telling you.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not taking orders from a damn kid\u201d he said. \u201c Look, I know it\u2019s hard to take orders from someone that\u2019s young and that is new here but you know what\u2019s harder?\u201dthere was a pause and he said \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d \u201cFeeding your family and paying the bills without a fucking  paycheck.\u201d He just looked at me then when back outside and hasn\u2019t said anything to be since. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at an employee for them disrespecting their boss?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their employee that it's hard to pay the bills without a paycheck. The situation involves a 19-year-old who was given the job of managing their grandfather's gas station. The grandfather is the owner, and the employee in question has been there for 7 years. The employee has been disrespecting the author, telling them to get off their ass and do real work. The author finally snaps and tells the employee that feeding their family is harder than getting a paycheck from the employee. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the roles here. The author is the new manager, even though they're young. The employee is experienced but has been showing disrespect. The grandfather is the owner, so the author's authority comes from him. The employee's comments about the author not doing real work might be insubordinate. \n\nThe author's response was to confront the employee by saying that paying bills without a paycheck is hard. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. \n\nThe employee's behavior seems unprofessional and disrespectful. He's been there longer but that doesn't justify his attitude. The author is the manager now, so the employee should respect that role. The author's retort, while maybe harsh, is a response to ongoing disrespect. The key here is whether the author overstepped in their response. \n\nThe author's statement about the paycheck implies that the employee's paycheck depends on the author's work (managing and sending bills), which is a valid point. The employee's job is to do the mechanic work, and if he's not doing it, the business suffers. The author is also pointing out that the employee's paycheck is a result of the author's efforts. \n\nBut maybe the author could have handled it more professionally. Using a curse word might have been unwise, but the core message is about the employee's dependence on the author's role. The employee's refusal to follow the manager's lead could lead to a hostile work environment. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they were asserting their authority as the manager. The employee's behavior was unprofessional, and the author's response, while blunt, was a justified stand to establish boundaries. The grandfather gave the author the position, so the employee's disrespect isn't acceptable. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
