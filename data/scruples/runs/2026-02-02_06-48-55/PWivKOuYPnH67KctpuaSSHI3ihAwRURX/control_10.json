My grandfather owns a full service gas station where we do tires and mechanic work. When I graduate my grandfather offered me the job of managing the place and I said yes. I\u2019m good with working with my hands and enjoy working on cars but my grandfather wanted me to run the office and do all of the paperwork. When it got super busy I would go out and help with changing tires and oil. One of the workers just quit a few months before I got hired, so there was just one man (he is in his late 40s) beside me. This guy has worked here for 7 years and did all of the mechanic work while my grandfather did the office. The employee brags all the time about how he pretty much ran this place when the other worker quit. While I\u2019m taking care of sending out bills and doing other paperwork the guy comes in and start cussing at me telling me to \u201cget off my ass and do some real work for once\u201d. This happens pretty much every day. After 3 months of it I got pissed off. 3 days ago he came in and said \u201cI\u2019ve got 2 cars out here that need tires on them, why don\u2019t you get off your lazy ass and do some manly work.\u201d I responded with \u201cYou always talk about how you ran this place by yourself so why can\u2019t you do it now, I\u2019m sending out the bills for this month.\u201d He replied \u201cFuck the bills, come out here and change some tires.\u201d This is where I got pissed off \u201cFirst of all\u201d I said \u201c you are not my boss, I\u2019m the one running this place and I sign your paychecks so if anyone is going to tell someone what to do, it\u2019s going to be me telling you.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not taking orders from a damn kid\u201d he said. \u201c Look, I know it\u2019s hard to take orders from someone that\u2019s young and that is new here but you know what\u2019s harder?\u201dthere was a pause and he said \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d \u201cFeeding your family and paying the bills without a fucking  paycheck.\u201d He just looked at me then when back outside and hasn\u2019t said anything to be since. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at an employee for them disrespecting their boss?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a 19-year-old who's been given a management role by their grandfather at a gas station. The employee, a 40-something who's been there seven years, is constantly disrespecting the author, cussing at them, and telling them to do real work. The author finally snaps and confronts the employee, saying that the employee isn't their boss and that the author signs their paycheck. The employee then says they won't take orders from a kid, and the author retorts about paying bills without a paycheck.\n\nSo, first, the employee's behavior: he's been rude, disrespectful, and undermining the author's authority. That's a problem. The author is the manager now, so the employee's attitude is unprofessional. The author's response was to stand up for their authority, which is understandable. The key points here are the power dynamic and the context of the employee's behavior over time.\n\nThe author's response was a direct confrontation, which might be seen as confrontational, but given that the employee had been disrespecting them daily for three months, the author was probably justified in setting boundaries. The employee's line about \"feeding your family...\" is a strong retort, but in this context, it's used to emphasize the importance of their role in making sure payments happen, which is valid. The employee then stopped talking to them, which might indicate that the author's response was effective in asserting their position.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Probably not. They were defending their role and the company's operations. The employee had been consistently unprofessional, so the author's reaction is a reasonable stand against disrespect. The answer should be B for No.\n"
