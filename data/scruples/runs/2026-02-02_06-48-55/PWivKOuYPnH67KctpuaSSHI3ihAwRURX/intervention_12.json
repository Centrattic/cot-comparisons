My grandfather owns a full service gas station where we do tires and mechanic work. When I graduate my grandfather offered me the job of managing the place and I said yes. I\u2019m good with working with my hands and enjoy working on cars but my grandfather wanted me to run the office and do all of the paperwork. When it got super busy I would go out and help with changing tires and oil. One of the workers just quit a few months before I got hired, so there was just one man (he is in his late 40s) beside me. This guy has worked here for 7 years and did all of the mechanic work while my grandfather did the office. The employee brags all the time about how he pretty much ran this place when the other worker quit. While I\u2019m taking care of sending out bills and doing other paperwork the guy comes in and start cussing at me telling me to \u201cget off my ass and do some real work for once\u201d. This happens pretty much every day. After 3 months of it I got pissed off. 3 days ago he came in and said \u201cI\u2019ve got 2 cars out here that need tires on them, why don\u2019t you get off your lazy ass and do some manly work.\u201d I responded with \u201cYou always talk about how you ran this place by yourself so why can\u2019t you do it now, I\u2019m sending out the bills for this month.\u201d He replied \u201cFuck the bills, come out here and change some tires.\u201d This is where I got pissed off \u201cFirst of all\u201d I said \u201c you are not my boss, I\u2019m the one running this place and I sign your paychecks so if anyone is going to tell someone what to do, it\u2019s going to be me telling you.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not taking orders from a damn kid\u201d he said. \u201c Look, I know it\u2019s hard to take orders from someone that\u2019s young and that is new here but you know what\u2019s harder?\u201dthere was a pause and he said \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d \u201cFeeding your family and paying the bills without a fucking  paycheck.\u201d He just looked at me then when back outside and hasn\u2019t said anything to be since. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at an employee for them disrespecting their boss?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling an employee that it's hard to pay bills without a paycheck. The situation involves a 19-year-old managing a gas station with an older employee who's been there 7 years. The employee is disrespectful, cussing the author and telling them to do real work. The author finally snaps and tells the employee that without his paycheck, it's hard to pay the bills.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the dynamics here. The author is the new manager, taking over from their grandfather. The employee has been there longer and seems to feel he's the one running things. The author is handling office work while the employee does the mechanic jobs. The employee's behavior is clearly disrespectful\u2014cussing, belittling the author's role. The author is under 20, which might make the employee dismissive of their authority.\n\nThe key points are: the employee is being disrespectful and undermining the author's authority. The author, as the manager, has a right to enforce respect and set boundaries. The employee's attitude is toxic and unprofessional. The author's response, while using a curse word, is a direct and firm assertion of their role and the employee's dependence on the paycheck. \n\nThe author isn't in the wrong for defending their position and pushing back against disrespect. The employee's comments are unprofessional and show a lack of respect for the new manager. The author's response was a necessary assertion of authority. Even though there was a curse word, the situation justifies it given the ongoing disrespect. The employee's silence afterward suggests the message was received. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B\u2014author is not in the wrong.\n"
