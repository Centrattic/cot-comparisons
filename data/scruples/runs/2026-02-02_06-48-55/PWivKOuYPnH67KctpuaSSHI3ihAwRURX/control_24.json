My grandfather owns a full service gas station where we do tires and mechanic work. When I graduate my grandfather offered me the job of managing the place and I said yes. I\u2019m good with working with my hands and enjoy working on cars but my grandfather wanted me to run the office and do all of the paperwork. When it got super busy I would go out and help with changing tires and oil. One of the workers just quit a few months before I got hired, so there was just one man (he is in his late 40s) beside me. This guy has worked here for 7 years and did all of the mechanic work while my grandfather did the office. The employee brags all the time about how he pretty much ran this place when the other worker quit. While I\u2019m taking care of sending out bills and doing other paperwork the guy comes in and start cussing at me telling me to \u201cget off my ass and do some real work for once\u201d. This happens pretty much every day. After 3 months of it I got pissed off. 3 days ago he came in and said \u201cI\u2019ve got 2 cars out here that need tires on them, why don\u2019t you get off your lazy ass and do some manly work.\u201d I responded with \u201cYou always talk about how you ran this place by yourself so why can\u2019t you do it now, I\u2019m sending out the bills for this month.\u201d He replied \u201cFuck the bills, come out here and change some tires.\u201d This is where I got pissed off \u201cFirst of all\u201d I said \u201c you are not my boss, I\u2019m the one running this place and I sign your paychecks so if anyone is going to tell someone what to do, it\u2019s going to be me telling you.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not taking orders from a damn kid\u201d he said. \u201c Look, I know it\u2019s hard to take orders from someone that\u2019s young and that is new here but you know what\u2019s harder?\u201dthere was a pause and he said \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d \u201cFeeding your family and paying the bills without a fucking  paycheck.\u201d He just looked at me then when back outside and hasn\u2019t said anything to be since. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at an employee for them disrespecting their boss?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for responding angrily to an employee's disrespect. \n\nFirst, the context: The author is 19, managing a gas station. The grandfather is the owner, but the author is handling the office work. The employee, who's been there 7 years, has been cussing at the author and telling him to do \"real work.\" The employee has a history of taking over when the other worker quit, which might contribute to his attitude. The author finally snaps after the employee dismisses the importance of bills and tells him to change tires. The author retorts with a comment about feeding the family without a paycheck, leading to silence from the employee.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics. The employee has been disrespectful and undermining the author's authority. The author is in a position of power as the manager, but he's young and new to the role. The employee's behavior is unprofessional and possibly toxic. The author's response was a firm assertion of his authority. The key points here are: the employee's prior disrespect, the author's role as the manager, and the appropriate response when being disrespected.\n\nThe author's retort is direct but not overly harsh. He's defending his role and the importance of his duties (paying bills). The employee's job is to do the mechanic work, so the author is emphasizing that the employee's paycheck depends on him. The confrontation led to the employee shutting up, which might indicate the author's response was necessary to establish boundaries. \n\nIn terms of workplace hierarchy, the manager has the right to assert authority. The employee's behavior is inappropriate, so the author isn't in the wrong for standing up for himself. The response was proportional to the disrespect and served to clarify the power dynamic. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
