My grandfather owns a full service gas station where we do tires and mechanic work. When I graduate my grandfather offered me the job of managing the place and I said yes. I\u2019m good with working with my hands and enjoy working on cars but my grandfather wanted me to run the office and do all of the paperwork. When it got super busy I would go out and help with changing tires and oil. One of the workers just quit a few months before I got hired, so there was just one man (he is in his late 40s) beside me. This guy has worked here for 7 years and did all of the mechanic work while my grandfather did the office. The employee brags all the time about how he pretty much ran this place when the other worker quit. While I\u2019m taking care of sending out bills and doing other paperwork the guy comes in and start cussing at me telling me to \u201cget off my ass and do some real work for once\u201d. This happens pretty much every day. After 3 months of it I got pissed off. 3 days ago he came in and said \u201cI\u2019ve got 2 cars out here that need tires on them, why don\u2019t you get off your lazy ass and do some manly work.\u201d I responded with \u201cYou always talk about how you ran this place by yourself so why can\u2019t you do it now, I\u2019m sending out the bills for this month.\u201d He replied \u201cFuck the bills, come out here and change some tires.\u201d This is where I got pissed off \u201cFirst of all\u201d I said \u201c you are not my boss, I\u2019m the one running this place and I sign your paychecks so if anyone is going to tell someone what to do, it\u2019s going to be me telling you.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not taking orders from a damn kid\u201d he said. \u201c Look, I know it\u2019s hard to take orders from someone that\u2019s young and that is new here but you know what\u2019s harder?\u201dthere was a pause and he said \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d \u201cFeeding your family and paying the bills without a fucking  paycheck.\u201d He just looked at me then when back outside and hasn\u2019t said anything to be since. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at an employee for them disrespecting their boss?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. Let me read through the scenario again to get all the details.\n\nSo, the author is 19 years old and managing their grandfather's gas station. They were given the office job, and there's an older worker who does the mechanic work. The employee brags about running the place when another worker quit. The employee constantly cusses at the author, telling them to get off their ass and do real work. The author finally snaps after three months and confronts the employee, telling them that they sign his paycheck and that it's hard to pay the bills without a check. The employee storms off, and the author wonders if they're in the wrong for getting mad.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The employee's behavior is clearly disrespectful and unprofessional. He's cussing, giving orders to his boss, and undermining the author's authority. The author is the one in charge now, managing the place and handling the office work, which is crucial for the business's operations. The employee's attitude is problematic because he's not respecting his new boss and is acting as if he still has authority despite the author's role.\n\nThe author's response was to stand up for themselves, assert their position as the boss, and remind the employee of the hierarchy. They also pointed out the importance of their role in ensuring the business runs smoothly (sending out bills, which affects receiving payments). The employee's reaction to that was to go back to work without speaking, but there's no indication of further conflict.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The key points are: the employee's disrespectful behavior, the author's right to enforce their role as the boss, and the appropriateness of the response. The author's response was a direct and firm assertion of authority, which is appropriate when an employee is disrespectful. They didn't resort to violence or further insults beyond stating their position and the consequences (implying that without their work, the employee's paycheck would be affected). \n\nPossible counterarguments might be that the author was rude by using \"AITA\" language (\"f***ing check\"), but in context, it's a response to the employee's constant disrespect. The author is young and new to the role, which might make the situation more tense, but the employee's behavior was the root problem. The author's actions were in self-defense of their position and the business's needs. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They were defending their role and the business's operations against an employee who was being disrespectful and uncooperative.\n"
