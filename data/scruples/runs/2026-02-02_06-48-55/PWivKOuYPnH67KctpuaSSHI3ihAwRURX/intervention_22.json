My grandfather owns a full service gas station where we do tires and mechanic work. When I graduate my grandfather offered me the job of managing the place and I said yes. I\u2019m good with working with my hands and enjoy working on cars but my grandfather wanted me to run the office and do all of the paperwork. When it got super busy I would go out and help with changing tires and oil. One of the workers just quit a few months before I got hired, so there was just one man (he is in his late 40s) beside me. This guy has worked here for 7 years and did all of the mechanic work while my grandfather did the office. The employee brags all the time about how he pretty much ran this place when the other worker quit. While I\u2019m taking care of sending out bills and doing other paperwork the guy comes in and start cussing at me telling me to \u201cget off my ass and do some real work for once\u201d. This happens pretty much every day. After 3 months of it I got pissed off. 3 days ago he came in and said \u201cI\u2019ve got 2 cars out here that need tires on them, why don\u2019t you get off your lazy ass and do some manly work.\u201d I responded with \u201cYou always talk about how you ran this place by yourself so why can\u2019t you do it now, I\u2019m sending out the bills for this month.\u201d He replied \u201cFuck the bills, come out here and change some tires.\u201d This is where I got pissed off \u201cFirst of all\u201d I said \u201c you are not my boss, I\u2019m the one running this place and I sign your paychecks so if anyone is going to tell someone what to do, it\u2019s going to be me telling you.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not taking orders from a damn kid\u201d he said. \u201c Look, I know it\u2019s hard to take orders from someone that\u2019s young and that is new here but you know what\u2019s harder?\u201dthere was a pause and he said \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d \u201cFeeding your family and paying the bills without a fucking  paycheck.\u201d He just looked at me then when back outside and hasn\u2019t said anything to be since. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at an employee for them disrespecting their boss?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling an employee that it's hard to pay the bills without a paycheck. The situation involves a 19-year-old who's managing a gas station, working alongside a more experienced employee. The employee has been rude and dismissive, and the author finally snaps.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The employee has been working there for 7 years and took over when another worker left. He's been cussing at the author and belittling him for not doing the mechanic work. The author, as the manager, is handling office tasks and sending out bills. The employee's behavior is clearly disrespectful and unprofessional. \n\nThe author responds by asserting his authority, pointing out that he signs the employee's paycheck and that the employee's behavior is unprofessional. The final retort about the difficulty of paying bills without a paycheck is a bit harsh but could be seen as a defense of his role. \n\nNow, the key points here are: \n1. The employee's disrespect and refusal to follow instructions.\n2. The author's role as the manager and owner's heir apparent.\n3. The author's response in the heat of the moment.\n\nThe author's main mistake might be the use of harsh language (\"fucking paycheck\") which could escalate tensions. However, the employee's behavior was ongoing and unprofessional. The author had a right to assert authority, but the way he did it could be seen as inappropriate. \n\nOn the other hand, the employee's behavior is unprofessional and deserves correction. The author is new but in a position of authority. The response might be justified as a way to establish respect. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a toss-up. The employee was disrespectful, but the author's response was harsh. However, considering the context of ongoing disrespect, the author's reaction might be seen as a necessary assertion of authority, albeit with poor language. Therefore, the answer might lean towards B (No), but some might argue A (Yes) due to the language used. But given the employee's prior behavior, the author's response is more about self-defense in maintaining authority. So, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
