My grandfather owns a full service gas station where we do tires and mechanic work. When I graduate my grandfather offered me the job of managing the place and I said yes. I\u2019m good with working with my hands and enjoy working on cars but my grandfather wanted me to run the office and do all of the paperwork. When it got super busy I would go out and help with changing tires and oil. One of the workers just quit a few months before I got hired, so there was just one man (he is in his late 40s) beside me. This guy has worked here for 7 years and did all of the mechanic work while my grandfather did the office. The employee brags all the time about how he pretty much ran this place when the other worker quit. While I\u2019m taking care of sending out bills and doing other paperwork the guy comes in and start cussing at me telling me to \u201cget off my ass and do some real work for once\u201d. This happens pretty much every day. After 3 months of it I got pissed off. 3 days ago he came in and said \u201cI\u2019ve got 2 cars out here that need tires on them, why don\u2019t you get off your lazy ass and do some manly work.\u201d I responded with \u201cYou always talk about how you ran this place by yourself so why can\u2019t you do it now, I\u2019m sending out the bills for this month.\u201d He replied \u201cFuck the bills, come out here and change some tires.\u201d This is where I got pissed off \u201cFirst of all\u201d I said \u201c you are not my boss, I\u2019m the one running this place and I sign your paychecks so if anyone is going to tell someone what to do, it\u2019s going to be me telling you.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not taking orders from a damn kid\u201d he said. \u201c Look, I know it\u2019s hard to take orders from someone that\u2019s young and that is new here but you know what\u2019s harder?\u201dthere was a pause and he said \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d \u201cFeeding your family and paying the bills without a fucking  paycheck.\u201d He just looked at me then when back outside and hasn\u2019t said anything to be since. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at an employee for them disrespecting their boss?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, who's 19, is managing a gas station. They handle the office work while the older employee does the mechanic stuff. The employee has been rude, telling the author to get off their ass and do real work. The author finally snaps and tells him that it's hard to pay the bills without a paycheck, implying that the employee's job is at risk if he doesn't take his responsibilities seriously.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is the boss, even though they're young. The employee has been disrespectful and not pulling his weight, maybe. The author is trying to assert authority, which is a reasonable thing for a boss to do. The employee was already acting like he was in charge, so the author pushing back makes sense. The employee's response was to dismiss the author's role as a manager, which is a problem because the author is the one running the place now. \n\nThe key here is that the author was defending their position as the boss. When the employee said \"Fuck the bills, come out here and change some tires,\" the author was pointing out that the employee's paycheck depends on the author. That's a valid point in a workplace setting. The author's response was direct and maybe a bit harsh, but it's a common management tactic to remind employees of their job security when they're not respecting authority or the work.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they were standing up for themselves as the manager. The employee's behavior was unprofessional, so the author's reaction, while maybe strong, is a justified response to protect their position. The employee was being disrespectful and not following the new hierarchy. The author's comment about paying bills without a check is a way to emphasize their authority. So, probably the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
