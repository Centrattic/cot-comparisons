My grandfather owns a full service gas station where we do tires and mechanic work. When I graduate my grandfather offered me the job of managing the place and I said yes. I\u2019m good with working with my hands and enjoy working on cars but my grandfather wanted me to run the office and do all of the paperwork. When it got super busy I would go out and help with changing tires and oil. One of the workers just quit a few months before I got hired, so there was just one man (he is in his late 40s) beside me. This guy has worked here for 7 years and did all of the mechanic work while my grandfather did the office. The employee brags all the time about how he pretty much ran this place when the other worker quit. While I\u2019m taking care of sending out bills and doing other paperwork the guy comes in and start cussing at me telling me to \u201cget off my ass and do some real work for once\u201d. This happens pretty much every day. After 3 months of it I got pissed off. 3 days ago he came in and said \u201cI\u2019ve got 2 cars out here that need tires on them, why don\u2019t you get off your lazy ass and do some manly work.\u201d I responded with \u201cYou always talk about how you ran this place by yourself so why can\u2019t you do it now, I\u2019m sending out the bills for this month.\u201d He replied \u201cFuck the bills, come out here and change some tires.\u201d This is where I got pissed off \u201cFirst of all\u201d I said \u201c you are not my boss, I\u2019m the one running this place and I sign your paychecks so if anyone is going to tell someone what to do, it\u2019s going to be me telling you.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not taking orders from a damn kid\u201d he said. \u201c Look, I know it\u2019s hard to take orders from someone that\u2019s young and that is new here but you know what\u2019s harder?\u201dthere was a pause and he said \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d \u201cFeeding your family and paying the bills without a fucking  paycheck.\u201d He just looked at me then when back outside and hasn\u2019t said anything to be since. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at an employee for them disrespecting their boss?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling an employee that it's hard to pay bills without a paycheck. The situation is that the author, who's 19 and managing their grandfather's gas station, is dealing with an older employee who's been working there for 7 years. The employee has been disrespectful and telling the author to get off their ass and do real work. The author responds by pointing out that the employee's paycheck comes from them and that not getting paid is harder than taking orders.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is the new manager but is still young and might be in a position of authority they're not fully respected for. The employee has been there longer and maybe feels entitled to more respect or work. The key here is the employee's behavior: cussing, disrespecting the author as a boss, and not doing their job. The author's response is to stand up for their authority, which is necessary in a managerial role.\n\nThe author's retort about paying bills without a paycheck could be seen as a bit harsh or passive-aggressive. However, the employee's actions were clearly disrespectful. The author is trying to assert their position as the boss. The employee's pay is dependent on the author, so the author has a valid point in emphasizing that. The confrontation seems to be the author defending their role after repeated disrespect.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the employee was definitely in the wrong for being disrespectful. The author, as the manager, has the responsibility to maintain authority. The response might have been a bit confrontational, but the situation had built-up tension. The author's line about the paycheck is a way to highlight the power dynamic, which is a valid managerial tactic. However, maybe the language was a bit too harsh, using \"fucking\" might not be appropriate in a professional setting, but the context was a heated argument.\n\nConsidering all that, the author is probably not in the wrong. They were asserting their authority after being disrespected. The employee's behavior was the main issue here. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
