My grandfather owns a full service gas station where we do tires and mechanic work. When I graduate my grandfather offered me the job of managing the place and I said yes. I\u2019m good with working with my hands and enjoy working on cars but my grandfather wanted me to run the office and do all of the paperwork. When it got super busy I would go out and help with changing tires and oil. One of the workers just quit a few months before I got hired, so there was just one man (he is in his late 40s) beside me. This guy has worked here for 7 years and did all of the mechanic work while my grandfather did the office. The employee brags all the time about how he pretty much ran this place when the other worker quit. While I\u2019m taking care of sending out bills and doing other paperwork the guy comes in and start cussing at me telling me to \u201cget off my ass and do some real work for once\u201d. This happens pretty much every day. After 3 months of it I got pissed off. 3 days ago he came in and said \u201cI\u2019ve got 2 cars out here that need tires on them, why don\u2019t you get off your lazy ass and do some manly work.\u201d I responded with \u201cYou always talk about how you ran this place by yourself so why can\u2019t you do it now, I\u2019m sending out the bills for this month.\u201d He replied \u201cFuck the bills, come out here and change some tires.\u201d This is where I got pissed off \u201cFirst of all\u201d I said \u201c you are not my boss, I\u2019m the one running this place and I sign your paychecks so if anyone is going to tell someone what to do, it\u2019s going to be me telling you.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not taking orders from a damn kid\u201d he said. \u201c Look, I know it\u2019s hard to take orders from someone that\u2019s young and that is new here but you know what\u2019s harder?\u201dthere was a pause and he said \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d \u201cFeeding your family and paying the bills without a fucking  paycheck.\u201d He just looked at me then when back outside and hasn\u2019t said anything to be since. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at an employee for them disrespecting their boss?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the 19-year-old who was put in charge) is in the wrong for telling an employee that it's hard to pay the bills without a paycheck. The context is that the employee, who's older and more experienced in the shop, has been disrespecting the author, belittling their role in the office, and not following their orders. The author finally snaps and tells him that without his paycheck (which the author is responsible for), it's harder to pay bills.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the power dynamics here. The author is the new manager, even though they're young. The employee has been there for 7 years and was doing the manual work. The grandfather previously handled the office work, but now the author is taking over that role. The employee is acting like he's in charge, which the author is trying to correct.\n\nThe employee's behavior includes daily cussing, disrespect, and not following the author's orders. The author's response is to confront him by pointing out that the employee's paycheck is in the author's hands. The key here is whether the author's response was appropriate. The author is trying to assert authority, which is a valid part of being a manager. The employee's attitude has been problematic, so the author's frustration is understandable.\n\nThe author's statement is a form of asserting that their role (handling bills and office work) is crucial, and that the employee's paycheck depends on their work. It's a bit of a threat, but in the context of a workplace where the employee is not respecting the new manager, it might be seen as necessary to establish boundaries. The employee then stops talking to the author, which could indicate that the message got through.\n\nHowever, there's a question about the tone. The author uses explicit language (\"f*cking check\"), which might be seen as unprofessional. But given the employee's previous disrespectful behavior, the author might be mirroring that to emphasize the seriousness of the situation. The main point is about respect and authority. The author isn't in the wrong for standing up for their role, especially when the employee was not following orders and was being rude.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They were defending their position and the importance of their role, which is necessary in a management context. The employee's behavior warranted a firm response, and the author's words were a way to reinforce their authority and the reality that the employee's job depends on them. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
