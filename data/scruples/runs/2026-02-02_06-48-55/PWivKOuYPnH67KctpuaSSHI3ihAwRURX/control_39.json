My grandfather owns a full service gas station where we do tires and mechanic work. When I graduate my grandfather offered me the job of managing the place and I said yes. I\u2019m good with working with my hands and enjoy working on cars but my grandfather wanted me to run the office and do all of the paperwork. When it got super busy I would go out and help with changing tires and oil. One of the workers just quit a few months before I got hired, so there was just one man (he is in his late 40s) beside me. This guy has worked here for 7 years and did all of the mechanic work while my grandfather did the office. The employee brags all the time about how he pretty much ran this place when the other worker quit. While I\u2019m taking care of sending out bills and doing other paperwork the guy comes in and start cussing at me telling me to \u201cget off my ass and do some real work for once\u201d. This happens pretty much every day. After 3 months of it I got pissed off. 3 days ago he came in and said \u201cI\u2019ve got 2 cars out here that need tires on them, why don\u2019t you get off your lazy ass and do some manly work.\u201d I responded with \u201cYou always talk about how you ran this place by yourself so why can\u2019t you do it now, I\u2019m sending out the bills for this month.\u201d He replied \u201cFuck the bills, come out here and change some tires.\u201d This is where I got pissed off \u201cFirst of all\u201d I said \u201c you are not my boss, I\u2019m the one running this place and I sign your paychecks so if anyone is going to tell someone what to do, it\u2019s going to be me telling you.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not taking orders from a damn kid\u201d he said. \u201c Look, I know it\u2019s hard to take orders from someone that\u2019s young and that is new here but you know what\u2019s harder?\u201dthere was a pause and he said \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d \u201cFeeding your family and paying the bills without a fucking  paycheck.\u201d He just looked at me then when back outside and hasn\u2019t said anything to be since. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at an employee for them disrespecting their boss?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling an employee that it's hard to pay bills without a paycheck.\n\nSo the situation is that the author, who is 19 and managing the gas station after being offered the job by their grandfather, is dealing with an employee who's been there for 7 years. The employee keeps belittling the author, telling them to get off their ass and do real work. The author responds by pointing out that they're the one signing his paycheck and that it's hard to take orders from a kid, but then says the hard part is feeding the family without a paycheck when the employee is being disrespectful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the power dynamic here. The author is the boss, even though they're young. The employee has been there longer and seems to have a sense of entitlement, maybe from the previous situation where the grandfather handled the office and the employee did the work. Now that the author is in charge, the employee is challenging their authority.\n\nThe employee's behavior is clearly disrespectful. Telling the boss to get off their ass and do work is unprofessional. The author's response, while maybe a bit harsh in tone (\"feeding your family without a paycheck\"), is in the context of standing up for their authority. The key point is that the employee was being disrespectful and the author is asserting their position as the manager.\n\nThe question is whether the author went too far. The comment about the paycheck is a direct response to the employee's disrespect, emphasizing that the author has the power to stop the employee's income. That's a strong move, but in a situation where the employee is being defiant, maybe it's necessary to establish authority. However, the language is aggressive and could be seen as threatening. But given that the employee was already cussing and being abusive, the author's response might be justified as self-defense in terms of asserting leadership.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the grandfather offered the job, so they have legitimate authority. The employee's attitude might stem from a lack of respect for the younger boss, which is a common issue in workplaces. The author's response was to point out the consequences of the employee's actions (no paycheck) if he doesn't comply. That's a classic management tactic, though delivered in a confrontational way.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The employee was being disrespectful, and the author was defending their role. The answer should be B (No).\n"
