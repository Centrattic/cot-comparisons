My grandfather owns a full service gas station where we do tires and mechanic work. When I graduate my grandfather offered me the job of managing the place and I said yes. I\u2019m good with working with my hands and enjoy working on cars but my grandfather wanted me to run the office and do all of the paperwork. When it got super busy I would go out and help with changing tires and oil. One of the workers just quit a few months before I got hired, so there was just one man (he is in his late 40s) beside me. This guy has worked here for 7 years and did all of the mechanic work while my grandfather did the office. The employee brags all the time about how he pretty much ran this place when the other worker quit. While I\u2019m taking care of sending out bills and doing other paperwork the guy comes in and start cussing at me telling me to \u201cget off my ass and do some real work for once\u201d. This happens pretty much every day. After 3 months of it I got pissed off. 3 days ago he came in and said \u201cI\u2019ve got 2 cars out here that need tires on them, why don\u2019t you get off your lazy ass and do some manly work.\u201d I responded with \u201cYou always talk about how you ran this place by yourself so why can\u2019t you do it now, I\u2019m sending out the bills for this month.\u201d He replied \u201cFuck the bills, come out here and change some tires.\u201d This is where I got pissed off \u201cFirst of all\u201d I said \u201c you are not my boss, I\u2019m the one running this place and I sign your paychecks so if anyone is going to tell someone what to do, it\u2019s going to be me telling you.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not taking orders from a damn kid\u201d he said. \u201c Look, I know it\u2019s hard to take orders from someone that\u2019s young and that is new here but you know what\u2019s harder?\u201dthere was a pause and he said \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d \u201cFeeding your family and paying the bills without a fucking  paycheck.\u201d He just looked at me then when back outside and hasn\u2019t said anything to be since. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at an employee for them disrespecting their boss?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling an employee that it's hard to pay the bills without a check. The situation is that the author, who's 19, was given a management role by their grandfather at a gas station. The employee, who had been there 7 years, keeps berating the author for not doing \"real work\" and instead being in the office. The author finally snaps and tells the employee that without their paycheck, it's hard to pay the bills.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The author is the new manager, even though they're young. The employee has been there longer and was doing the mechanic work. The grandfather probably transitioned the office duties to the author while the employee continued with the hands-on work. The employee brags about running the place when someone else quit, but now the author is in charge. The employee's behavior seems disrespectful, maybe even undermining the author's authority.\n\nThe key points here are the employee's disrespect and the author's response. The employee told the author to \"get off my ass\" and dismissed the importance of the bills. The author then confronts them by pointing out the employee's paycheck depends on them. The user is asking if the author was wrong to get angry and make that statement.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about appropriate authority and communication. The author is the new manager, so establishing authority is important. The employee's daily insults would be unprofessional. The author's response, while confrontational, might be seen as asserting their role. However, the use of profanity could be a point against it. But considering the employee's behavior, the author had a reason to push back. \n\nFrom a management perspective, it's not appropriate for an employee to speak to a boss that way, regardless of age or experience. The author's frustration is understandable, especially if they're being belittled every day. The employee's pay is the author's responsibility, so pointing that out is a form of holding the employee accountable for their attitude. \n\nBut maybe the author should have handled it differently, like discussing it with the grandfather first or addressing the issue more formally. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for their response. The employee was clearly in the wrong for disrespecting their boss. The author's reaction was a response to that, and it seems like a justified stand to assert their position. \n\nSo the answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong. They were standing up for their authority and pointing out the employee's paycheck dependency. The employee's behavior was unprofessional, and the author's response, while using strong language, was a reaction to ongoing disrespect.\n"
