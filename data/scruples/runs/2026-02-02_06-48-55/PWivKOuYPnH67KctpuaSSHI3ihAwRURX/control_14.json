My grandfather owns a full service gas station where we do tires and mechanic work. When I graduate my grandfather offered me the job of managing the place and I said yes. I\u2019m good with working with my hands and enjoy working on cars but my grandfather wanted me to run the office and do all of the paperwork. When it got super busy I would go out and help with changing tires and oil. One of the workers just quit a few months before I got hired, so there was just one man (he is in his late 40s) beside me. This guy has worked here for 7 years and did all of the mechanic work while my grandfather did the office. The employee brags all the time about how he pretty much ran this place when the other worker quit. While I\u2019m taking care of sending out bills and doing other paperwork the guy comes in and start cussing at me telling me to \u201cget off my ass and do some real work for once\u201d. This happens pretty much every day. After 3 months of it I got pissed off. 3 days ago he came in and said \u201cI\u2019ve got 2 cars out here that need tires on them, why don\u2019t you get off your lazy ass and do some manly work.\u201d I responded with \u201cYou always talk about how you ran this place by yourself so why can\u2019t you do it now, I\u2019m sending out the bills for this month.\u201d He replied \u201cFuck the bills, come out here and change some tires.\u201d This is where I got pissed off \u201cFirst of all\u201d I said \u201c you are not my boss, I\u2019m the one running this place and I sign your paychecks so if anyone is going to tell someone what to do, it\u2019s going to be me telling you.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not taking orders from a damn kid\u201d he said. \u201c Look, I know it\u2019s hard to take orders from someone that\u2019s young and that is new here but you know what\u2019s harder?\u201dthere was a pause and he said \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d \u201cFeeding your family and paying the bills without a fucking  paycheck.\u201d He just looked at me then when back outside and hasn\u2019t said anything to be since. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at an employee for them disrespecting their boss?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling an employee that it's hard to pay the bills without a paycheck.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is 19, managing a gas station. The employee, who's been there 7 years, has been constantly berating the author for not doing enough work. The employee is older, in his 40s, and did all the mechanic work. The author handles the office and paperwork. The employee's attitude is disrespectful, calling the author lazy and questioning their authority. The author finally snaps and tells the employee that the employee's job is to work, and that the author is the one signing his paycheck. The employee then stops talking to him.\n\nNow, evaluating if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about workplace authority, respect, and appropriate communication. The employee's behavior seems unprofessional and abusive. He's not just giving constructive criticism but instead using insults and disrespect. The author, as the manager, has the right to enforce authority and set boundaries. The employee's actions likely contributed to the conflict by being disrespectful and not adhering to the hierarchy.\n\nThe author's response, while using a strong statement (\"paying the bills without a f*cking check\"), seems like a justified reaction to ongoing disrespect. It's a way to assert authority and make it clear that the employee's job is to follow instructions. The employee's reply indicates he understood the message and stopped his behavior, which suggests the author's approach was effective in that moment.\n\nIn terms of workplace dynamics, it's important that a manager can maintain control and respect. The employee's behavior was unprofessional and needed to be addressed. The author used a strong but not necessarily uncalled-for response given the context of repeated disrespect. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
