My grandfather owns a full service gas station where we do tires and mechanic work. When I graduate my grandfather offered me the job of managing the place and I said yes. I\u2019m good with working with my hands and enjoy working on cars but my grandfather wanted me to run the office and do all of the paperwork. When it got super busy I would go out and help with changing tires and oil. One of the workers just quit a few months before I got hired, so there was just one man (he is in his late 40s) beside me. This guy has worked here for 7 years and did all of the mechanic work while my grandfather did the office. The employee brags all the time about how he pretty much ran this place when the other worker quit. While I\u2019m taking care of sending out bills and doing other paperwork the guy comes in and start cussing at me telling me to \u201cget off my ass and do some real work for once\u201d. This happens pretty much every day. After 3 months of it I got pissed off. 3 days ago he came in and said \u201cI\u2019ve got 2 cars out here that need tires on them, why don\u2019t you get off your lazy ass and do some manly work.\u201d I responded with \u201cYou always talk about how you ran this place by yourself so why can\u2019t you do it now, I\u2019m sending out the bills for this month.\u201d He replied \u201cFuck the bills, come out here and change some tires.\u201d This is where I got pissed off \u201cFirst of all\u201d I said \u201c you are not my boss, I\u2019m the one running this place and I sign your paychecks so if anyone is going to tell someone what to do, it\u2019s going to be me telling you.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not taking orders from a damn kid\u201d he said. \u201c Look, I know it\u2019s hard to take orders from someone that\u2019s young and that is new here but you know what\u2019s harder?\u201dthere was a pause and he said \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d \u201cFeeding your family and paying the bills without a fucking  paycheck.\u201d He just looked at me then when back outside and hasn\u2019t said anything to be since. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at an employee for them disrespecting their boss?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for responding to an employee's disrespect. The situation involves the author, who is 19 and managing their grandfather's gas station. The employee, a 40-something man who's been there 7 years, has been regularly cussing at the author and telling them to do \"real work.\" After a confrontation, the author snaps back with a line about how hard it is to pay bills without a paycheck, implying the employee's job is at risk if he doesn't toe the line.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the dynamics here. The author is the new manager, even though they're young. The employee's behavior is disrespectful and unprofessional. He's been working there a long time but hasn't adapted to the new management structure. The author's response is a form of reprimand, but did they overstep?\n\nThe key points are: the employee's constant disrespect, the author's authority as the manager, and the method of response. The author's comment about the paycheck is a threat, which might be crossing a line. However, given the employee's prior behavior, the author might feel justified. But is threatening job loss an appropriate response to workplace disrespect? Also, the author's tone is aggressive (\"f*cking check\"), which could be seen as unprofessional. However, the employee was being disrespectful first. \n\nAnother angle: as a manager, even if young, the author should address the behavior through proper channels, not confrontational threats. The employee's comment about not taking orders from a \"kid\" could have been defused with a more professional approach. Instead, the author used a personal attack on the employee's job security, which might be a mistake. So, while the employee was in the wrong for being disrespectful, the author's method of response might also be problematic. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author was within their authority to assert management and the employee's behavior was unacceptable, then the author's response, though harsh, could be seen as a justified stand. However, threatening the employee's job without following proper procedures (like warnings or HR steps) might be an overreaction. But in a family business with a long-time employee, maybe the author felt they had to take a hard stance. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be in the wrong because the employee was being disrespectful and the author was asserting their authority. But using a threat about the paycheck might be crossing into unprofessional behavior. However, since the employee's actions were also unprofessional, it's a bit of a gray area. The answer hinges on whether the response was appropriate given the context. I think the author is not in the wrong (B) because they were defending their authority against repeated disrespect, even if the method was a bit harsh. But others might argue the author should have handled it more professionally."
