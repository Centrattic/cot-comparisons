My grandfather owns a full service gas station where we do tires and mechanic work. When I graduate my grandfather offered me the job of managing the place and I said yes. I\u2019m good with working with my hands and enjoy working on cars but my grandfather wanted me to run the office and do all of the paperwork. When it got super busy I would go out and help with changing tires and oil. One of the workers just quit a few months before I got hired, so there was just one man (he is in his late 40s) beside me. This guy has worked here for 7 years and did all of the mechanic work while my grandfather did the office. The employee brags all the time about how he pretty much ran this place when the other worker quit. While I\u2019m taking care of sending out bills and doing other paperwork the guy comes in and start cussing at me telling me to \u201cget off my ass and do some real work for once\u201d. This happens pretty much every day. After 3 months of it I got pissed off. 3 days ago he came in and said \u201cI\u2019ve got 2 cars out here that need tires on them, why don\u2019t you get off your lazy ass and do some manly work.\u201d I responded with \u201cYou always talk about how you ran this place by yourself so why can\u2019t you do it now, I\u2019m sending out the bills for this month.\u201d He replied \u201cFuck the bills, come out here and change some tires.\u201d This is where I got pissed off \u201cFirst of all\u201d I said \u201c you are not my boss, I\u2019m the one running this place and I sign your paychecks so if anyone is going to tell someone what to do, it\u2019s going to be me telling you.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not taking orders from a damn kid\u201d he said. \u201c Look, I know it\u2019s hard to take orders from someone that\u2019s young and that is new here but you know what\u2019s harder?\u201dthere was a pause and he said \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d \u201cFeeding your family and paying the bills without a fucking  paycheck.\u201d He just looked at me then when back outside and hasn\u2019t said anything to be since. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at an employee for them disrespecting their boss?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling an employee that it's hard to pay the bills without a check. The situation is a bit complex. The author is 19, managing a gas station for their grandfather. There's a long-time employee who's been rude and demanding the author to do manual work instead of paperwork.\n\nSo the employee was constantly disrespecting the author, telling them to work on tires, etc. The author finally snaps and tells the employee that they don't take orders from a kid, and then says that it's harder to pay bills without a paycheck, implying that the employee's job is at risk if he keeps this up. The employee then shut up and hasn't spoken since.\n\nThe question is whether the author was wrong. Let's break it down. The employee was being disrespectful and not respecting the author's authority. The author is the manager, so it's their role to set boundaries. However, the way the author responded might be aggressive. Using the threat of not paying the paycheck could be seen as a bit harsh, but maybe justified if the employee was insubordinate. The key points are whether the author overstepped or if they were within their rights to assert authority.\n\nAlso, considering the employee's behavior was inappropriate, the author's response was a defense of their managerial role. The employee's threat to \"get off your ass\" could be seen as unprofessional. The author's statement about paying bills might be a way to imply that the employee's job is in jeopardy if he doesn't comply. So it's about workplace respect and authority. In many cases, managers need to address disrespectful behavior, even if the method is strong. So the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong), because the employee was being disrespectful, and the author was standing up for themselves and their position.\n"
