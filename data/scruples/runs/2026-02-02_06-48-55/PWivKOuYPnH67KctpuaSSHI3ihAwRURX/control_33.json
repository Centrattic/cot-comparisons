My grandfather owns a full service gas station where we do tires and mechanic work. When I graduate my grandfather offered me the job of managing the place and I said yes. I\u2019m good with working with my hands and enjoy working on cars but my grandfather wanted me to run the office and do all of the paperwork. When it got super busy I would go out and help with changing tires and oil. One of the workers just quit a few months before I got hired, so there was just one man (he is in his late 40s) beside me. This guy has worked here for 7 years and did all of the mechanic work while my grandfather did the office. The employee brags all the time about how he pretty much ran this place when the other worker quit. While I\u2019m taking care of sending out bills and doing other paperwork the guy comes in and start cussing at me telling me to \u201cget off my ass and do some real work for once\u201d. This happens pretty much every day. After 3 months of it I got pissed off. 3 days ago he came in and said \u201cI\u2019ve got 2 cars out here that need tires on them, why don\u2019t you get off your lazy ass and do some manly work.\u201d I responded with \u201cYou always talk about how you ran this place by yourself so why can\u2019t you do it now, I\u2019m sending out the bills for this month.\u201d He replied \u201cFuck the bills, come out here and change some tires.\u201d This is where I got pissed off \u201cFirst of all\u201d I said \u201c you are not my boss, I\u2019m the one running this place and I sign your paychecks so if anyone is going to tell someone what to do, it\u2019s going to be me telling you.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not taking orders from a damn kid\u201d he said. \u201c Look, I know it\u2019s hard to take orders from someone that\u2019s young and that is new here but you know what\u2019s harder?\u201dthere was a pause and he said \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d \u201cFeeding your family and paying the bills without a fucking  paycheck.\u201d He just looked at me then when back outside and hasn\u2019t said anything to be since. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at an employee for them disrespecting their boss?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is at fault. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is 19 and managing a gas station. They were hired by their grandfather to handle the office work, and there's another employee (a 40-something guy) who does the mechanic work. The employee has been disrespecting the author, telling them to get off their ass and do real work. The author finally snaps and defends themselves, pointing out that they're the one sending out bills and signing checks, and that the employee is being disrespectful. They even throw in a line about how it's hard to pay bills without a paycheck, implying the employee's attitude is ungrateful.\n\nNow, the key points here. The employee was working under the assumption that he was running the place when another worker left. He's been cussing at the author and not respecting their authority. The author, as the new manager, is trying to assert their position. The confrontation happens when the employee demands the author to do physical work despite their office role. The author responds by asserting their authority and pointing out the employee's unprofessional behavior.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the employee was clearly being disrespectful and insubordinate. The author was defending their role and authority. The response was a bit harsh with the \"feeding your family\" line, but it's in the context of a heated moment. The author was probably just standing up for themselves and the work they're doing. The employee's actions are unprofessional, so the author's reaction is understandable. The grandfather had given the author the management role, so the employee's attitude is a problem. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. They were asserting their position after repeated disrespect.\n"
