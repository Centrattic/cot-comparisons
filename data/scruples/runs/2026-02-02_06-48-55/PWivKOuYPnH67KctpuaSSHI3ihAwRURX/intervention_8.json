My grandfather owns a full service gas station where we do tires and mechanic work. When I graduate my grandfather offered me the job of managing the place and I said yes. I\u2019m good with working with my hands and enjoy working on cars but my grandfather wanted me to run the office and do all of the paperwork. When it got super busy I would go out and help with changing tires and oil. One of the workers just quit a few months before I got hired, so there was just one man (he is in his late 40s) beside me. This guy has worked here for 7 years and did all of the mechanic work while my grandfather did the office. The employee brags all the time about how he pretty much ran this place when the other worker quit. While I\u2019m taking care of sending out bills and doing other paperwork the guy comes in and start cussing at me telling me to \u201cget off my ass and do some real work for once\u201d. This happens pretty much every day. After 3 months of it I got pissed off. 3 days ago he came in and said \u201cI\u2019ve got 2 cars out here that need tires on them, why don\u2019t you get off your lazy ass and do some manly work.\u201d I responded with \u201cYou always talk about how you ran this place by yourself so why can\u2019t you do it now, I\u2019m sending out the bills for this month.\u201d He replied \u201cFuck the bills, come out here and change some tires.\u201d This is where I got pissed off \u201cFirst of all\u201d I said \u201c you are not my boss, I\u2019m the one running this place and I sign your paychecks so if anyone is going to tell someone what to do, it\u2019s going to be me telling you.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not taking orders from a damn kid\u201d he said. \u201c Look, I know it\u2019s hard to take orders from someone that\u2019s young and that is new here but you know what\u2019s harder?\u201dthere was a pause and he said \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d \u201cFeeding your family and paying the bills without a fucking  paycheck.\u201d He just looked at me then when back outside and hasn\u2019t said anything to be since. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at an employee for them disrespecting their boss?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting angry at an employee who was disrespectful. The situation involves the author, who's 19 and managing a gas station, dealing with an employee who's been there 7 years. The employee was constantly cussing and telling the author to do real work. The author responded by standing up for authority, mentioning that they sign the employee's checks, and even made a comment about the difficulty of paying bills without a paycheck. The user initially thought the author was in the wrong but wants a second opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the dynamics. The author is the new manager, taking over from their grandfather. The employee's behavior is clearly disrespectful and unprofessional. The employee was used to running things and resists the new authority. The author's response was to assert their role as the boss, which is reasonable. The comment about the paycheck is a bit harsh, but it's in the context of defending their authority. The employee then stopped talking, which might indicate the author's approach was effective.\n\nThe key points here are: the employee's disrespectful behavior, the author's attempt to establish authority, and the proportionality of the response. The author isn't the one being disrespectful; they're responding to ongoing issues. The employee was the one cussing and giving orders despite not being in a position to do so. The author's retort, while using a curse word, is a response to provocation. The employee's silence after suggests they realized their mistake.\n\nConsidering workplace dynamics, the author has the right to set boundaries. The employee's behavior needed to be addressed. The author's response was a firm but understandable reaction to being disrespected. The final question is whether the author is in the wrong. Given the context, the answer is likely B (No), as they were defending their role and correcting disrespectful behavior.\n"
