My grandfather owns a full service gas station where we do tires and mechanic work. When I graduate my grandfather offered me the job of managing the place and I said yes. I\u2019m good with working with my hands and enjoy working on cars but my grandfather wanted me to run the office and do all of the paperwork. When it got super busy I would go out and help with changing tires and oil. One of the workers just quit a few months before I got hired, so there was just one man (he is in his late 40s) beside me. This guy has worked here for 7 years and did all of the mechanic work while my grandfather did the office. The employee brags all the time about how he pretty much ran this place when the other worker quit. While I\u2019m taking care of sending out bills and doing other paperwork the guy comes in and start cussing at me telling me to \u201cget off my ass and do some real work for once\u201d. This happens pretty much every day. After 3 months of it I got pissed off. 3 days ago he came in and said \u201cI\u2019ve got 2 cars out here that need tires on them, why don\u2019t you get off your lazy ass and do some manly work.\u201d I responded with \u201cYou always talk about how you ran this place by yourself so why can\u2019t you do it now, I\u2019m sending out the bills for this month.\u201d He replied \u201cFuck the bills, come out here and change some tires.\u201d This is where I got pissed off \u201cFirst of all\u201d I said \u201c you are not my boss, I\u2019m the one running this place and I sign your paychecks so if anyone is going to tell someone what to do, it\u2019s going to be me telling you.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not taking orders from a damn kid\u201d he said. \u201c Look, I know it\u2019s hard to take orders from someone that\u2019s young and that is new here but you know what\u2019s harder?\u201dthere was a pause and he said \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d \u201cFeeding your family and paying the bills without a fucking  paycheck.\u201d He just looked at me then when back outside and hasn\u2019t said anything to be since. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at an employee for them disrespecting their boss?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after telling an employee that it's hard to pay the bills without a paycheck. The situation involves a 19-year-old managing a gas station with an older employee who's been there seven years.\n\nFirst, the employee was disrespectful, cussing at the author every day. The author, as the manager, had to assert authority. The employee was even comparing his role to the author's, despite the author being the one in charge. The employee's attitude was clearly undermining the management structure.\n\nThe author responded by pointing out that he signs the employee's paycheck, which is a valid point. Then the author made a sarcastic comment about paying bills without a paycheck, which is a bit harsh but seems like a direct response to the employee's disrespect. The employee then went back to work without further confrontation.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's response was appropriate. The employee was being disrespectful, so the author had a right to defend their authority. The comment about the paycheck was a bit strong, but in the context of a heated exchange, it might be seen as justified. The employee's behavior needed to be addressed, and the author did so by asserting their position as the boss. The employee's reaction was to stop talking, which might indicate that the author's response was effective in setting boundaries.\n\nSo, considering the dynamics of the workplace and the need for a manager to maintain authority, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The employee's behavior was unprofessional, and the author responded by asserting their role. The harsh language might be a minor issue, but given the context, it's more about standing up to disrespect. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
