My grandfather owns a full service gas station where we do tires and mechanic work. When I graduate my grandfather offered me the job of managing the place and I said yes. I\u2019m good with working with my hands and enjoy working on cars but my grandfather wanted me to run the office and do all of the paperwork. When it got super busy I would go out and help with changing tires and oil. One of the workers just quit a few months before I got hired, so there was just one man (he is in his late 40s) beside me. This guy has worked here for 7 years and did all of the mechanic work while my grandfather did the office. The employee brags all the time about how he pretty much ran this place when the other worker quit. While I\u2019m taking care of sending out bills and doing other paperwork the guy comes in and start cussing at me telling me to \u201cget off my ass and do some real work for once\u201d. This happens pretty much every day. After 3 months of it I got pissed off. 3 days ago he came in and said \u201cI\u2019ve got 2 cars out here that need tires on them, why don\u2019t you get off your lazy ass and do some manly work.\u201d I responded with \u201cYou always talk about how you ran this place by yourself so why can\u2019t you do it now, I\u2019m sending out the bills for this month.\u201d He replied \u201cFuck the bills, come out here and change some tires.\u201d This is where I got pissed off \u201cFirst of all\u201d I said \u201c you are not my boss, I\u2019m the one running this place and I sign your paychecks so if anyone is going to tell someone what to do, it\u2019s going to be me telling you.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not taking orders from a damn kid\u201d he said. \u201c Look, I know it\u2019s hard to take orders from someone that\u2019s young and that is new here but you know what\u2019s harder?\u201dthere was a pause and he said \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d \u201cFeeding your family and paying the bills without a fucking  paycheck.\u201d He just looked at me then when back outside and hasn\u2019t said anything to be since. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at an employee for them disrespecting their boss?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for telling an employee that it's hard to pay the bills without a check. The situation is that the author is a 19-year-old managing a gas station, with an older employee who's been there seven years. The employee is brash, tells the author to work, and they get into a confrontation.\n\nSo first, the employee is being disrespectful and not following the hierarchy. The author is the new manager, but maybe the employee feels like he's done more work. The author responds by telling him that he's the one running the place now and that the employee's paychecks depend on him. The key line is where the author says it's hard to pay the bills without a check, implying that the employee needs him more than he needs the employee.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the employee was being disrespectful and not respecting the new management structure. The author is trying to assert authority. But the response might have been harsh. The author's words were a bit aggressive (\"feeding your family without a paycheck\") which could be seen as a threat or cutting off the employee's livelihood if he keeps being difficult. However, the employee was the one who started the conflict by disrespecting the author as a boss, even though the author is young.\n\nThe author had a right to defend their position, but maybe the way they did it was a bit strong. However, considering the employee's behavior of daily disrespect, the author might have been justified in pushing back. Also, the author is the one making the decisions now, so asserting authority is necessary. The employee's job is dependent on the author's grandfather, but the author is the one managing, so the author's words might be a way to remind the employee of his position.\n\nSo, I think the author is not in the wrong here. The employee was the one being disrespectful and not following orders. The author is trying to establish authority in a difficult role. The response, while maybe a bit harsh, was a way to set boundaries. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
