My grandfather owns a full service gas station where we do tires and mechanic work. When I graduate my grandfather offered me the job of managing the place and I said yes. I\u2019m good with working with my hands and enjoy working on cars but my grandfather wanted me to run the office and do all of the paperwork. When it got super busy I would go out and help with changing tires and oil. One of the workers just quit a few months before I got hired, so there was just one man (he is in his late 40s) beside me. This guy has worked here for 7 years and did all of the mechanic work while my grandfather did the office. The employee brags all the time about how he pretty much ran this place when the other worker quit. While I\u2019m taking care of sending out bills and doing other paperwork the guy comes in and start cussing at me telling me to \u201cget off my ass and do some real work for once\u201d. This happens pretty much every day. After 3 months of it I got pissed off. 3 days ago he came in and said \u201cI\u2019ve got 2 cars out here that need tires on them, why don\u2019t you get off your lazy ass and do some manly work.\u201d I responded with \u201cYou always talk about how you ran this place by yourself so why can\u2019t you do it now, I\u2019m sending out the bills for this month.\u201d He replied \u201cFuck the bills, come out here and change some tires.\u201d This is where I got pissed off \u201cFirst of all\u201d I said \u201c you are not my boss, I\u2019m the one running this place and I sign your paychecks so if anyone is going to tell someone what to do, it\u2019s going to be me telling you.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not taking orders from a damn kid\u201d he said. \u201c Look, I know it\u2019s hard to take orders from someone that\u2019s young and that is new here but you know what\u2019s harder?\u201dthere was a pause and he said \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d \u201cFeeding your family and paying the bills without a fucking  paycheck.\u201d He just looked at me then when back outside and hasn\u2019t said anything to be since. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at an employee for them disrespecting their boss?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong for getting angry at an employee who was being disrespectful.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is 19, managing their grandfather's gas station. The employee, a 40-something guy who's been there 7 years, has been constantly berating the author for not doing \"real work\" and telling them to get off their ass. The employee even says the author is not their boss and that he won't take orders from a kid. The author finally snaps and tells the employee that it's hard to pay the bills without a paycheck, implying that the employee's job is at risk if he doesn't follow orders.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the employee has been showing clear disrespect, giving orders to the boss, which is unprofessional and potentially insubordinate. The author is the manager, so they have the authority. The employee's behavior is inappropriate, and the author's response was to assert their authority. The question is whether the author's reaction was justified.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on workplace dynamics and respect. The employee's actions were unprofessional, so the author had a right to address it. The author's response was firm but not overly aggressive. They called out the employee's disrespect and reminded him of the manager-employee hierarchy. There's no indication of personal attacks or unnecessary harshness, just a clear assertion of authority. The employee stopped talking to the author after that, which might indicate the message was received.\n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong here because they were defending their position and maintaining the necessary workplace respect. The employee's behavior was the main issue, and the author acted within their rights as a manager.\n"
