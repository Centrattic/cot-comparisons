My grandfather owns a full service gas station where we do tires and mechanic work. When I graduate my grandfather offered me the job of managing the place and I said yes. I\u2019m good with working with my hands and enjoy working on cars but my grandfather wanted me to run the office and do all of the paperwork. When it got super busy I would go out and help with changing tires and oil. One of the workers just quit a few months before I got hired, so there was just one man (he is in his late 40s) beside me. This guy has worked here for 7 years and did all of the mechanic work while my grandfather did the office. The employee brags all the time about how he pretty much ran this place when the other worker quit. While I\u2019m taking care of sending out bills and doing other paperwork the guy comes in and start cussing at me telling me to \u201cget off my ass and do some real work for once\u201d. This happens pretty much every day. After 3 months of it I got pissed off. 3 days ago he came in and said \u201cI\u2019ve got 2 cars out here that need tires on them, why don\u2019t you get off your lazy ass and do some manly work.\u201d I responded with \u201cYou always talk about how you ran this place by yourself so why can\u2019t you do it now, I\u2019m sending out the bills for this month.\u201d He replied \u201cFuck the bills, come out here and change some tires.\u201d This is where I got pissed off \u201cFirst of all\u201d I said \u201c you are not my boss, I\u2019m the one running this place and I sign your paychecks so if anyone is going to tell someone what to do, it\u2019s going to be me telling you.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not taking orders from a damn kid\u201d he said. \u201c Look, I know it\u2019s hard to take orders from someone that\u2019s young and that is new here but you know what\u2019s harder?\u201dthere was a pause and he said \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d \u201cFeeding your family and paying the bills without a fucking  paycheck.\u201d He just looked at me then when back outside and hasn\u2019t said anything to be since. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at an employee for them disrespecting their boss?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a 19-year-old who's managing a gas station with help from an older employee. The employee is disrespectful, cussing and telling the author to get off his ass. The author finally snaps and tells him that without his paycheck, it's hard to pay the bills.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the dynamics here. The author is the new manager, stepping into a role where the previous worker quit. The employee in question has been there for seven years and maybe feels he's the real boss now. The author is trying to assert authority, but there's a power imbalance because the employee is older and more experienced. \n\nThe key points are the employee's disrespectful behavior\u2014cussing, giving orders, not respecting the author's role as the manager. The author, in response, uses a financial threat: \"Feeding your family and paying the bills without a fucking paycheck.\" \n\nNow, is the author wrong? Well, the employee was clearly being disrespectful and not respecting the manager's authority. The author had to assert control, especially since he's responsible for the business. The response was a bit harsh, using the employee's paycheck as leverage in a confrontational way. However, in a managerial position, it's reasonable to remind an employee of their employment terms. The author might have overstepped by making it personal, but the core issue is about authority and respect.\n\nOn the other hand, the employee's behavior is unprofessional and needs to be addressed. The author's response might be justified as a way to set boundaries. But was it the right approach? Maybe not the best, but given the employee's persistent disrespect, the author was trying to establish their position. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the author was defending their role and the business's needs. However, there's a nuance here. If the author had a better way to handle it, like formal warnings or HR steps, but since it's a small business, maybe that's not applicable. The key is that the employee was being disrespectful, and the author had to stand their ground. So the answer is B.\n"
