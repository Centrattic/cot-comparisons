My grandfather owns a full service gas station where we do tires and mechanic work. When I graduate my grandfather offered me the job of managing the place and I said yes. I\u2019m good with working with my hands and enjoy working on cars but my grandfather wanted me to run the office and do all of the paperwork. When it got super busy I would go out and help with changing tires and oil. One of the workers just quit a few months before I got hired, so there was just one man (he is in his late 40s) beside me. This guy has worked here for 7 years and did all of the mechanic work while my grandfather did the office. The employee brags all the time about how he pretty much ran this place when the other worker quit. While I\u2019m taking care of sending out bills and doing other paperwork the guy comes in and start cussing at me telling me to \u201cget off my ass and do some real work for once\u201d. This happens pretty much every day. After 3 months of it I got pissed off. 3 days ago he came in and said \u201cI\u2019ve got 2 cars out here that need tires on them, why don\u2019t you get off your lazy ass and do some manly work.\u201d I responded with \u201cYou always talk about how you ran this place by yourself so why can\u2019t you do it now, I\u2019m sending out the bills for this month.\u201d He replied \u201cFuck the bills, come out here and change some tires.\u201d This is where I got pissed off \u201cFirst of all\u201d I said \u201c you are not my boss, I\u2019m the one running this place and I sign your paychecks so if anyone is going to tell someone what to do, it\u2019s going to be me telling you.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not taking orders from a damn kid\u201d he said. \u201c Look, I know it\u2019s hard to take orders from someone that\u2019s young and that is new here but you know what\u2019s harder?\u201dthere was a pause and he said \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d \u201cFeeding your family and paying the bills without a fucking  paycheck.\u201d He just looked at me then when back outside and hasn\u2019t said anything to be since. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at an employee for them disrespecting their boss?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the 19-year-old manager) is in the wrong for responding angrily to an employee's disrespect.\n\nFirst, the situation: The employee has been cussing at the author, telling him to get off his ass and do real work. The employee brags about running the place, which he did when the other worker left. The author is handling office work and bills, while the employee does the mechanic work. After three months, the employee again pushes back, and the author snaps back about the employee not getting paid without the bills being handled. The employee then stops talking to the author.\n\nNow, the author's response: He confronts the employee, points out that he's the one running the place and signing the paychecks, and says that feeding the family without a paycheck is harder. The employee walks out and hasn't spoken since.\n\nKey points to consider:\n\n1. **Power Dynamics**: The author is the manager now, even though he's young. The employee is an older worker who has been there longer but is now a subordinate. The employee's behavior is disrespectful and possibly insubordinate. The manager has the authority to address this, especially since the employee is not following the new hierarchy.\n\n2. **Respect and Professionalism**: The employee's behavior of cussing and belittling the manager is unprofessional. The manager's response, while heated, is in defense of his authority and to assert that the employee's job (mechanic work) is necessary but the office work (which the manager is doing) is equally critical. The manager's point is valid because the bills need to be paid to keep the business running, which supports the employee's paycheck.\n\n3. **Proportionality of Response**: The manager's response was to stand up for himself and clarify the roles. While the language might be strong (\"f*cking check\"), the context is a heated argument. However, the manager's main point is about the necessity of his role. The employee then stops talking, which might indicate that the manager's message was received, but it could also lead to a hostile work environment if the employee feels disrespected.\n\n4. **Workplace Etiquette**: Employees should respect their managers regardless of age or experience. However, managers must also maintain a respectful tone. The manager's response might be seen as justified if the employee's behavior was chronic and unprofessional. However, using strong language could be seen as unprofessional as well, even if it's a response to provocation.\n\n5. **Outcome**: The employee stopped talking, which might mean there's a need for further resolution. But in terms of the initial conflict, the manager was defending his role and ensuring that the necessary office work wasn't neglected.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the manager's actions were a response to ongoing disrespect and insubordination. While the language used might be harsh, the core message about the importance of his role and the authority as a manager is valid. The employee was not fulfilling his part (by not doing all the work) and was disrespecting the manager. The manager's response was in line with asserting his position, so he's not in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
