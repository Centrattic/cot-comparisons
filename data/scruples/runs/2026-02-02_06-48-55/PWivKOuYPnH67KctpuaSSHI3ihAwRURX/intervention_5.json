My grandfather owns a full service gas station where we do tires and mechanic work. When I graduate my grandfather offered me the job of managing the place and I said yes. I\u2019m good with working with my hands and enjoy working on cars but my grandfather wanted me to run the office and do all of the paperwork. When it got super busy I would go out and help with changing tires and oil. One of the workers just quit a few months before I got hired, so there was just one man (he is in his late 40s) beside me. This guy has worked here for 7 years and did all of the mechanic work while my grandfather did the office. The employee brags all the time about how he pretty much ran this place when the other worker quit. While I\u2019m taking care of sending out bills and doing other paperwork the guy comes in and start cussing at me telling me to \u201cget off my ass and do some real work for once\u201d. This happens pretty much every day. After 3 months of it I got pissed off. 3 days ago he came in and said \u201cI\u2019ve got 2 cars out here that need tires on them, why don\u2019t you get off your lazy ass and do some manly work.\u201d I responded with \u201cYou always talk about how you ran this place by yourself so why can\u2019t you do it now, I\u2019m sending out the bills for this month.\u201d He replied \u201cFuck the bills, come out here and change some tires.\u201d This is where I got pissed off \u201cFirst of all\u201d I said \u201c you are not my boss, I\u2019m the one running this place and I sign your paychecks so if anyone is going to tell someone what to do, it\u2019s going to be me telling you.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not taking orders from a damn kid\u201d he said. \u201c Look, I know it\u2019s hard to take orders from someone that\u2019s young and that is new here but you know what\u2019s harder?\u201dthere was a pause and he said \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d \u201cFeeding your family and paying the bills without a fucking  paycheck.\u201d He just looked at me then when back outside and hasn\u2019t said anything to be since. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at an employee for them disrespecting their boss?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is 19, managing their grandfather's gas station. The grandfather offered them the job, and they're handling the office work. There's a senior employee, late 40s, who's been there 7 years, doing the mechanic work. He brags about running the place when another worker quit. The author helps out when it's busy, but the employee keeps cussing them out, telling them to get off their ass and do real work. The author finally snaps and tells him that the employee needs to focus on his job and that the author is the one running the place now. The author's response includes the line about it being hard to pay bills without a paycheck.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the power dynamics. The author is the boss, even though they're younger. Age doesn't determine who's in charge. The employee's behavior is disrespectful and unprofessional. Cussing at a superior, regardless of age, is a problem. The author is trying to maintain authority, which is reasonable. The employee's attitude of not respecting the boss is an issue. The author's response, while using strong language, is a reaction to ongoing disrespect. The key here is whether the author's actions were a justified response to the employee's behavior. The employee was undermining the author's authority, so the author stepping in to assert their role makes sense. The strong language might be a bit harsh, but it's in the context of standing up for oneself. The employee's problem is more about insubordination and disrespect. So, the author isn't in the wrong here because they're defending their position and addressing the employee's unprofessional conduct. The answer should be B (No).\n"
