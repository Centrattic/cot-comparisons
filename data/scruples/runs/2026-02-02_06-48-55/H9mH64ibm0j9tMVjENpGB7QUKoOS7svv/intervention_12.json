We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for lying to their wife about setting her alarm. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the situation: They both work nearby and drive together. The wife tends to hit the snooze button twice, which adds up to 14 minutes (7 each). The author wants them to leave at 7:35. The author wakes up at 6:30, sets the wife's alarm 13 minutes ahead so that when she wakes up, she thinks she has 35 minutes to get ready. Then, after she's in the shower, the author resets the alarm back. The wife has been under the impression that she takes 15 minutes, but actually, she's been getting 35 minutes the whole time. The author has been telling her that she's improved with being punctual, which she thinks is because of her own effort.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are deception, manipulation, and the intent behind the lie.\n\nOn one hand, the author's intention is to help the wife avoid being late and reduce arguments. The lie might have been a way to encourage her without confrontation. But on the other hand, intentionally manipulating someone's perception without their knowledge is a form of deception. The wife was not aware that she was getting more time than she thought, and the author was reinforcing the idea that she was improving when it was actually the lie that was helping her.\n\nThe author's actions could be seen as controlling because they're taking control of the wife's routine without her knowledge. Even if the outcome is positive (no arguments, punctuality), the method involves a lie that the wife isn't aware of. This might erode trust if found out, as the author wasn't honest about how they resolved the issue.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that people called it controlling and manipulative. That's a sign that there's a social perception issue here. Even if the author's intent was to help, the means involved deception which can be problematic in a relationship. Trust is important, and lying, even for a \"good\" reason, can be damaging.\n\nAnother angle: the wife might value her autonomy. If she had known she had more time, she could have adjusted her routine or habits. By not telling her, the author is making a decision for her, which might not respect her ability to manage her own time. It's a form of micromanagement disguised as a helpful lie.\n\nIn relationships, honesty is usually prioritized over convenience. The author could have approached the problem differently, like talking about the snooze button issue directly or finding another solution without deception. The fact that the author found a clever workaround but didn't communicate it honestly suggests that the lie was a way to avoid conflict rather than solving the root problem together.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, even though the outcome was positive, the method of deception and the lack of transparency make the author's actions ethically questionable. The lie, while well-intentioned, undermines trust and autonomy, which are important in a healthy relationship. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
