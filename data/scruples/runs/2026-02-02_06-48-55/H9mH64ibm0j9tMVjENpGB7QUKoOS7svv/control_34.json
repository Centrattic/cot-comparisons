We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for lying to his wife by adjusting her alarm. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple drives to work together, and the wife has a history of being late because she snoozes her alarm. The husband sets her alarm 13 minutes ahead so she thinks she has enough time to get ready, but he then resets it to the correct time after she's in the shower. The wife believes she's improved, but in reality, the husband is manipulating the time. \n\nNow, the key points here are deception and consent. The husband is intentionally lying by adjusting the alarm, which the wife is unaware of. The question is whether this is acceptable or not. \n\nArguments for the husband being wrong: Deception, even if well-intentioned, can erode trust in a relationship. The wife might feel manipulated if she finds out. Trust is foundational in relationships, and lying, even small ones, can be harmful. Also, the husband's actions prevent the wife from addressing her own habits honestly. She might not realize she needs to change her behavior because she thinks she's improved when she hasn't. \n\nArguments for it not being wrong: The husband's intention is to avoid arguments and ensure they leave on time. The lie is minor and doesn't cause harm, and it might be seen as a kind gesture to accommodate her. Some might argue that the ends justify the means here.\n\nBut considering relationship dynamics, honesty is crucial. Even if the husband's intention is good, the act of deception is problematic. The wife has the right to know the truth about her own schedule and her punctuality. The husband's solution is a workaround that doesn't address the root issue (the wife's tendency to snooze) and could lead to bigger issues if discovered. \n\nMost people would likely view this as manipulative because the husband is controlling the situation without the wife's knowledge or consent. The fact that others called it controlling or manipulative in the original post's comments supports that view. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because he's deceiving his wife to maintain his own schedule, which undermines trust and honesty in their relationship.\n"
