We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that he's been lying to his wife about setting her alarm clock ahead by 13 minutes to make her leave on time. He does this to avoid arguments about her being late. The key points here are deception and the wife's unawareness of the real time her alarm is set.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications of his actions. Lying to someone, especially a spouse, is generally frowned upon. Even if the intention is good\u2014like avoiding arguments\u2014it's still a form of manipulation. The wife thinks she's improved her time management, but in reality, she's being misled. That could erode trust if she ever finds out.\n\nThen there's the aspect of control. By adjusting the alarm without her knowledge, the husband is taking control over her routine. The comments from others in the subreddit called it controlling and manipulative, which are valid concerns. Even if it's done with good intentions, the act of secretly altering her schedule without consent is problematic.\n\nAnother angle is the potential harm. If the wife ever discovers the truth, she might feel betrayed. Trust is crucial in a relationship, and this kind of deception, even if well-meaning, can damage that trust. It's also possible that she might have wanted to address her punctuality issues in a different way if she had known the real problem was the alarm time.\n\nHowever, the husband's motivation is to reduce arguments and make their mornings smoother. That's a valid concern. But the method he's using is deceptive. There might be better solutions, like communicating openly about the problem, setting a consistent routine together, or using other strategies without lying.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the husband's actions, while possibly with good intentions, are based on deception and lack of transparency. That makes the answer A, yes, he's in the wrong.\n"
