We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband who's been lying to his wife by setting her alarm clock ahead by 13 minutes. The goal here is to figure out if his actions are morally wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the details. The man and his wife drive to work together. She's been late because she snoozes her alarm twice, which adds 14 minutes. He sets her alarm 13 minutes ahead so that when she wakes up, she thinks she has 35 minutes but actually has less. He then resets the alarm back to the correct time after she's in the shower. The wife believes she's improved her punctuality, so he lets her think that. The key points here are deception and manipulation.\n\nThe user mentioned that some people called him controlling or manipulative. The question is whether this is a \"little white lie\" as he claims or something more serious. \n\nIn ethical terms, lying is generally considered wrong, especially when it affects someone else's autonomy. The husband's actions prevent his wife from making informed decisions about her morning routine. By altering the alarm, he's taking control of her schedule without her knowledge. This could be seen as a lack of respect for her agency. Even if the intention is good (to help her be on time), the method involves deception, which can erode trust. \n\nMoreover, the wife's improvement is based on a falsehood. If she knew the truth, she might not have developed the belief that she's more efficient, and she might have addressed the root cause of her lateness, like resisting the snooze button or adjusting her routine. The husband's solution is a workaround that doesn't address her actual habits and instead hides the problem. \n\nThe fact that he's been doing this for 8 months suggests that the deception is ongoing. Relationships require honesty and trust, so even if the initial lie seemed harmless, the long-term effect could be damaging. The wife might feel betrayed if she finds out, which could lead to more significant issues in the relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that it's a harmless lie that helps the wife feel better about her punctuality. However, the potential harm in the form of loss of trust and autonomy might outweigh the benefits. The husband could have approached the problem differently, like discussing the issue openly and finding a solution together, rather than manipulating the situation behind her back.\n\nIn conclusion, while the intention might be to help, the method involves deception and denies the wife the chance to make her own decisions. This makes the author likely in the wrong.\n"
