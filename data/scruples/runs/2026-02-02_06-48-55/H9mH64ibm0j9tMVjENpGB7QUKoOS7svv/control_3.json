We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is lying to their wife about setting her alarm clock. The lie is that they adjust the alarm to make her think she has more time than she actually does. The goal is to prevent her from being late, which they've had arguments about. The user is asking if they're the asshole for doing this.\n\nHmm, so first, the key points here are deception and consent. The wife isn't aware that her alarm is being manipulated. She thinks she's improving, but it's actually the husband's intervention. Even though the intention is good\u2014to avoid conflicts and ensure they leave on time\u2014lying can erode trust. \n\nIn relationships, honesty is usually valued. Even if the lie is harmless in the short term, it's a secret that the wife doesn't know about. If she found out, she might feel betrayed or manipulated, especially since she's taking credit for her own improvements. The husband isn't being transparent about his actions. \n\nAlso, the fact that others called it controlling or manipulative suggests there's a social consensus against such behavior. Even if the intention is good, the method is deceitful. The husband isn't addressing the root issue, like maybe changing their routines or communicating better, but instead uses a trick. \n\nSo, while the outcome (no arguments) is positive, the means (lying) are problematic. The wife's autonomy is being affected without her knowledge. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they've chosen deception over honest communication.\n"
