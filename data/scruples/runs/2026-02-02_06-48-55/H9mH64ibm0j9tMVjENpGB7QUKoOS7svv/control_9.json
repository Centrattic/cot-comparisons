We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband is lying to his wife about setting her alarm clock. Every morning, he sets her alarm 13 minutes ahead so she has more time, then resets it after she's in the shower. He does this to avoid arguments about her being late. The wife thinks she's improved her morning routine, but he's manipulating the alarm.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are deception and intent. The husband's actions are a lie, but his intention is to prevent arguments and help her. But is lying in a relationship ever acceptable? The wife isn't aware of the manipulation, which could affect her self-perception. She might think she's doing better, but it's actually the alarm that's helping.\n\nLying in relationships often leads to trust issues. Even if the intention is good, the act of deception can be seen as controlling. People might argue that the husband should have communicated the problem and found a solution together instead of hiding his actions. Maybe they could have adjusted the schedule or found another way to handle the morning routine without lying.\n\nThe user mentioned that people called it controlling or manipulative. Those are strong terms, but they might be valid. The husband is making decisions for his wife without her knowledge, which undermines her autonomy. Even if it's for a positive outcome, the method is questionable. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband's actions are meant to reduce conflict and help his wife, which are positive intentions. But the means he used (deception) could be problematic. There's a balance between solving a problem and respecting a partner's agency. \n\nI think the answer here leans towards the husband being in the wrong because the deception, even if well-intentioned, is a breach of trust. Relationships require honesty, and manipulating a partner's routine without their knowledge isn't healthy in the long run. So, Answer A: Yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
