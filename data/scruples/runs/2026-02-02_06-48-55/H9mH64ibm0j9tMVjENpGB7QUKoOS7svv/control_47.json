We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're the asshole for lying to their wife about setting her alarm forward. They used to argue about her being late, so they started adjusting her alarm to give her more time without her knowing. The lie is that she thinks her shower, getting dressed, and makeup take 15 minutes, but actually, the adjusted alarm gives her more.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if this is a harmful lie. The intention was to reduce arguments and help her manage time better. The person didn't tell her the truth because she was resistant to changing her habits. But lying about the time is manipulating her perception. \n\nThe key points here are consent and deception. The wife wasn't aware her alarm was being altered, which means she didn't agree to this method. If she knew, would she be okay with it? If she found out, would it erode trust? Also, the fact that the person smiles and agrees with her improvement when she comments on it shows they're aware she's under the impression she's improving on her own. That's a form of manipulation.\n\nEven if the outcome is positive (fewer arguments, more punctuality), the act of deception is still problematic. Lying to someone, even for their benefit, can be seen as a betrayal of trust. Relationships are built on honesty, and this kind of control without transparency might lead to bigger issues later. \n\nSo, the answer is A. The author is in the wrong because they manipulated their wife without her knowledge, even if the intention was good. Lying, regardless of the reason, isn't justified here. They could have approached the problem differently, like discussing it openly and finding a compromise. The deception undermines the trust and respect that should be in a marriage.\n"
