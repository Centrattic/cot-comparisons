We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for lying to their wife about adjusting her alarm. The scenario is that the husband sets her alarm 13 minutes ahead so she thinks she has 35 minutes to get ready, when actually she has less. He does this so she doesn't get late, and he gets to make coffee. He's been doing this for months, and she's been improving, not knowing the truth.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The husband is manipulating the situation by altering the alarm without her knowledge. Even though the intention might be to help her avoid being late and make her feel better about her time management, the act itself is a lie. Honesty is a cornerstone of trust in relationships. If the wife discovers the truth, she might feel betrayed or manipulated, which could harm their relationship.\n\nThe argument for the husband being in the wrong would focus on the deception. He's not being transparent with his partner, which is a breach of trust. Even if it's a small lie, it's a lie nonetheless. The manipulation of time could be seen as controlling because he's taking away her autonomy in managing her morning routine. He's making decisions for her without her consent, which is a form of control.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the husband's intentions are good. He wants to help her avoid arguments and improve her punctuality. The lie is harmless and even beneficial, so the ends justify the means. However, the problem with this argument is that the method (deception) is unethical, regardless of the outcome. Trust is important, and even small lies can erode it over time.\n\nAnother point is that the husband is taking credit for her perceived improvement. By not correcting her when she comments on her progress, he's reinforcing a false belief. This could lead to overconfidence or complacency on her part if the actual time she has is less than she thinks. If she ever faces a situation where the alarm isn't adjusted, she might be unprepared.\n\nThe subreddit commenters called it controlling and manipulative, which are strong terms but not without merit. The husband is making decisions that affect her daily routine without her knowledge or consent. This lack of transparency is a key issue here. Even if the intention is good, the act itself is deceptive and undermines trust.\n\nIn relationships, honesty is usually valued more than convenience. The husband could have approached the problem differently, like discussing the issue openly and finding a solution together. For example, setting a realistic schedule that works for both of them without deception. That would maintain trust and involve mutual agreement.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the husband's actions, while possibly well-intentioned, are based on deception and manipulation. Therefore, he is in the wrong.\n"
