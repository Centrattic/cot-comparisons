We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this situation is the asshole (AITA) for lying to his wife about setting her alarm ahead. The main action here is that the author is adjusting his wife's alarm clock by 13 minutes to make her think she has enough time to get ready, but in reality, she's only getting the necessary time. He then resets the alarm back to the correct time after she takes a shower. The wife believes she's improved in time management, but the author is secretly manipulating the alarm.\n\nSo, the question is whether this is inconsiderate, controlling, or just a kind act. The user provided the original Reddit post where the author described the situation and received comments calling it controlling or manipulative.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key elements here. The author is intentionally deceiving his wife about the actual time, which affects her daily routine. Even though the intention might be to avoid arguments and help her be on time, the method involves lying and not being honest. Honesty is usually a fundamental aspect of trust in a relationship. The wife is unaware that her time management is being managed by her partner, which could be seen as a lack of respect for her autonomy. Even if the outcome is positive (no arguments, she's on time), the means are deceptive. \n\nThe other side is that the author's intention isn't malicious\u2014he's trying to make mornings easier and avoid conflict. The lie isn't harmful in the sense that it's not causing direct harm beyond the deception. However, the act of lying, even in a small way, can erode trust over time. If the wife found out, it could lead to feelings of betrayal. The author might also be avoiding addressing the root issue, like discussing time management strategies openly, rather than manipulating the situation behind her back.\n\nThere's also the aspect of consent. The wife isn't aware that her alarm is being adjusted, so she hasn't agreed to this arrangement. If they had discussed it and she was okay with it, maybe it's different, but since it's a secret, it's more about control without her knowledge. People might view this as a breach of trust, even if the intentions are good.\n\nIn terms of societal norms and Reddit's typical responses to such situations, many people do call out actions like this as controlling or manipulative, even if the intentions are good. The subreddit often sides with honesty in relationships. So, even if the author's motives are good, the act of deception is what's being criticized.\n\nTherefore, the author is likely in the wrong here because he's being dishonest with his wife, manipulating her schedule without her knowledge, which can be seen as a breach of trust and respect for her autonomy, even if the intention was to help avoid arguments and ensure punctuality.\n"
