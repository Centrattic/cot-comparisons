We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband is secretly adjusting his wife's alarm clock to make her think she's improving at waking up on time. He sets her alarm 13 minutes early, so she has more time, but he lies to her about it, making her believe she's managing her time better than she actually is. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The main issue is deception. The husband is lying to his wife by manipulating her alarm and not telling her the truth. Even though his intention might be good\u2014he wants to avoid arguments and help her be on time\u2014deception in a relationship can be problematic. Trust is a big part of any relationship, and lying, even if it's a \"white lie,\" can erode that trust.\n\nThen, there's the aspect of control. Some people might see this as manipulative because he's making decisions for her without her knowledge or consent. The wife is under the impression that her own time management is improving, when in reality, her husband is adjusting the alarm. This could be seen as controlling her behavior without her being aware. Others might argue that it's a kind gesture, trying to help her without conflict.\n\nLooking at the responses from the subreddit, many people called it controlling or manipulative. That suggests that the community's opinion is that the husband's actions, while possibly well-intentioned, cross a line. The husband's justification is that it's a small lie for a good cause, but the act of lying itself can lead to bigger issues if discovered later. It's also about respecting autonomy. The wife isn't making her own choices about her morning routine; she's being subtly controlled.\n\nAnother angle is the potential consequences if the lie were to be discovered. If the wife found out, she might feel betrayed or disrespected. The husband's actions, while trying to prevent arguments, could lead to more significant conflicts if the deception comes to light. It's important in relationships to communicate openly and honestly, even when it's difficult.\n\nHowever, there's also the context of their daily routine and the previous arguments about lateness. Maybe the husband was trying to find a solution that worked for both of them without causing daily stress. But the solution involved deception, which is a problem. A better approach might have been to discuss the issue with his wife, perhaps adjusting schedules together or finding a compromise that doesn't involve lying.\n\nIn summary, while the husband's intentions might be good, the act of lying and manipulating the situation without his wife's knowledge or consent is ethically questionable. It's a form of deception that can harm trust and respect in the relationship. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
