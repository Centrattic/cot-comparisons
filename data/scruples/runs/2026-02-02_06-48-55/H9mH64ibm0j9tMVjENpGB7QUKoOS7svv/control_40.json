We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is lying to their wife about setting her alarm clock forward. The wife thinks she's improving at not being late, but actually, her husband is manipulating the time. \n\nFirst, the intention: he wants to avoid arguments and get to work on time. But lying to her about the alarm might be a way to control her schedule without her knowing. The key issue here is deception. Even if the lie seems harmless, it's a betrayal of trust. \n\nThe wife's autonomy is affected because she doesn't know she's being set up to meet a false schedule. While the outcome is positive (she's on time, no arguments), the method involves deceit. Trust is a cornerstone in a relationship, and this kind of manipulation could lead to bigger issues if discovered. \n\nPeople might argue it's a harmless lie, but others see it as controlling. The line between a white lie and manipulation can be thin. Since the husband is altering a critical part of her routine without her knowledge, that's a breach of trust. So, even if well-intentioned, the act of lying repeatedly over months is problematic. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
