We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for lying to their wife about setting her alarm 13 minutes ahead. The situation is that the couple shares a morning routine, and the wife's snooze habit causes her to be late. The author manipulates the alarm time without her knowing, making her believe she's improved her morning routine.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author is intentionally deceiving their wife. Lying, even for what seems like a good reason, can erode trust in a relationship. Trust is fundamental, and if one partner is being manipulated, it's a form of dishonesty. The author's actions, while possibly well-intentioned (to avoid arguments and help the wife feel better), are still a deception. \n\nThe wife isn't aware of the manipulation, so she's acting under false premises. Even if the outcome is positive (she feels she's improved), the method is questionable. The key issue is the lack of transparency and consent. The author is making decisions for the wife without her knowledge, which could be seen as controlling. The fact that others called it controlling or manipulative in the subreddit comments supports that view.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that the lie is harmless and for the wife's benefit. However, the long-term effects of such deception could lead to bigger issues. If the wife ever discovers the truth, it might cause hurt feelings or a breakdown in trust. Relationships require honesty, even when it's difficult. The author should have addressed the problem in a more open way, maybe by discussing the morning issues directly and finding a solution together, rather than using a covert method.\n\nSo, considering the principles of honesty and consent in relationships, the author is likely in the wrong. The answer would be A.\n"
