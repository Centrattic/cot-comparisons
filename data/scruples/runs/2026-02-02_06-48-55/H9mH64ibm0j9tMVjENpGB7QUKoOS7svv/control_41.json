We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that he's been setting his wife's alarm 13 minutes ahead so she thinks she has enough time to get ready, but actually she's getting less. He does this to avoid her being late, and he claims it's a \"little white lie.\" People in the comments called him controlling or manipulative.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if his actions are wrong. Let's break it down. The key points are deception and the impact on the wife. By altering the alarm time, he's intentionally misleading her about her available time. While the intention might be good (avoiding arguments and her lateness), the method involves lying. \n\nEthically, lying, even if well-meaning, can be problematic. It violates trust because the wife isn't being given the truth. Even if she's benefited from the lie, she has the right to know the actual time she's working with. The fact that he's done this for 8 months without her knowing suggests a pattern of deceit. \n\nTrust is fundamental in a relationship. If she finds out, she might feel betrayed because he manipulated her daily routine without her consent. The justification of a \"white lie\" might not hold up here because it's a recurring action that affects her autonomy. \n\nAlso, the fact that he's been praised for her punctuality when she actually hasn't improved could be another layer. It's not just about time management but about presenting false information to maintain a facade. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe he's trying to help her by managing her time better. But even so, the right approach would be to communicate openly. Maybe setting a different alarm time together or discussing how to manage the morning routine without deception.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions are deceitful and undermine trust. Therefore, he is in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
