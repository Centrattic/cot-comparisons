We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for lying to his wife about setting her alarm ahead. So, I need to analyze the situation.\n\nFirst, the setup: The couple works close to each other and drives together. The wife has a history of being late because she snoozes. The husband sets her alarm 13 minutes ahead to give her enough time to get ready. He then resets it back once she's in the shower. The wife thinks she's improved in terms of punctuality, but in reality, the husband is manipulating the alarm. The husband is lying about her progress and not being honest about his actions.\n\nNow, considering the key points. The husband's intention is to avoid arguments and ensure they leave on time. But the method involves deception. The wife is unaware that her alarm is being manipulated, which means she's not making genuine improvements. The husband is also lying to her when she comments on her progress. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, honesty and trust are crucial. Even if the husband's motives are good, the act of lying and manipulating the situation without her knowledge is problematic. The wife might feel betrayed if she found out, which could lead to bigger issues in the relationship. The subreddit users called it controlling and manipulative, which makes sense because the husband is altering her environment without her consent. \n\nAdditionally, the husband is not addressing the root problem\u2014maybe discussing why she snoozes so much or finding a better way to manage their morning routine together. Instead, he takes unilateral action, which could undermine her autonomy. While the intention is to help, the method is ethically questionable. \n\nHowever, some might argue that it's a small white lie to maintain peace. But in relationships, even small lies can erode trust over time. The wife's ability to improve independently is being hindered because she's not aware of the manipulation. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the husband's actions, though well-meaning, are deceptive and could be seen as controlling. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
