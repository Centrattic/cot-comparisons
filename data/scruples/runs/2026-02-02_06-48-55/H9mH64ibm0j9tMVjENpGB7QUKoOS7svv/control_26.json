We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see here. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for lying to their wife by adjusting her alarm clock. The situation is that they both drive to work together, and the wife used to be late because she hit the snooze button twice. The husband started setting her alarm 13 minutes ahead. That way, when she hits snooze twice (14 minutes total), she ends up waking up at 7:15, which gives her enough time. He then resets her alarm to the correct time before she showers.\n\nSo, the key points here: The husband is lying about her alarm time to make sure she gets ready on time. He's doing this to avoid arguments and to help her be less late. But people are calling it controlling or manipulative. \n\nFirst, I need to consider whether this is a harmless lie or something more problematic. The husband's intention is to help her and the relationship by preventing conflicts. However, the method involves deception. The wife doesn't know the alarm is set forward, which affects her perception of her time. She thinks she's improved, when in reality, the husband has been manipulating the system.\n\nOn one hand, the husband is trying to solve a recurring problem. But on the other hand, he's not being honest. Lying, even with good intentions, can erode trust. The wife might feel disrespected if she found out she was being tricked. Also, the fact that he resets the alarm every day suggests it's a repeated action, not a one-time thing. \n\nAnother angle is consent. The wife isn't aware of the manipulation, so she hasn't agreed to it. In relationships, honesty is important. If there was a problem with her being late, a better approach might have been to communicate openly and find a solution together, like adjusting the schedule or finding another way to ensure she's ready on time without deception.\n\nThe arguments they had before were about her being late, which seems to be a real issue. But instead of addressing it directly, the husband chose to hide the real problem with a lie. This could lead to bigger issues if discovered. Trust is a cornerstone in relationships, and even small lies can have a negative impact if they're about something important like daily routines that affect both partners.\n\nSo, the husband's action is a form of manipulation because he's altering her reality without her knowledge. While the intent is to help, the means are deceptive. Therefore, the answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong. The correct choice is A.\n"
