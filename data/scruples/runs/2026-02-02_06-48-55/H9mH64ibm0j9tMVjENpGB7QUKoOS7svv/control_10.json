We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a man who's been lying to his wife about setting her alarm clock to make it seem like she's improving at waking up on time.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The couple drives to work together. The wife tends to hit snooze twice, which adds 14 minutes (since each snooze is 7 minutes), so she ends up with 35 minutes to get ready. The man sets her alarm 13 minutes ahead each day. That way, when she wakes up, she thinks she has just enough time. But he actually adjusts the alarm back after she uses it. She believes she's gotten better at managing her time, but he's secretly manipulating the alarm to make that happen. He's been doing this for 8 months and is lying to her about her improvements.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The original post got responses calling it controlling and manipulative. The user is asking if that's accurate.\n\nSo, what's the ethical angle here? Honesty in a relationship is important. Lying, even if with good intentions, can erode trust. The man's actions are intended to avoid arguments and help his wife feel better, but he's not being truthful. Even if the lie is \"white,\" it's still a lie. The wife isn't given the opportunity to address her own time management issues because the problem is being solved without her knowledge. This could lead to dependency or a lack of self-awareness on her part. Also, manipulating the alarm is a form of control without her consent. While the intention might be positive (avoiding arguments, ensuring they leave on time), the method is deceptive. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that it's a harmless solution to a recurring problem. However, in a healthy relationship, transparency is key. The man could have discussed the issue with his wife instead of taking matters into his own hands. By not being honest, he's potentially creating a bigger issue if the wife finds out later. The act of manipulating the alarm without her knowledge is a breach of trust, which is a significant factor in relationships.\n\nTherefore, even if the intention seems benign, the act of lying and manipulating the situation without the partner's knowledge is ethically questionable. It's more about the method rather than the intention. So the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
