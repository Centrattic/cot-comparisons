We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for lying to his wife about adjusting her alarm. The situation involves them both driving to work together, and he's been secretly setting her alarm 13 minutes ahead so she thinks she's improving in being on time. He does this to avoid arguments and mentions it's a \"little white lie.\"\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points here. The husband is altering his wife's alarm without her knowledge. The intention is to prevent her from being late, which has previously caused arguments. He sets her alarm ahead, so when she uses her usual time (accounting for snoozes), he makes it seem like she's improved. He then lies to her about her improvement, which she believes.\n\nSo, the main ethical issues here are deception and manipulation. The husband isn't being honest with his wife. Even if the intention is good (avoiding arguments and ensuring punctuality), the method involves ongoing deceit. The wife is being kept in the dark about a regular part of their routine. This could erode trust if discovered, which it eventually was, leading to the post.\n\nThe comments from others called it controlling and manipulative, which are valid concerns. Control in a relationship often involves one partner making decisions without the other's consent, especially when it affects their autonomy. Even if the husband's goal is to help, the lack of transparency and consent is problematic.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on the relationship. While the husband might think he's helping, the wife's ability to manage her own time is being undermined. She isn't actually improving her time management skills; she's just being misled. If this were to continue, it could lead to dependency or resentment once the truth comes out.\n\nAdditionally, the \"white lie\" defense might not hold up here because the lie is ongoing and affects the wife's daily routine. Small lies can escalate or cause more harm than good, especially when they involve someone's autonomy. The husband's actions, while perhaps well-intentioned, cross into ethical territory by not being honest with his partner.\n\nSo, considering all these factors\u2014deception without consent, manipulation, impact on trust and autonomy\u2014it seems the husband is indeed in the wrong. The answer should be A for Yes.\n"
