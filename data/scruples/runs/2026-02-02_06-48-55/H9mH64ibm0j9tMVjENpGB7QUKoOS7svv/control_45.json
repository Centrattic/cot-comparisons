We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand the situation.\n\nThe person is lying to their wife by setting her alarm 13 minutes ahead each morning. The wife thinks she gets 35 minutes to get ready, but actually has a bit more because the alarm is set forward. The author does this because the wife hits snooze twice (each 7 minutes), which makes her late. By setting the alarm ahead, the author gives her enough time to get ready, and then they adjust the alarm back to the correct time. The wife has improved in terms of being on time, and the author is praised for the \"white lie.\" However, others have criticized the author as controlling or manipulative. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, deception is involved here. The author is intentionally misleading the wife about the time to get her to be punctual. The wife is unaware of this manipulation. Even though the author's intention seems good\u2014avoiding arguments and helping the wife be on time\u2014the method involves lying. \n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. Lying, even if well-intentioned, can erode trust. The wife isn't being honest about her own time management; instead, her partner is adjusting the situation behind her back. This could be seen as a lack of communication. If the author had discussed the issue with the wife and found a solution together, that would be more respectful. But by manipulating the alarm, the author isn't addressing the root problem and is using a workaround that the wife isn't aware of.\n\nSome might argue that it's a harmless lie and that the outcome is positive. However, others might see it as controlling, as the author is taking control of the wife's routine without her knowledge. The wife's autonomy is compromised here. She isn't making the choice to adjust her behavior based on the truth; she's being tricked into it. If the author had approached the wife and explained the issue, maybe they could have agreed on a solution, like changing the alarm time or adjusting their morning routine together.\n\nAnother angle is the potential consequences. If the wife discovers the truth, it could lead to feelings of betrayal. Even if the author's intentions were good, the act of lying could cause more harm than the initial problem of being late. The author's solution is a temporary fix and doesn't teach the wife to manage her time effectively independently. The wife might not develop the necessary time management skills because she's relying on the manipulated alarm.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's actions might have reduced daily arguments and stress in their morning routine. The wife believes she's improving, which boosts her confidence. But this is built on a foundation of deception. The question then becomes whether the benefits of the lie outweigh the ethical concerns of deception and manipulation.\n\nIn many ethical frameworks, honesty is a key principle. Deception is generally considered wrong unless there's a significant benefit that justifies it. In this case, the benefit is avoiding daily arguments and ensuring punctuality. However, the harm is the erosion of trust through dishonesty. The balance here is tricky. If the wife is genuinely unaware of her time management issues, maybe the author's solution is a way to help her without conflict. But in the long term, honesty is usually preferable.\n\nTherefore, considering the ethical implications, the act of lying to manipulate a partner's behavior, even for a good reason, is likely the wrong approach. The right course of action would have been to communicate openly and find a mutually agreeable solution. Hence, the author is in the wrong.\n"
