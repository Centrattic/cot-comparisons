We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe user is asking if they're the asshole for lying to their wife by adjusting her alarm clock. They explain that they and their wife drive to work together. She used to be late because she hits the snooze button twice, which gives her 7 minutes each time, totaling 14 minutes. But she has 35 minutes to get ready, which isn't enough. So the user sets her alarm ahead by 13 minutes each day. While she's in the shower, they reset it back. The wife thinks her morning routine takes 15 minutes, and the user tells her she's improving, which isn't true. People in the previous subreddit called this controlling or manipulative. The user now asks if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points here. The main issue is deception. The user is intentionally altering the time on the alarm clock to make it seem like their wife is more efficient than she actually is. They do this to avoid arguments about her being late. The wife isn't aware of this manipulation and believes she's improved, while the user is lying about it. \n\nNow, considering the ethics of this. Deception in a relationship can be a big deal. Even if the intention is good\u2014like reducing arguments or helping the wife feel better\u2014it's still a lie. The wife is not in on this, so her autonomy is being compromised. She's making decisions based on false information. The user is not being honest with her, which can erode trust if discovered.\n\nAnother angle is the underlying issue: the wife's punctuality. The user is solving the problem by manipulating the alarm, but perhaps the better approach would be to communicate openly. If the wife is struggling with the morning routine, maybe they could adjust their schedule together, or find other solutions without deception. The user's method might be a short-term fix but could lead to bigger problems if the wife later finds out she was lied to.\n\nAlso, the user's actions could be seen as controlling because they're making decisions for their wife without her knowledge or consent. Even if it's for her benefit, it's not respecting her ability to manage her own time. The wife might have other reasons for hitting snooze or taking longer, and the user isn't addressing those; they're just covering it up.\n\nThe user mentions that sometimes a white lie is good, but the line between a harmless lie and an unethical one can be thin. However, in close relationships, honesty is usually valued. The fact that the user has been doing this for 8 months makes it a long-term deception, which is more significant than a one-time lie.\n\nPeople on the previous subreddit called it controlling and manipulative, which are serious accusations. The user might not see it that way, but others do, and that's a red flag. The wife's improved punctuality, which she attributes to her own effort, is actually due to someone else's manipulation. That could lead to a loss of self-efficacy for her if she ever finds out the truth.\n\nIn conclusion, while the intention might be to reduce conflict and help the wife feel better, the method involves deception and undermines trust and autonomy. The user is in the wrong because they're manipulating the situation without the wife's knowledge, which isn't respectful or honest in a healthy relationship.\n"
