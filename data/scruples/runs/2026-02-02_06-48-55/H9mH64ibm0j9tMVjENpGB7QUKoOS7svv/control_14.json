We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is lying to their wife about her alarm time. The setup is that they set her alarm 13 minutes ahead each morning so she has enough time to get ready, but she thinks she's improving. The key here is that the wife isn't aware of the deception.\n\nFirst, the act of lying. Even if the intention is good (to avoid arguments and help her be on time), deception is involved. The wife is being manipulated to believe she's improving, which might affect her self-perception. The husband's actions are altering her routine without her knowledge, which could be seen as controlling because he's making decisions without her consent.\n\nPeople in the comments called it controlling and manipulative. That's a red flag. Even if the outcome is positive (no arguments, on-time departure), the method is ethically questionable. Trust is a cornerstone in relationships, and lying, even for a \"good\" reason, can erode that trust. Also, the husband isn't addressing the root cause of their problem, which is the wife's tendency to hit snooze. Instead, he's fixing the symptom through deception, which isn't a sustainable solution.\n\nAnother angle: autonomy. The wife should have the right to manage her own schedule and time. By manipulating her alarm, the husband is taking away her agency. She might have preferred to address the snooze issue directly, maybe with open communication, rather than being tricked.\n\nHowever, the husband's intention was to help, not harm. But intentions don't absolve the action. The consequence is that she's unaware of her actual time management, which could lead to problems if discovered. Also, if this lie is exposed, it could cause bigger issues in their relationship.\n\nIn conclusion, while the husband's intentions may be good, the method of deception is problematic. The right course of action would have been to discuss the issue openly with his wife and find a solution together, rather than unilaterally deciding to lie. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
