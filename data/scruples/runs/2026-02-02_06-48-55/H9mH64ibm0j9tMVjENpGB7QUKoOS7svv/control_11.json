We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that the author lies to their wife by setting her alarm ahead by 13 minutes each day. The wife thinks she's been improving with punctuality, but the author is actually manipulating the time. The question is whether this is wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The couple shares a commute, and the wife is often late because she hits the snooze button. The author sets her alarm earlier to give her enough time, then resets it after the wife is up. The wife believes that her improved punctuality is her own doing, but it's actually due to the author's deception.\n\nNow, considering ethics and relationships. Honesty is a key component in relationships. Even if the intention is good (avoiding arguments, helping her get ready on time), the author is being deceptive. The wife isn't aware of the manipulation, which could erode trust if discovered. Some might argue it's a harmless lie, but others might see it as controlling because the author is making decisions for the wife without her knowledge or consent.\n\nThe Reddit responses mentioned that people called it controlling or manipulative. The author's action is keeping the wife unaware of the truth, which could be seen as a breach of trust. Even though the outcome is positive (no arguments, she's on time), the means involve deception. In ethical terms, lying is generally considered wrong unless there's a very strong justification, and even then, the consequences can be problematic.\n\nAnother angle: the wife's autonomy. By manipulating the alarm time, the author is not allowing the wife to make her own decisions about her morning routine. It might be that the wife could adjust her habits if she knew the true time, but the author is making choices for her, which could be seen as paternalistic.\n\nHowever, some might argue it's a minor lie with no harm done, just to maintain peace. But in relationships, transparency is important. Secrets, even small ones, can lead to bigger issues. If the wife found out, she might feel deceived, even if the intent was good.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the consensus is likely that the author is in the wrong. The deception, even if well-intentioned, violates trust and respects the wife's autonomy. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
