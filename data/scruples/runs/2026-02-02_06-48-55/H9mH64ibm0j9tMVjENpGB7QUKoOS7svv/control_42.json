We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's see. The situation is that the person is lying to their wife about setting her alarm clock. They wake up early, set her alarm 13 minutes ahead so she thinks she has more time, then reset it back when she's in the shower. The wife believes she's improved with being on time, but the husband is actually manipulating the alarm. The question is whether this is wrong.\n\nFirst, lying in a relationship can be a big deal. Even if the intention is good, like trying to avoid arguments or help her get ready on time, deception is involved. The wife is being kept in the dark about the real reason she's managing her time better. The husband is manipulating her schedule without her knowledge, which might be seen as controlling. People might argue that even if it's for her own good, she has the right to know the truth and make her own decisions. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband's actions have been ongoing for 8 months, and the wife hasn't noticed. He's also not causing harm, just helping her be on time. But the key issue is the deception. Lying, even a \"white lie,\" can erode trust over time. If the wife found out, she might feel betrayed, even if the intention was good. \n\nThe responses from others called it controlling or manipulative, which are strong terms. That suggests that the community sees this as a problem. So, even if the outcome is positive, the method is questionable. The husband is making decisions for his wife without her consent. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the act of deception without consent is generally considered wrong in relationships. Even with good intentions, the lack of transparency is the issue. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
