We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong. Let me read through the scenario again to make sure I understand it correctly.\n\nThe person admitted to lying to their wife by setting her alarm clock ahead by 13 minutes each day. The reason they gave is to avoid arguments about her being late. They wake up at 6:30, set her alarm earlier, so she has more time to get ready. When she's in the shower, they reset the alarm back. The wife believes she takes 15 minutes for her routine, but actually has more time. The person occasionally praises her for improving on punctuality, which is actually a result of the manipulated alarm. People online called this controlling or manipulative, and the person is asking if they're an asshole.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are deception and the intent behind it. The husband is lying to his wife about the time to make her think she's more efficient than she actually is. The underlying issue seems to be about managing their morning routine to avoid conflicts. But the method he uses is deception, which is the crux of the problem.\n\nNow, considering relationships, trust is a big component. If one partner is lying, even if it's for what they perceive as a good reason, that can be problematic. The husband's actions are manipulative because he's altering the environment (the alarm clock) without his wife's knowledge or consent. While the intention might be to reduce arguments, the method undermines trust and autonomy. The wife isn't making an informed decision about her time; she's being misled. Over time, this could lead to more significant issues if the deception continues. Even if the outcome is positive (less arguments, her feeling more punctual), the means are ethically questionable.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that it's a minor lie with good intentions, and maybe it's helping the relationship. However, in most ethical frameworks, deception is wrong unless it's to prevent harm. But here, the harm might be the arguments, but the deception itself could cause more harm in terms of trust. There's also the aspect of consent. The wife hasn't agreed to this manipulation, so it's a violation of her autonomy.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the husband should have communicated his concerns about the delays and worked with his wife to find a solution, rather than manipulating the situation behind her back. For example, discussing the snooze button issue, helping her set a realistic routine, or adjusting their schedule together. By doing this, he could have addressed the problem without deception.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the husband's actions are manipulative and deceptive, even if the intention is to prevent conflict. Therefore, he is in the wrong.\n"
