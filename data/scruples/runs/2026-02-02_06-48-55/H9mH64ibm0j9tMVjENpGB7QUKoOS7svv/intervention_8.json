We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe person is asking if they're the asshole for lying to their wife. The setup is that they and their wife drive to work together, but she's often late because she snoozes her alarm. The author wakes up at 6:30, sets her alarm ahead by 13 minutes (so she thinks it's correct), which gives her 35 minutes to get ready. In reality, her alarm is set earlier, but she snoozes twice, which adds up to 7 minutes each. The author then resets the alarm back to the correct time. The wife thinks she's improving her punctuality, but the author is lying to her about that. The question is whether this is controlling or manipulative, hence the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post.\n\nFirst, lying to a partner is generally not a good thing. Even though the author's intention might be to help her be on time, the method involves deception. The wife is being kept in the dark about the real reason she's managing to get ready on time. She thinks she's improving, but in reality, her partner is manipulating her alarm. That seems like a breach of trust. Trust is a cornerstone in relationships, and lying, even for what seems like a good reason, can erode that trust over time.\n\nAlso, the author is making decisions for the wife without her consent. The wife might have different preferences about her morning routine, and by adjusting her alarm without asking, the author is essentially making choices that affect her. This could be seen as controlling because it's about managing another person's behavior without their knowledge or agreement. The wife might not even be aware that she's being manipulated in this way, which is problematic.\n\nAnother angle to consider is the potential consequences if the wife finds out. Even if the author's intention was good, the wife might feel disrespected or betrayed. It's possible that she values her autonomy and would prefer to be honest about her time management issues, even if it means being late sometimes. The author's actions could lead to resentment or arguments if the truth comes out.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author's actions are a kind of white lie meant to prevent daily arguments. The motivation is to maintain peace and ensure they leave on time. But while the intention is to avoid conflict, the means of deception might not be justified. There are other ways to approach the problem, like discussing it openly with the wife and finding a solution together, such as adjusting the schedule, helping her with time management, or using another method that doesn't involve lying.\n\nThe fact that others in the subreddit called it controlling or manipulative supports the idea that the author is overstepping. Even if the outcome is positive (they leave on time), the method used is ethically questionable. Relationships require honesty and mutual respect, and manipulating someone's perception without their knowledge undermines that.\n\nIn summary, the author is lying to their wife for their own convenience, which is a form of manipulation. It's not about the outcome but the means. The deception here is unnecessary and could harm the relationship's trust and respect. So, the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
