We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for lying to his wife about adjusting her alarm. So the situation is that he's setting her alarm ahead by 13 minutes, making her think she has more time to get ready, which he does to avoid arguments about her being late. He then resets the alarm after she's in the shower.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key elements here. The main issue is deception. The wife believes she's improving in time management, but actually, the husband is manipulating the alarm. The question is whether this manipulation is justified or if it's wrong.\n\nThe user mentioned that others called it controlling and manipulative. The husband's intention is to prevent arguments and save time, but the method involves lying. Deception in a relationship can be problematic because it undermines trust. Even if the intention is good, the act of lying can have negative consequences. \n\nTrust is a cornerstone of any relationship. If the wife found out, she might feel that her autonomy is being violated. She's making decisions based on false information, thinking she's improving when she's not. This could lead to frustration later if she discovers the truth. Also, the husband isn't addressing the root problem\u2014maybe communication about her morning routine or adjusting their schedule differently.\n\nAnother angle: the husband is taking responsibility for a problem that could be a shared issue. Instead of discussing her reliance on the snooze button, he's handling it unilaterally. This approach might prevent arguments in the short term but could cause bigger issues if the deception is discovered. It's a form of manipulation, even if well-meaning.\n\nSo, even though the husband's motive is to reduce conflict and save time, the method involves deceit. The ethical consideration here is whether the ends justify the means. In relationships, honesty is crucial, and actions that breach trust, even for good reasons, can be considered wrong. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
