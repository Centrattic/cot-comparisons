We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong for lying to his wife about setting her alarm clock. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The couple works together and leaves at 7:35 AM. The wife has an alarm set for 6:45 but uses the snooze button twice, adding 14 minutes. The author wakes up at 6:30, sets her alarm 13 minutes ahead (which would make it go off at 6:58 instead of 6:45?), so she has enough time to get ready. Then he resets the alarm back after she starts her routine. The wife thinks she's been improving in getting ready faster, but the author is actually manipulating the time.\n\nSo the question is, is the author wrong for doing this? The user says they think he is, but wants others' opinions.\n\nHmm. Let's consider the ethics here. The author is lying by omission, right? He's not telling his wife the truth about her actual time to get ready. He's making her believe she's managing her time better than she actually is. This could be seen as manipulation because he's altering her perception. But he's doing it for a good reason\u2014to avoid arguments and ensure they leave on time. \n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to maintain harmony in the relationship by not causing daily conflicts. On the other hand, deception in a relationship, even with good intentions, can erode trust. If the wife found out, she might feel deceived, which could lead to bigger issues. Also, the author is making decisions for her without her consent, which could be seen as controlling. \n\nThe key points here are consent and honesty. In a healthy relationship, partners should be honest with each other. Even if the intention is good, lying can lead to problems. The author's actions might prevent immediate arguments but could create long-term issues if discovered. \n\nAlso, the term \"little white lie\" is used, but this isn't a harmless lie. It's a consistent lie that affects the wife's perception of her own time management. It's more about manipulating her routine without her knowledge. \n\nSo, considering these factors, the author is likely in the wrong because he's being dishonest, manipulating her situation without her knowledge, and not respecting her autonomy. Even though the intention is to help, the method is unethical.\n"
