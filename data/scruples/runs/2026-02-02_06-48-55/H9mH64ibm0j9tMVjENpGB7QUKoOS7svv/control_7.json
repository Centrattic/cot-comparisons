We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for lying to his wife about setting her alarm earlier. The situation is that he's been setting her alarm 13 minutes ahead so she has enough time to get ready, and then resetting it after she leaves for the shower. He's been doing this for months, and she thinks she's improved with punctuality, not knowing he's been manipulating the alarm.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The main issue here is deception. The husband is lying to his wife by not telling her the truth about her alarm. He's doing it to prevent arguments over her being late. The question is whether this deception is justified or if it's wrong.\n\nOn one hand, the husband's intention seems good. He wants to avoid arguments and help his wife be on time. The method he uses is a \"white lie,\" which he believes is harmless. He's not stealing or harming, just adjusting the alarm. But on the other hand, lying in a relationship can erode trust. Even if it's a small lie, it's still a breach of honesty. The wife has the right to know the truth, especially about something that affects her daily routine and self-perception.\n\nAlso, consider the power dynamics. By manipulating the alarm, he's making decisions for her without her knowledge or consent. It could be seen as controlling, as he's altering her environment to fit his schedule. Even if it's well-meaning, it's not respecting her autonomy. She's not able to make informed choices about her time management because the information is false.\n\nAnother angle is the consequences. The wife's belief that she's improved might be false. If she were aware of the truth, she might have taken steps to manage her time better on her own. The husband's action is preventing her from developing her own time management skills. In the long run, this could lead to dependency or issues when the deception is discovered.\n\nThe Reddit comments mentioned that people called it controlling or manipulative. That's a red flag. Even if the intention is good, the action is deceitful. Trust is fundamental in relationships, and this kind of deception can lead to bigger problems. The husband should have addressed the issue openly with his wife instead of resorting to a lie.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the husband's actions, while possibly well-intentioned, are a form of deception that undermines trust and autonomy. Therefore, the answer would be that he is in the wrong.\n"
