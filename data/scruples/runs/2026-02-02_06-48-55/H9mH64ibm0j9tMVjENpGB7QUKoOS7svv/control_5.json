We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about lying to their wife by adjusting her alarm clock to make her think she's improving in getting up on time.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The husband wakes up at 6:30, she at 6:45. She hits snooze twice (7 minutes each), so her alarm is set ahead by 13 minutes. He sets it back after she's in the shower. She thinks she's getting ready in 15 minutes, but actually has 35. He praises her when she comments on improving. People on Reddit called it controlling or manipulative. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nHmm. So, the main issue here is deception. The husband is intentionally making his wife believe she's improving by adjusting her alarm time. This is a lie. The wife is unaware of his actions and the real reason she's not late. \n\nIs this manipulative? Manipulation often involves influencing someone in a deceptive or underhanded way. By setting her alarm forward, he's making her think she has less time, so she's getting ready faster than she actually is. Then he gives her false praise, reinforcing the lie. This could be seen as controlling because he's managing their schedule without transparency. \n\nBut wait, he mentions that they had arguments about her being late before. So maybe he's trying to avoid conflict. However, the solution he chose is deception. Even if his intention is good, the method is questionable. Honesty is usually the cornerstone of a healthy relationship. Lying, even a \"white lie,\" can erode trust if discovered. \n\nPeople might argue that he's being considerate by not wanting to hurt her feelings, but the lie is ongoing and he's maintaining it for months. The wife might feel betrayed if she finds out, especially since she's been praised for improving when in reality, she's been getting more time. \n\nAlso, controlling behavior is about exerting unnecessary influence over someone else's actions. By manipulating the alarm, he's dictating her routine without her knowledge. It's possible that a better approach would be to communicate openly about the time issues, perhaps find a solution together. \n\nThe Reddit comments called it controlling and manipulative, which suggests that many people see it that way. While the husband's intention might not be malicious, the action involves deceit and could be seen as a violation of trust. \n\nIn relationships, transparency is important. Even if the lie is small, it's not ethical to deceive a partner in this way. The husband should have addressed the issue directly instead of resorting to a covert solution. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because his actions, though perhaps well-intentioned, involve deception and manipulation, which are not acceptable in a healthy relationship.\n"
