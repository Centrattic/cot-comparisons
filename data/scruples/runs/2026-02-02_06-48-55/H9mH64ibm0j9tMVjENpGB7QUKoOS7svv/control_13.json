We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by lying to his wife about adjusting her alarm. Hmm. So the situation is that they both drive to work together. The wife has a habit of hitting the snooze button, which causes her to be late. The husband sets her alarm 13 minutes ahead so she thinks she has more time, then resets it after she showers. He's lying about her being punctual when she actually isn't. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The husband is manipulating the situation to make his wife believe she's improving when she's not. The key points are deception and consent. The wife isn't aware of the manipulation, so she's being lied to. Even though the intention is to avoid arguments and help her manage her time better, the method involves dishonesty.\n\nPeople might argue that it's a harmless lie to prevent stress. But others could see it as manipulative because he's controlling her schedule without her knowledge. The wife's autonomy is affected since she doesn't have accurate information about her time management. If she knew the truth, she might want to adjust her routine or address the underlying issues, like her snoozing habit.\n\nAlso, the husband's actions could build up resentment if the wife found out. Trust is a big part of a relationship, and lying, even for good reasons, can erode that. The fact that others called it controlling makes sense because he's making decisions for her without her input. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband might not have a malicious intent. He just wants to avoid conflicts and ensure they leave on time. But the means he uses involve deception, which is a problem. The right approach might have been to communicate openly about the issue and find a solution together, rather than secretly altering her alarm.\n\nSo, weighing the intentions against the actions, the deception is the main issue here. Even if the outcome is beneficial, the method is ethically questionable. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong because he lied despite good intentions, which violates his wife's trust and autonomy.\n"
