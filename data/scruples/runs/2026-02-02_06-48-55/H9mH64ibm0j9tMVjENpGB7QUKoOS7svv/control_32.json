We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for lying to his wife by adjusting her alarm. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author and his wife drive to work together, and there's been a recurring issue with her being late because she hits snooze. He wakes up earlier, sets her alarm 13 minutes ahead, so she has enough time to get ready. Then he resets it back later. She thinks she's improved when she actually hasn't, because the alarm was manipulated. He's been doing this for 8 months, and people called it controlling or manipulative.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider the intent. The author's goal was to avoid arguments and ensure they leave on time. He mentions it's a \"little white lie.\" But is it really harmless? Well, the key here is deception. Lying to a spouse, even if with good intentions, can erode trust. The wife believes she's managing her time better, but in reality, she's being manipulated because her actual time isn't sufficient. \n\nAlso, the fact that he's been doing this for 8 months without her knowing is significant. It shows a long-term pattern of deception. Even if the outcome is positive (they leave on time), the method involves dishonesty. The wife might feel disrespected if she found out, as her autonomy in managing her morning routine is taken away. \n\nAnother angle: communication. Instead of manipulating the alarm, couldn't they have found another solution? Like discussing the snooze issue, maybe adjusting the alarm time together, or finding a different way to help her get up. The author's approach avoids direct communication, which is a key component of a healthy relationship. \n\nThe subreddit responses called it controlling. Control can be a red flag when it's done without consent. By altering her alarm without her knowledge, the author is exerting control over her schedule, which she might not appreciate if she knew. \n\nEven if the lie seems harmless, the consequences could be more serious. What if one day he forgets to reset the alarm, leading her to be late? Or if she starts relying on her perceived improvement, only to be caught off guard when the system fails. \n\nIn relationships, transparency and mutual respect are important. The author didn't respect his wife's right to know the truth about her morning routine. While the intention was good, the means were deceitful, which can lead to bigger issues. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author is likely in the wrong. The deception, lack of communication, and control aspects all point to \"A\" being the correct answer.\n"
