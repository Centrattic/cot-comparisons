We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is about lying to his wife by setting her alarm ahead to make her think she's improving with punctuality when actually she's not. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is manipulating the alarm time to create a false perception that the wife is getting better at managing her time. He does this to avoid arguments about her being late. He also takes pride in his wife's perceived improvement, which she attributes to her own efforts.\n\nNow, the question is whether this is wrong. From a moral standpoint, honesty is usually valued in relationships. The author is intentionally deceiving his wife, which could be seen as manipulative. Even though his intention is to prevent arguments and maybe help her feel better, the act of lying undermines trust. Trust is crucial in a marriage, and if the wife found out, it might cause more significant issues than the daily arguments they were avoiding.\n\nAlso, the author's method involves controlling her schedule without her knowledge. This could be considered controlling behavior. While the intent might be good, the means are deceptive. The subreddit comments mentioned that some people called it controlling or manipulative, which adds another layer. Even if the outcome seems positive (no arguments, she feels good), the method is ethically questionable.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that the lie is harmless and that the end result is beneficial. However, the potential harm lies in the breach of trust. If the wife discovers the deception, it could lead to feelings of betrayal. Additionally, the lie prevents her from addressing the real issue\u2014her time management\u2014which might be perpetuating the problem instead of solving it. \n\nIn relationships, transparency is important. The author should have addressed the problem directly, maybe by discussing the issue with his wife and finding a solution together, rather than using a deceptive method. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because his actions involve deceit and manipulation, even if the intentions are to reduce conflict and help his wife feel better.\n"
