We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for lying to his wife by adjusting her alarm. So, first, I need to understand the situation. The husband and wife drive to work together, and the wife used to be late because of hitting snooze. The husband sets her alarm 13 minutes ahead so she thinks she has 35 minutes to get ready, but when she hits snooze twice, it gives her the correct time. He then resets the alarm back. The wife believes she's improved, but it's actually because of the manipulated alarm.\n\nNow, the key points here are deception and manipulation. The husband is intentionally lying to his wife about the alarm time. The question is whether this is wrong. The user's own comment says he called it a \"little white lie,\" but others in the subreddit called it controlling or manipulative.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, honesty is usually important. Deception, even if well-intentioned, can erode trust. The husband is making decisions without the wife's knowledge or consent. Even if the intention is to help her get ready on time, the method involves deception. The wife is unaware of the manipulation, which could lead to issues if discovered. Also, the husband is taking control of her schedule without her input, which could be seen as controlling behavior. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband's goal is practical\u2014they need to leave on time for work. The lie prevents arguments and avoids the wife being late. But the ethical issue here is whether the ends justify the means. While the intention is good, the method involves deceit. In most ethical frameworks, deception without consent is considered wrong, even if the motive is benign. \n\nAdditionally, the husband is taking responsibility for a problem that could be addressed through open communication. Instead of setting the alarm himself, he could have discussed the issue with his wife to find a solution they both agree on. For example, maybe she could set her own alarm correctly or they could adjust their routine together. His approach bypasses communication, which might be a better long-term solution.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the husband's actions, while perhaps well-meaning, involve manipulation and deception, which are generally considered unethical in relationships. Therefore, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
