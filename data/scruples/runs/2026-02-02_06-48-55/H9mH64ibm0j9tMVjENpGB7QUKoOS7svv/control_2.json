We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for lying to their wife about adjusting her alarm. So the situation is that the husband sets her alarm 13 minutes ahead so she can get ready on time, then resets it back once she's up. The wife thinks she's improved with time management, but he's actually manipulating her schedule. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the key points here. The husband is being dishonest. He's lying about the alarm time, which is a form of deception. The wife isn't aware that her alarm was manipulated. The husband's intention might be good\u2014to help her avoid being late and reduce arguments. But the method involves deception. \n\nNow, considering the ethical angle: honesty is generally valued in relationships. Even if the intention is good, lying can erode trust. The wife might feel betrayed if she finds out. Also, the husband is making decisions for her without her consent. Even if the outcome is positive (she's not late), the lack of transparency is problematic. \n\nThe responses from the subreddit called it controlling and manipulative. That's a common perspective. But some might argue that it's a small lie with a good outcome. However, the principle of honesty is important. Relationships require trust, and this kind of deception, even if minor, could lead to bigger issues. \n\nAnother angle: the husband could have communicated the problem and found a solution together. Maybe they could have agreed on a better alarm time or adjusted their routines. Instead, he took matters into his own hands without discussing it. That's a lack of collaboration and respect for her autonomy.\n\nSo, even though the intention is to help, the method is deceptive. The wife has the right to know how her schedule is being managed. The husband's actions prevent her from making informed decisions about her time. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because the deception undermines trust and respect in the relationship.\n"
