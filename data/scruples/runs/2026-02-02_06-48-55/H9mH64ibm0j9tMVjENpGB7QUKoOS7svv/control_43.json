We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author has been secretly adjusting his wife's alarm clock to make her think she's improving at not being late. The wife thinks she's getting better because the alarm is set ahead, but he's actually resetting it to the correct time after she wakes up. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The author is lying by omission and manipulating the situation without his wife's knowledge. Even though the intention seems good\u2014helping her avoid arguments and feel better\u2014deception is involved. \n\nThe key points are: he's altering her alarm without her consent, leading her to believe she's improving when she's not. The wife's perception of her own punctuality is based on a lie. This could be seen as manipulative because he's controlling the situation without her knowledge or agreement. \n\nPeople on the internet who commented called it controlling and manipulative, which are serious accusations. Even if the outcome is positive (fewer arguments, her feeling good), the method involves dishonesty. In relationships, trust is crucial, and any form of deceit, even if well-meaning, can erode that trust. \n\nThe author's defense is that it's a \"little white lie,\" but the impact might be more significant than he realizes. If the wife found out, she might feel betrayed. Also, it's about time management; maybe there's a better way to approach the problem without deception.\n\nConsidering these factors, the author is indeed in the wrong because the action involves deception and manipulation without consent, which are generally considered unethical in a relationship.\n"
