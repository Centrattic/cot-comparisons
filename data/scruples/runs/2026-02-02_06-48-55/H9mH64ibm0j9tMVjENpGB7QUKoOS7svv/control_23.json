We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for lying to his wife by adjusting her alarm. The situation is that they drive to work together, and the wife is often late because she snoozes. The husband sets her alarm 13 minutes ahead so she thinks she has 35 minutes, but actually has 48. He does this so she can get ready without being late, and he lies when she says she's improved.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The husband is manipulating the time on the alarm without his wife's knowledge. Even if the intent is good\u2014to prevent arguments and ensure they leave on time\u2014deception is involved. Lying, even a \"white lie,\" can erode trust in a relationship. Trust is fundamental, and if the wife found out, she might feel betrayed. Also, manipulating someone's perception without their consent can be seen as controlling. The husband isn't addressing the root issue (maybe they need to leave earlier, or the wife needs a different routine) but instead is using a deceptive method. People might argue that it's a kind act, but the method is problematic. The key points here are deception, lack of consent, and potential control. Even if the outcome is positive, the means are questionable. So, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because the deceit, even well-intentioned, is manipulative and could harm the relationship's trust.\n"
