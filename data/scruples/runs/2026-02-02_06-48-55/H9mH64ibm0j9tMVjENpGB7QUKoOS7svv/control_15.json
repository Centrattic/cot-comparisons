We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that he's been setting his wife's alarm 13 minutes ahead every morning so she thinks she has enough time to get ready, but he's actually giving her less time. He does this so she doesn't get late for work, and he gets the coffee started. He's been doing this for 8 months, and she's been happy about improving her punctuality. But people are saying it's controlling or manipulative.\n\nHmm. Well, the key here is whether lying to a spouse for what you think is their benefit crosses a line. The author's intention is to help her avoid being late, but he's doing it by deception. Even if the outcome is positive, the method involves lying. Trust is a big part of any relationship, and deception, even if well-intentioned, can erode that trust. The fact that he's been doing this for months without her knowing might be a problem. If she found out, she might feel manipulated. The wife's autonomy is important; she has the right to make her own decisions about her time and schedule. By adjusting her alarm without her knowledge, he's taking control of her routine. Even if it's for a good reason, the lack of transparency could be seen as wrong. Also, the arguments about being late are gone because of his manipulation, but maybe they should have addressed the root cause together, like setting a realistic schedule. So, I think the answer is A, the author is in the wrong because the action is deceitful and undermines trust.\n"
