We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author lying to his wife about setting her alarm clock ahead by 13 minutes to prevent her from being late. The wife thinks she's improved, but the author is secretly adjusting the time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what's wrong here. The main issue is deception. The author is manipulating the wife's perception of her time. Even though the intention is good\u2014avoiding arguments and helping her get ready on time\u2014the method involves lying and not being honest. \n\nTrust is a big factor in relationships. If the wife found out, she might feel betrayed because he didn't consult her. The author isn't controlling the situation for his benefit but for hers, but that doesn't make it right. The fact that others called it controlling or manipulative could be important. Even if the outcome is positive (she's not late), the means are dishonest.\n\nAlso, the author is making assumptions about what the wife can do with her time. Maybe she could manage her time better if she knew the truth. By lying, he's not addressing the root problem but hiding it. This could prevent her from taking responsibility for her own time management.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's intention is to reduce stress and arguments. But in relationships, honesty is usually valued over convenience. The lie, even if small, might erode trust over time. If the wife discovers the deception, it could lead to bigger issues. The author should have talked to her about the problem instead of handling it secretly.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is in the wrong because he's being dishonest and manipulating the wife's time without her knowledge or consent. The answer should be A.\n"
