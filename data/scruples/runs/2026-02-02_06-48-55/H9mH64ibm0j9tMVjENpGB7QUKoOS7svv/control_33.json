We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is lying to their wife about setting her alarm clock. They set it ahead by 13 minutes so she thinks she has 35 minutes to get ready, but actually, she only has 22 minutes (since they correct the alarm after she gets in the shower). The wife thinks she's improved at not being late, but the author is secretly making her think she has more time each day. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple used to argue about her being late, which is a problem they wanted to resolve. The author found a way to avoid arguments by manipulating the alarm time. But is lying the right approach here? The key points here are deception, consent, and the impact on the relationship.\n\nDeception is generally a red flag because honesty is a cornerstone of trust. Even if the intention is good (avoiding arguments and helping the wife be on time), the method is deceptive. The wife isn't aware that her alarm is being altered, so she's being manipulated without her consent. \n\nThe author's justification is that it's a \"white lie\" that benefits both parties. But white lies are usually considered harmless if they don't cause harm and are minor. However, in a relationship, trust is crucial. The author is manipulating their partner's perception without her knowledge, which could lead to bigger issues if discovered. Also, the wife's belief that she's improving is based on a lie, which might affect her self-perception in the long run. \n\nIf the wife found out, she might feel disrespected or betrayed. The author didn't discuss the problem with her to find a solution together, which is the healthy approach. Instead, they took unilateral action, which could be seen as controlling. The fact that others on the subreddit called it controlling and manipulative adds weight to the idea that the author's actions are problematic. \n\nEven if the outcome is positive (no arguments and she's on time), the method is ethically questionable. Relationships require open communication and mutual respect. By not being honest, the author is violating that trust. So, the answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong because the deception undermines the relationship's foundation, even if the intention was good.\n"
