We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for this situation. The scenario is about the author lying to their wife about setting her alarm clock forward by 13 minutes so she doesn't think she's late. They've been doing this for 8 months, and the wife thinks she's improved in her punctuality.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points here. The author is intentionally manipulating the alarm time, which affects the wife's perception of her own punctuality. The wife isn't aware of this manipulation. The author's intention seems to be to avoid arguments and make the wife feel better, but the method involves deception.\n\nNow, considering ethical implications. Lying, even if it's a \"white lie,\" can erode trust in a relationship. The wife is being misled about a daily routine that affects her perception of her own performance. Trust is a cornerstone in any relationship, and when one partner hides the truth, it can lead to bigger issues down the line. Even if there's no malicious intent, the act of deception is still a form of manipulation, as it's controlling the situation without the other person's knowledge or consent.\n\nAlso, the author is making decisions that affect both of them without consulting the wife. The underlying issue is about their commuting schedule and the wife's punctuality. Perhaps a better solution would be to communicate openly and find a mutual agreement. For example, adjusting their schedule to allow enough time or finding a way to help the wife manage her morning routine without deception.\n\nThe responses from the community mentioned that people called it controlling or manipulative. Those are strong terms, but there's some validity there. Controlling behavior often involves subtle actions that limit another person's autonomy without their awareness. By setting the alarm forward, the author is controlling the wife's time management in a way that's not honest.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author's intentions are good. They want to prevent arguments and support the wife's confidence. But the problem isn't the intention but the method. The harm comes from the deception rather than the intention. Even small lies can have significant consequences when they involve dishonesty in a relationship.\n\nAnother angle is the wife's perspective. If she discovers the truth, she might feel betrayed. Trust is hard to rebuild once broken. Also, the wife might have been making efforts to improve her punctuality, but she's actually not because the author is artificially adjusting the time. This could lead to frustration later when she realizes she wasn't actually improving, which could cause more arguments than the original issue.\n\nIn relationships, honesty is crucial. While the situation seems minor, it's about the principle. The author's actions, though perhaps well-meaning, are a form of deceit that undermines trust and autonomy. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
