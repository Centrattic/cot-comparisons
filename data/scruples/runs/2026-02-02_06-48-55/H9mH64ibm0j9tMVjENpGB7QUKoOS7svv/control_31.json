We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for lying to his wife by adjusting her alarm. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The husband sets his wife's alarm 13 minutes ahead so she thinks she has more time to get ready. This allows him to make coffee while she's in the shower, and he resets the alarm back. The wife thinks she's improved at not being late, but in reality, the alarm was manipulated. \n\nThe key points here are deception and consent. The husband is lying to his wife about the time, which affects her perception of her own punctuality. Lying, even if with good intentions, can erode trust. The wife isn't aware of the manipulation, so she's not giving consent to this arrangement. \n\nPeople might argue that it's a harmless white lie to avoid arguments. However, in a relationship, transparency is important. The husband is making decisions that affect his wife without her knowledge, which could be seen as controlling. The fact that he's been doing this for 8 months suggests it's an ongoing issue, not a one-time thing. \n\nAlso, the wife's feelings matter. Even if she's not aware of the deception, the husband is not being truthful, which could lead to issues down the line if discovered. The arguments they used to have are replaced by a lie, which might not address the root cause of the problem, like maybe the time they leave or the morning routine.\n\nSo, considering the ethical implications and the potential harm to the relationship, the husband is likely in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
