We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for lying to his wife by adjusting her alarm clock. The situation is that they drive to work together, and the wife often snoozes her alarm, leading to her being late. The husband sets her alarm 13 minutes ahead each morning so she thinks she has enough time, but he later corrects it. The wife believes she's improved, not knowing the alarm was manipulated.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The key issue is deception. The husband is intentionally lying to his wife by altering the alarm. Even if the intention is good\u2014to avoid arguments and help her be on time\u2014deception can be problematic in relationships. Trust is crucial, and if the wife found out, it might hurt her feelings because he didn't respect her autonomy or honesty.\n\nPeople on the subreddit called it controlling and manipulative, which are serious accusations. Even if the outcome is positive (they leave on time without arguments), the method used is dishonest. The husband's actions prevent the wife from addressing the real issue with her time management. Instead of helping her understand her actual time needs, he's covering for her habits through deceit.\n\nAnother angle is consent. The wife isn't aware of the manipulation, so she hasn't agreed to this arrangement. In a healthy relationship, partners should communicate openly about such issues rather than one person taking unilateral actions. The husband might have a good reason, but the lack of transparency is a red flag.\n\nPossible counterarguments could be that the husband's intention is to reduce stress and maintain harmony. However, the means justify the ends here. Honesty is a foundational element in relationships, and even \"white lies\" can erode trust over time. If the wife discovers the truth, it could lead to more significant issues than the daily arguments they're trying to avoid.\n\nAlso, the husband's solution doesn't address the root problem. Maybe the wife's morning routine could be adjusted, or they could discuss time management strategies together. By manipulating the alarm, he's not helping her develop better habits but instead enabling her to continue her current routine without realizing the time constraints.\n\nIn conclusion, while the intention may be good, the act of deception and manipulation undermines trust and respect in the relationship. The husband's actions are ethically questionable because they involve dishonesty and a lack of transparency, which are important in maintaining a healthy partnership. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
