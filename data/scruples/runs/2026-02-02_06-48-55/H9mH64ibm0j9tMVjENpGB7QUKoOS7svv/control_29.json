We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for lying to their wife about setting her alarm. The situation involves adjusting her alarm time each morning to ensure she leaves on time, which she believes she can manage on her own.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The author is manipulating the situation by changing the alarm's time without the wife's knowledge. While the intention might be to avoid arguments and help the wife get ready on time, the method involves deception. Trust is a fundamental part of any relationship, and lying, even for a \"good\" reason, can erode that trust. \n\nThe wife is under the impression that she's improving her punctuality, but in reality, the author is altering the alarm. This might lead to a false sense of accomplishment for her, which could be demotivating if she ever discovers the truth. The arguments they had before about being late might stem from different communication issues that weren't addressed, instead being bypassed through deception. \n\nThe author's actions could be seen as controlling because they're making a decision that affects the wife's daily routine without her consent. Even if the intention is to help, the lack of transparency here is problematic. The alternative could have been discussing the issue openly, perhaps adjusting their schedules together or finding another solution that both agree on. \n\nMany people on the subreddit labeled this as manipulative, which is a strong term but not unfounded. Manipulation often involves influencing someone in a way that's not honest or fair. The fact that the author feels the need to lie suggests that a more direct approach wasn't taken. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that the outcome is positive\u2014no more arguments, punctuality, and everyone leaves on time. However, the means justify the ends in relationships. Trust and honesty are crucial, and even small lies can have bigger consequences. \n\nIn conclusion, while the intention might be good, the method of achieving it through deceit is ethically questionable. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
