We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves him setting his wife's alarm clock ahead by 13 minutes every morning so she thinks she has 35 minutes to get ready, but actually has less. He then resets it after she starts her routine. The wife thinks she's improved at not being late, but the husband knows it's because of the manipulated time.\n\nSo, the question is whether lying to his wife in this way is wrong. The options are A (yes, he's wrong) or B (no, he's not). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The husband is deceiving his wife to make her believe she's more efficient than she is. Even though the intention might be to avoid arguments and ensure they leave on time, deception is usually a red flag in relationships. Trust is important, and lying, even small ones, can erode that trust.\n\nAlso, the husband is manipulating the situation without his wife's knowledge. The wife is being made to think her own time management has improved when it's actually the husband adjusting the alarm. This could be seen as controlling because he's taking control without her consent. \n\nSome might argue that the intention is good\u2014he wants to avoid conflict and help her be on time. However, the method is dishonest. There could be better ways to handle this, like setting her alarm correctly and helping her manage her time, or discussing the problem together. \n\nThe fact that the husband is proud of his little white lie and even shares it on Reddit suggests he's aware of the deception but justifies it. The responses from others calling it controlling and manipulative support the idea that this behavior is problematic. \n\nIn relationships, transparency is key. Secrets and lies, even if well-intentioned, can lead to bigger issues if discovered. The wife might feel betrayed once she finds out, which could damage the relationship more than the original problem of being late. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the husband is likely in the wrong because he's being deceptive and manipulating the situation without his wife's knowledge or consent. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n"
