We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for lying to his wife about setting her alarm. The situation is that they drive to work together, and the wife often gets late because she snoozes. The husband sets her alarm 13 minutes ahead so she thinks she's getting ready for 35 minutes, but actually, she's only getting 22 minutes. He then resets it after she's in the shower. He lies to her about her improvement in punctuality.\n\nFirst, the key issue here is the deception. The husband is manipulating the time without her knowledge, which affects her routine. Even though the intention might be to help her avoid being late, the method involves a lie. Trust is a big part of a relationship, and this kind of manipulation, even if well-intentioned, can erode that trust. The wife isn't aware of the true circumstances, so she's basing her actions on false information. \n\nThe other aspect is autonomy. The wife should have control over her own schedule and decisions. By adjusting her alarm without her knowledge, the husband is taking away her ability to make informed choices about her morning routine. This could be seen as controlling or paternalistic. \n\nThe responses from others calling it controlling or manipulative make sense here. While the husband's intention is to help, the method is deceptive and undermines the wife's autonomy. Even if the outcomes are positive (she's not late), the means used are ethically questionable. \n\nSo, considering these points, the author is in the wrong. The deception and manipulation, despite good intentions, are harmful to the relationship's trust and respect. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n"
