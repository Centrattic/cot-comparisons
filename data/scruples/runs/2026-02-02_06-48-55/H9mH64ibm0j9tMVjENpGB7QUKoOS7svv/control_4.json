We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for lying to their wife by adjusting her alarm. The situation is that they set her alarm ahead by 13 minutes each day so she thinks she has enough time to get ready, but in reality, they fix the alarm after she's up. The wife then believes she's improved at not being late, when really it's all because of the manipulated alarm.\n\nHmm, the user is justifying it as a \"little white lie\" to avoid arguments. But lying to someone in a relationship, even if the intention is good, can be problematic. Trust is important, and if the wife found out, she might feel deceived. The fact that the husband is manipulating her schedule without her knowledge seems like a form of manipulation. Also, instead of lying, maybe there's a better way to handle the issue, like communicating openly about the problem of her being late and finding a mutual solution. The arguments they used to have were probably because of the lateness, but lying isn't the solution. It might cause bigger issues if she ever discovers the truth. The Reddit community's reaction also labeled it as controlling and manipulative, which makes sense. So, I think the author is in the wrong here. The answer should be A.\n"
