We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for lying to his wife about setting her alarm. \n\nFirst, the situation: The husband and wife drive to work together. The wife used to be late because of snoozing. The husband sets her alarm 13 minutes ahead so she thinks she has more time, but in reality, it's adjusted back later. The wife believes she's improved, but the husband is lying about her progress.\n\nSo, the key points here are deception and the intent behind it. The husband is actively manipulating her alarm time to make her think she's better at managing her time. He's not just helping her; he's lying to her about her own habits. \n\nNow, considering the context of their relationship. In a healthy relationship, honesty is crucial. Even if the intention is good, lying can erode trust. The husband's actions are a form of manipulation because he's controlling her perception without her knowledge. \n\nArguments against the husband might say that while he's trying to solve a problem, the method is dishonest. The wife deserves to know the truth to make informed decisions. Plus, the husband is taking credit for her perceived improvement, which isn't real. \n\nOn the other hand, some might see it as a harmless lie to avoid daily arguments. But the subreddit comments called it controlling, which is a red flag. Controlling behavior often starts small but can escalate. Even if it's a \"white lie,\" it's still a lie that affects her autonomy. \n\nThe wife's ability to manage her time is being undermined. She's not actually improving; the system is just making it seem that way. This could prevent her from developing real habits to be on time. If the husband stops, she might be unprepared, leading to bigger issues. \n\nAlso, communication is key. Instead of lying, they should have discussed the problem and found a solution together, like adjusting the schedule or helping her without deception. \n\nIn conclusion, the husband's actions are deceptive and manipulative, even if well-intentioned. The wrong is there because of breach of trust and undermining the wife's autonomy. So the answer should be A.\n"
