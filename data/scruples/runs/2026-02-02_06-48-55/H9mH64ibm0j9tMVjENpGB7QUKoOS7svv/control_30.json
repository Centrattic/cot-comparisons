We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about lying to his wife by adjusting her alarm clock to make her think she's improving in punctuality.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the scenario step by step. The man and his wife commute together, and she used to be late because of snoozing. He sets her alarm 13 minutes ahead so she has more time, then sets it back after she showers. She believes her time management has improved, but in reality, he's manipulating the clock. He answers her comments with false praise.\n\nNow, the key points here are deception and manipulation. The husband is lying repeatedly, making his wife believe she's improving when she isn't. The question is whether this is wrong. \n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. Lies, even if well-intentioned, can erode that trust. The husband's action might be seen as a power imbalance. He's making decisions about her schedule without her consent, which could be considered controlling. The subreddit comments mentioned \"controlling/manipulative,\" which are serious accusations.\n\nHowever, the husband's intention was to help her avoid arguments and improve punctuality. His actions might be seen as a solution to a problem they had. But the method involved deception, which is problematic. Even if the outcome was positive (no arguments), the means were dishonest.\n\nAnother angle: the wife might have appreciated the help if she knew, but since she was lied to, she might feel betrayed if discovered. The husband didn't discuss this with her, which is a breach of communication. In healthy relationships, transparency is important. \n\nSo, considering all that, the husband's actions are deceitful and undermine trust. Even if the intention was good, the method is ethically questionable. Most people would likely side with the subreddit comments, considering it controlling. Therefore, the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
