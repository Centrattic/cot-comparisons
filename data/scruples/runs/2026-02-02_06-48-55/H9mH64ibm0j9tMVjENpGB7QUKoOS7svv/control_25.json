We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that he's been lying to his wife about setting her alarm clock to make her leave earlier so she doesn't get late for work. He adjusts the alarm forward by 13 minutes each morning, then resets it after she's in the shower. The wife thinks she's improved her punctuality, but he's actually manipulating the time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Lying to someone, even for a good reason, can be a gray area. The husband's intention is to prevent arguments and help his wife be on time. But the method he uses is deception. Honesty is a cornerstone of trust in relationships. If someone finds out they were lied to, even if the lie was well-intentioned, it can cause hurt feelings or a breach of trust. \n\nThe other aspect is consent. The wife isn't aware of the manipulation, so she hasn't agreed to this. Even if the outcome is positive (she's on time), the lack of transparency is a problem. Also, the husband is using a \"white lie\" defense, but some people argue that any lie is a violation, especially when it affects someone else's perception of their own actions.\n\nPeople might say it's controlling because he's altering her routine without her knowledge. Others might think it's a clever solution to a daily problem. However, the key issue is whether the ends justify the means. While the intention is good, the method of deception could be seen as manipulative. \n\nIn relationships, open communication is important. If the husband had discussed the issue with his wife, maybe they could have found a mutual solution without lying. Now, if this is discovered, it could lead to bigger issues. The fact that others on the subreddit labeled it as controlling or manipulative suggests that the community sees it as unethical. \n\nSo putting it all together, even if the motivation is good, the act of lying and manipulating without consent is likely to be considered wrong. The husband's actions undermine trust and autonomy, which are important in a healthy relationship. Therefore, the answer would be that he is in the wrong.\n"
