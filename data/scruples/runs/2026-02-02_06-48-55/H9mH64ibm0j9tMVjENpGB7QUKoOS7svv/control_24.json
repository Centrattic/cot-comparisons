We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about lying to their wife about setting her alarm clock. The husband sets her alarm ahead by 13 minutes so she doesn't realize the actual time she's getting up. He does this to avoid arguments about her being late. He mentions doing this for 8 months and even lying to her about her improvements.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The main issue is deception. The husband is actively lying to his wife by manipulating the alarm time and not correcting her perception of her morning routine efficiency. He's not being honest about her actual time management. \n\nNow, the question is whether this makes him the asshole. The possible angles are control, manipulation, and respect in the relationship. On one hand, he's trying to prevent arguments and help her feel better, which might come from a place of wanting to avoid conflict. On the other hand, he's not being truthful, which could erode trust if discovered. \n\nThe community in the subreddit might have called him controlling or manipulative because he's making decisions for her without her knowledge or consent. Even though his intentions are good, the method of deception could be problematic. Honesty is usually valued in relationships, and lying about something that affects her daily routine might be seen as crossing a line. \n\nAlso, the fact that he's been doing this for 8 months suggests that the deception is ongoing. If she found out, she might feel betrayed or like her husband isn't respecting her autonomy. Even if she's improved in her perception, she wasn't aware of the real reasons behind her changes. \n\nI should also consider the potential consequences. If the lie is discovered, it could lead to bigger issues than the initial problem. The husband might be avoiding conflict in the short term but causing deeper issues in the long run. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the husband's actions, while possibly well-intentioned, involve deception and manipulation without the wife's consent. This makes him the asshole because he's not respecting her honesty and autonomy, even if the goal was to help the relationship in the short term. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
