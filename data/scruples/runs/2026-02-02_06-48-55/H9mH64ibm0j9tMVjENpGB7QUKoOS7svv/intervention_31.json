We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for lying to their wife about setting her alarm clock 13 minutes ahead. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author and his wife have a routine where they leave at 7:35. The wife is often late because she snoozes her alarm twice, each snooze being 7 minutes. The author wakes up earlier, sets her alarm ahead by 13 minutes, which gives him a bit of time to get the coffee going. Then, after she's in the shower, he sets it back. The wife believes she only takes 15 minutes to get ready, but in reality, she has 35 minutes. The author has been doing this for 8 months and sometimes lies about her improving on time.\n\nSo, the key points here are the deception and the manipulation of the wife's perception. The author is altering her alarm time without her knowledge. Even though the intention might be to help her get ready on time and avoid arguments, the method involves a lie and a bit of trickery. The author is making decisions for his wife without her consent, which can be seen as controlling. \n\nNow, considering the responses from the subreddit, many people called it controlling or manipulative. That suggests that others see this as a problem. The author is not being honest with his wife about the time she actually has, which could undermine trust. Even if the outcome is positive (she's not late), the means used are deceptive. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author's intention is good. He wants to avoid arguments and ensure they leave on time. But the way he's doing it is by lying and manipulating the situation without transparency. In a healthy relationship, partners should communicate openly about such things. Instead of setting the alarm ahead and lying, he could have discussed the issue with his wife and found a solution together, like adjusting the alarm time with her agreement. \n\nAnother angle is autonomy. The wife should have the right to manage her own time and understand her own routine. By manipulating the alarm, the author is taking away her ability to make informed decisions about her morning routine. It's a form of micromanagement without her knowledge. \n\nIn terms of ethics, deception is generally frowned upon unless it's to prevent harm. But here, the deception is to maintain a false perception that she's improving, which might make her feel good, but it's not truthful. The author might be avoiding conflict by not confronting her about her lateness, but that's not addressing the root issue. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is using a dishonest method to manage a shared routine without the other person's consent. That's manipulative and controlling. The answer would be that he is in the wrong.\n"
