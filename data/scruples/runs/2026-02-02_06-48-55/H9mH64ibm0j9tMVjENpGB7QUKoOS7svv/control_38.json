We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for lying to his wife by adjusting her alarm. The situation is that he sets her alarm ahead by 13 minutes so she wakes up earlier, thinking she's improving in punctuality when in reality he's manipulating the time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral aspects here. The husband is intentionally deceiving his wife. Even though the intention is to prevent arguments and help her be on time, deception is involved. The wife isn't aware that her alarm is being set incorrectly. The husband's actions are meant to make her believe she's being more punctual than she actually is. \n\nOn one hand, the husband's motivation might be good\u2014to avoid conflicts and ensure they leave on time. However, the method he uses is deceptive. Trust is a crucial component in a relationship, and manipulating the alarm time undermines that trust. Even if the outcome is positive (they leave on time), the means involve dishonesty. \n\nPeople might argue that it's a small lie and with good intentions, but the fact remains that the wife is being misled. The husband is taking control of her schedule without her knowledge or consent. This could be seen as manipulative because he's altering her routine to fit his own needs without her being aware. \n\nAdditionally, the husband's approach doesn't address the root problem. Instead of communicating with his wife about their schedule and finding a solution together, he takes matters into his own hands. A healthier approach would involve discussing the issue openly and finding a mutually agreeable solution, like adjusting her alarm time permanently or setting a different routine that works for both.\n\nThe responses from the subreddit also mentioned that people considered it controlling or manipulative. Those are strong terms, but they highlight the concern about the husband's unilateral decisions affecting his wife without her consent. Even if the intention is good, the method is ethically questionable.\n\nIn relationships, transparency is key. The husband's actions, while well-meaning, could lead to a breakdown in trust if discovered. It's possible that if the wife finds out, she might feel disrespected or that her autonomy was violated. The fact that he's \"lying\" about her improvement reinforces the manipulation aspect, as he's not only altering the alarm but also misrepresenting her progress.\n\nSo, putting it all together, while the intention might be to help, the method involves deception and manipulation without consent. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
