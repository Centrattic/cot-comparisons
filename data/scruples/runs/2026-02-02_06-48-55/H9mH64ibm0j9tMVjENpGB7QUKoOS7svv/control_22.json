We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. Let me read through the scenario again.\n\nThe author is lying to his wife about setting her alarm clock ahead by 13 minutes to make her think she's improving in her morning routine. He does this so she leaves on time, avoiding arguments. He admits to lying and says it's a \"white lie.\" The main points are: he's manipulating her perception, keeping it a secret, and she's unaware of his actions for months.\n\nFirst, I need to consider different perspectives. On one hand, the author is trying to prevent arguments and help his wife be on time, which seems well-intentioned. He's not causing harm directly, just adjusting the alarm. But the key issue is deception. Even if the intention is good, lying to a spouse about something they consider a personal habit can be problematic. Trust is a big component in relationships. If she finds out, she might feel betrayed, especially since he's been doing this for months without her knowing.\n\nAlso, there's the aspect of autonomy. The wife's perception of her own ability to manage her time is being artificially maintained. She's not actually improving; she's just being given a false sense of it. This could prevent her from developing better habits if she had real feedback. Maybe she needs to learn to manage her time without the artificial buffer.\n\nAnother angle is the lack of communication. Instead of lying, the author could have talked to his wife about the problem and found a solution together. They could have addressed the snooze button issue or adjusted their schedules. By not doing that, he's avoiding a direct conversation, which might be necessary for a healthy relationship.\n\nThe responses from the subreddit called it controlling and manipulative. Even if the author doesn't see it that way, the act of secretly altering her alarm and lying about her progress could be seen as undermining her autonomy. Control in relationships can erode trust, even if the motive is to help.\n\nHowever, some might argue that it's a small lie with no malicious intent and that it's preventing daily conflicts. But the line between a harmless lie and manipulation can be thin. The fact that he's been doing it for 8 months suggests that it's a long-term deception, which might have more serious implications than a one-off white lie.\n\nIn conclusion, while the intention might be good, the method of deception and the impact on trust and autonomy likely mean the author is in the wrong. The right approach would have been to communicate and find a solution together rather than maintaining a lie.\n"
