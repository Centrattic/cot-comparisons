We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is the asshole for lying to his wife by adjusting her alarm to make her think she's improving in terms of punctuality. \n\nFirst, the situation: The couple lives together and drives to work. The wife has a habit of hitting snooze, which causes her to be late. The author sets her alarm 13 minutes early to give her enough time to get ready, then resets it later. The wife believes she's improved her punctuality because she's not late, not realizing her alarm was manipulated.\n\nThe key points here are deception and consent. The author is intentionally misleading his wife by altering her alarm without her knowledge. Even though the intention is to help her avoid arguments and lateness, the act itself is a lie. The wife is being kept in the dark, which can erode trust. \n\nLying for what seems like a good reason can still be problematic. Relationships require honesty and transparency. By not being truthful, the author isn't allowing his wife to make informed decisions. If she knew the truth, maybe she'd adjust her habits or they could find another solution together. The fact that he's reinforcing her belief that she's improved, when in reality she's not, could lead to complacency. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that people called him controlling or manipulative. Those are strong terms, but the behavior does involve manipulating the situation without the other person's consent. Even if the outcome is positive (no arguments), the method is ethically questionable. \n\nSo, considering that the lie is ongoing and the wife isn't aware of the manipulation, the author is indeed in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
