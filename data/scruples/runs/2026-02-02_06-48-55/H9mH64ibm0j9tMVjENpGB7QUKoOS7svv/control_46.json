We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for lying to his wife about setting her alarm. The situation is that they both drive to work together, and the wife used to be late because of snoozing. The husband sets her alarm 13 minutes ahead so she thinks she has 35 minutes, but in reality, she only has 22 minutes. He does this because he wants to avoid morning arguments. He then resets the alarm back after she's in the shower.\n\nSo, the question is whether this is a white lie or manipulation. The people in the subreddit called him controlling or manipulative. The user is asking if the author is the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intent. The husband's intention is to prevent arguments and help his wife get ready on time. However, the method involves deception. The wife is being misled about the actual time she has, which could affect her ability to manage her morning routine. Even if it's for a good reason, lying in a relationship can erode trust. \n\nIn relationships, honesty is a key component. If one person is making decisions for the other without their knowledge or consent, especially in a way that affects their daily life, it can be seen as controlling. The wife's autonomy is being compromised here. She's not aware that her alarm is being adjusted, which means she can't make informed choices about her time. \n\nAlso, the fact that the husband is doing this for months without her knowing might indicate that he didn't consider her feelings or autonomy. While the outcome is positive (no arguments, she's not late), the means are deceitful. Even if the intention is good, the act of lying can have negative consequences if discovered. The wife might feel betrayed or manipulated once she finds out, leading to bigger issues in the relationship.\n\nAnother angle is problem-solving. Instead of manipulating the situation, the couple could have discussed the issue openly. The husband could have suggested a different alarm time or a morning routine that works for both of them. The fact that he chose to lie instead of communicating suggests a lack of trust in her ability to handle the situation, which is a red flag in a relationship.\n\nSo, putting it all together, even though the intention is to help, the method is deceptive and controlling. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
