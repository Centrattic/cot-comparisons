We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about someone lying to their wife by adjusting her alarm clock. The author sets her alarm 13 minutes ahead so she thinks she has 35 minutes to get ready, but in reality, she only has 22 minutes. The wife believes she's improving with punctuality, but the author is actually manipulating the time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The lie is to prevent arguments about her being late. The author's intention is to avoid conflict and ensure they leave on time. However, the method is deceptive. The wife isn't aware of the manipulation, so she's making decisions based on false information.\n\nDeception in relationships can be tricky. On one hand, the author's actions are meant to help the wife feel better about her punctuality. On the other hand, honesty is crucial in a relationship. Lying, even for a good reason, might erode trust if discovered. The author's lie is a form of manipulation, controlling the wife's perception without her consent.\n\nAlso, the author mentions the wife comments on improving, which makes the lie more insidious. The wife's confidence in her time management is based on false premises. If the wife found out, she might feel disrespected or manipulated. The author is not addressing the root issue of her lateness but instead covering it up with a lie.\n\nBut there's a practical angle. They both work close, and their routine involves driving together. The author's method ensures they leave on time, which is a practical benefit. However, the solution is a lie, not a communication problem. The right approach might have been to discuss the issue openly, maybe adjust schedules or find a way to manage her time without deception.\n\nThe responses from the subreddit called it controlling and manipulative, which are strong terms. Those reactions suggest that the community sees the action as unethical. While the intention is good, the method is problematic. In relationships, honesty is foundational. Even minor lies can lead to bigger issues if they become a habit.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author is manipulating a situation by deceiving their partner. Even if the outcome is positive (no arguments, on-time departure), the means are dishonest. The wife's autonomy is compromised, and trust could be an issue if found out. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
