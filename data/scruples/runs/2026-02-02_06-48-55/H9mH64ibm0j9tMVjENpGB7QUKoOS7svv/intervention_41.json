We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a person who's been lying to their wife by adjusting her alarm clock. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the problem they're facing is that the wife is often late because she hits the snooze button. The husband wakes up early, and they leave at 7:35. The wife's alarm is set for 6:45, but she snoozes twice, adding 14 minutes (7 each). So her actual wake-up time is 7:00 instead of 6:45. The husband sets her alarm 13 minutes ahead so that when she wakes up, it's actually 7:00, but the alarm shows a later time. Then he resets it back after she's in the shower. The wife believes she only needs 15 minutes to get ready, which is why she's improving her punctuality.\n\nThe husband's defense is that it's a \"little white lie\" that helps their routine. Others in the subreddit called it controlling or manipulative. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nSo, considering the facts: the husband is actively deceiving his wife about the time. He's manipulating the alarm to make her think she has more time than she does. Even if the intention is good (avoiding arguments, helping her be on time), the act of lying and manipulating is there. The wife is being misled about her own habits. \n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. If the wife finds out, even if the intention was kind, she might feel betrayed. The husband isn't communicating the real issue or helping her change her habits through honest methods. Instead, he's using a trick that doesn't address the root problem (snoozing) and might prevent her from developing better time management skills on her own. \n\nAlso, the husband is taking control of her alarm without her knowledge. That's a form of manipulation, even if it's for a perceived good outcome. The fact that others have called it controlling or manipulative supports that. \n\nEven if the outcome is better punctuality, the method is ethically questionable. Lying in relationships can erode trust over time. The husband should have talked to her about the snooze habit and maybe set a non-negotiable time or found another solution that doesn't involve deception.\n\nSo, putting it all together, while the intention might be good, the action of lying and manipulating is wrong. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
