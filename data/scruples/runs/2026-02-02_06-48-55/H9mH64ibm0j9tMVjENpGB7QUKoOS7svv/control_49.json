We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong for lying to his wife. The situation is that he's adjusting her alarm clock to make it seem like she's improving in getting ready faster. He sets her alarm 13 minutes ahead, so she thinks she's using less time than she actually does. He does this so she doesn't get late, and he avoids arguments. But now he's wondering if he's the asshole because some people said it's controlling or manipulative.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are deception and the intent behind it. The husband is lying about the time to make his wife believe she's more efficient than she is. Even though the intention might be good\u2014avoiding arguments and helping her be on time\u2014deception is involved. Trust is a big part of any relationship. If you lie even for what you think is a good reason, it can erode trust over time. The wife could feel manipulated if she found out, which would be hurtful. Also, the husband is taking control of the situation without her consent. Instead of addressing the real issue (like maybe her reliance on snoozing), he's hiding the problem with a lie. That's not solving the underlying issue but covering it up. The fact that people called him controlling or manipulative makes sense because he's altering her reality without her knowing. Even if he's doing it to help, the method is questionable. So, the answer is probably A, yes, he's in the wrong.\n"
