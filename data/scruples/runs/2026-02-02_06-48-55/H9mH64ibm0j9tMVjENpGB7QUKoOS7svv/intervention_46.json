We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for lying to his wife about setting her alarm ahead. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author and his wife drive to work together, and she used to be late. He wakes up early to make coffee. The problem is her snoozing the alarm twice, which adds up to 14 minutes. He sets her alarm 13 minutes ahead to give her enough time, then resets it after she showers. She thinks she's improved at not being late, but actually, he's manipulating the time. He calls it a \"white lie\" and says sometimes lies are good. People on Reddit said it's controlling or manipulative. The user asks if the author is the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intent behind the lie. The author's goal is to help his wife avoid being late, which seems well-meaning. However, the method involves deception. Even if it's for a good cause, lying can have negative consequences. The wife isn't aware of the deception, so she thinks she's improving on her own, which might affect her self-perception or autonomy.\n\nIs it a harmless white lie, or is it manipulative? The line here is tricky. If the lie causes no harm and is for the other person's benefit, some might see it as a kind act. But in a relationship, trust is crucial. Deception, even small, can erode trust. The wife might feel her independence is being undermined if she finds out. She might also feel her efforts to improve aren't genuine if she's being manipulated.\n\nAnother angle: the author is solving a problem he's created. By setting her alarm himself, maybe he should have addressed the root issue, like discussing her difficulty with waking up, rather than manipulating the time. Open communication would be healthier than a white lie. If the wife had known, they might have found a solution together, like adjusting their schedule or finding a better way to manage her time.\n\nAlso, the duration of the lie\u2014eight months\u2014is significant. It's ongoing, not a one-time thing. Prolonged deception can lead to bigger issues. The author's justification is that it's for her benefit, but the wife's autonomy is being compromised. She's making decisions based on false information, which isn't fair.\n\nSo, while the intention is good, the method is deceptive and affects the wife's autonomy. In relationships, honesty is typically valued. Even if the outcome is positive, the means used here might be considered controlling. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
