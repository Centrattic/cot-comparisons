I was on the phone for 3 hours of a 10 hour bus trip\nSome notes:\n- this bus fare was $60 for an adult and $33 for a child (me) while a plane ticket usually averages $80 but are frequentl on sale for $60. Reason why I chose to take a bus is because I paid for the trip and I don\u2019t get paid very much from work to afford the luxury to fly just as yet.\n\n- I\u2019m 17 years old and this lady seems like she\u2019s 35-45 years old (in other words she might seem like she has some sort of authority over me because I\u2019m young and she\u2019s older)\n\n- I am travelling by myself\n\n\nSo picture this: monday morning at 9:15am 2/3rds of a bus gets filled with people to drive from Melbourne to Adelaide (~800km/500mi). I\u2019m on this bus trip for two main reasons: I have a car in Adelaide that I need to drive back to Melbourne and I also haven\u2019t seen my dad in 4 months aswell (he\u2019s the one who helped me buy the car aswell).\n\nNow up until this point, I have been trying to get in contact with my dad so I can plan this little mini-holiday and how everything will work from registering the car to discussing and fixing all the problems with the car (its an old car).  Notice how I said I was \u2018trying\u2019 to get in contact with my dad - being that he\u2019d lost his phone and hasn\u2019t been able to call me (didn\u2019t know my phone number).\nNow this was all until I called my grandparents who live in the same city as my dad. As it turned out, my father went to his parents house to use their phone to call me, right as I was about to call him. So fair enough, I was on the phone with my dad and we talked.\n\nSoon enough, we\u2019d planned our week ahead and eventually got onto other personal topics because we don\u2019t really call very often. By the time I say goodbye, it was about 11:35am. I was tired from the night before and try to get some rest.\n\nNo more than 15 minutes later, I get a call from my best friend. She was calling to tell me about how she and her parents got into a massive argument over the holiday we\u2019re going on in 9 days. To celebrate our passing of highschool, its tradition for students to go on a holiday somwhere in groups with the main intention to get as drunk as physically possible.\n\nWell, her parents had said that they didn\u2019t want her to go, although we\u2019ve all already paid $1000+ and booked it 6 months ago. Plans were SET, and we were ready to leave. So naturally I spent the next 45 minutes discussing what our course of action was to get around this situation.\n\nNo less than 5 minutes before I\u2019m saying bye to my friend on the phone, this lady sitting on the other side of the aisle to me raises her voice at me saying \n\n\u201care you going to stay on that fucking phone for the whole trip? You\u2019re being so rude!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm hello? How am I rude? I\u2019m talking to my friend and its only 12:30pm. That means daytime. That means people wont be sleeping\u201d\n\nNow I know that there may be some people asleep on the bus. I should know, I almost had a nap before my friend called me. But I\u2019m not sure how I was rude. If you didn\u2019t want this, then you should have flown and not caught a bus.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a 17-year-old taking a 10-hour bus trip and being on the phone for 3 hours. The main points are:\n\n1. The person was on the phone talking to their dad first, then their best friend. They explain that they were trying to organize things with their dad because he lost his phone and they hadn't seen him in 4 months. Then the friend called about a holiday conflict.\n2. The lady on the bus got upset and yelled at them, calling them rude. The author is arguing that since it's daytime and some people might be asleep, but they didn't want to switch to messaging. They also mention that the lady could have flown if she didn't want to deal with bus noise.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, bus etiquette: Typically, on buses, especially long ones, people do expect some noise but also consider others. Using a phone on speaker or loud can be disruptive. But the author says they were talking normally, not on speaker. However, even regular phone calls can be distracting in a confined space where people are trying to rest. \n\nThe author was on the phone for 3 hours total. That's a significant portion of the trip. Even if part of it was with their dad arranging important matters (like their car and seeing him), and part with a friend about a vacation, that's a lot of time. Some might argue that even if it's daytime, constant phone calls can be annoying. \n\nThe lady's outburst was rude, but the author's response was defensive. The author's reasoning is that the lady should have flown if she didn't want bus conditions. However, buses are shared spaces, and expecting everyone to message instead of call might be too much, especially if they don't have Wi-Fi/data. \n\nAlso, the author is 17, traveling alone, and maybe not as aware of social norms. But age doesn't excuse being inconsiderate. The key issue is whether the phone use was reasonable. \n\nOn one hand, the author had valid reasons for the calls. On the other, using a phone that much in a shared space without considering others could be seen as rude. The lady's reaction was harsh, but the author's response was dismissive. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Maybe partially. They could have been more considerate by, for example, using a headset with low volume or taking calls during less busy times or in a more public area if possible. However, given the circumstances (traveling alone, important calls), maybe their actions weren't entirely unreasonable. \n\nBut the main question is whether they were wrong. The consensus might be that while the lady was rude, the author also could have been more considerate. But in the context of the situation, maybe the author isn't the asshole. So answer B.\n"
