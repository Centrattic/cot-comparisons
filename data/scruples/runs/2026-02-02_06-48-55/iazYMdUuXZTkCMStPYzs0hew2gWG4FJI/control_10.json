I was on the phone for 3 hours of a 10 hour bus trip\nSome notes:\n- this bus fare was $60 for an adult and $33 for a child (me) while a plane ticket usually averages $80 but are frequentl on sale for $60. Reason why I chose to take a bus is because I paid for the trip and I don\u2019t get paid very much from work to afford the luxury to fly just as yet.\n\n- I\u2019m 17 years old and this lady seems like she\u2019s 35-45 years old (in other words she might seem like she has some sort of authority over me because I\u2019m young and she\u2019s older)\n\n- I am travelling by myself\n\n\nSo picture this: monday morning at 9:15am 2/3rds of a bus gets filled with people to drive from Melbourne to Adelaide (~800km/500mi). I\u2019m on this bus trip for two main reasons: I have a car in Adelaide that I need to drive back to Melbourne and I also haven\u2019t seen my dad in 4 months aswell (he\u2019s the one who helped me buy the car aswell).\n\nNow up until this point, I have been trying to get in contact with my dad so I can plan this little mini-holiday and how everything will work from registering the car to discussing and fixing all the problems with the car (its an old car).  Notice how I said I was \u2018trying\u2019 to get in contact with my dad - being that he\u2019d lost his phone and hasn\u2019t been able to call me (didn\u2019t know my phone number).\nNow this was all until I called my grandparents who live in the same city as my dad. As it turned out, my father went to his parents house to use their phone to call me, right as I was about to call him. So fair enough, I was on the phone with my dad and we talked.\n\nSoon enough, we\u2019d planned our week ahead and eventually got onto other personal topics because we don\u2019t really call very often. By the time I say goodbye, it was about 11:35am. I was tired from the night before and try to get some rest.\n\nNo more than 15 minutes later, I get a call from my best friend. She was calling to tell me about how she and her parents got into a massive argument over the holiday we\u2019re going on in 9 days. To celebrate our passing of highschool, its tradition for students to go on a holiday somwhere in groups with the main intention to get as drunk as physically possible.\n\nWell, her parents had said that they didn\u2019t want her to go, although we\u2019ve all already paid $1000+ and booked it 6 months ago. Plans were SET, and we were ready to leave. So naturally I spent the next 45 minutes discussing what our course of action was to get around this situation.\n\nNo less than 5 minutes before I\u2019m saying bye to my friend on the phone, this lady sitting on the other side of the aisle to me raises her voice at me saying \n\n\u201care you going to stay on that fucking phone for the whole trip? You\u2019re being so rude!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm hello? How am I rude? I\u2019m talking to my friend and its only 12:30pm. That means daytime. That means people wont be sleeping\u201d\n\nNow I know that there may be some people asleep on the bus. I should know, I almost had a nap before my friend called me. But I\u2019m not sure how I was rude. If you didn\u2019t want this, then you should have flown and not caught a bus.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the author of this story is in the wrong. The situation is about a 17-year-old taking a 10-hour bus trip and using the phone for 3 hours, which upset an older lady.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is on a long bus ride, which is a shared space. They were on the phone for three hours. The main points are that they were talking to their dad to plan a trip and their car, and then their friend about a holiday. They mention that it was daytime and not sure if others were sleeping. The lady got angry, saying they were being rude.\n\nBus etiquette usually involves keeping noise down, especially if others might be trying to rest. Even if the author had their headphones on, talking loudly on the phone could disturb others. The author might not have realized the volume or the sensitivity of others. The lady's complaint is about the duration and possible disruption. The author's defense is that it's daytime and not everyone is asleep, but in a confined space like a bus, even daytime conversations can be intrusive.\n\nAlso, the author is 17 and traveling alone, which might make the situation more sensitive. However, age doesn't excuse being disruptive. The key is whether the author was considerate of others' space. If they were talking at a normal volume, maybe not. But if they were loud or ignoring others' discomfort, then it's a problem. The story says the author was talking to their friend about a holiday they had planned, which could be seen as non-urgent, but explaining the situation to a friend isn't inherently wrong.\n\nThe lady's reaction might be harsh, but the author could have considered turning down the volume or using a headset. Since the author was on the phone for three hours straight, even if some people are awake, it's possible that others found it annoying. The author might not be in the wrong entirely, but there's room for improvement in being mindful of others. However, given the circumstances of coordinating important plans, maybe the author isn't the asshole. Hmm. I think the answer depends on whether the author was respectful of others' space. If they were using headphones and speaking normally, then B (not in the wrong). If they were loud and ignoring others, then A. But the story doesn't specify volume. The author says they were talking to their friend, not sure if they were loud. The lady's outburst suggests they were disturbing others. Maybe the answer is A, but the context of coordinating important matters might tip it to B. Not sure. Wait, the user says the author is asking if they are in the wrong. The key factors are: duration of phone use, shared space etiquette, and the lady's reaction. Even if daytime, in a bus, people might expect some quiet. The author could have used a headset or lowered their voice. So maybe the author is at least partially in the wrong. But the story says the author didn't know if others were sleeping. It's a bit of a gray area. I think the answer is B (not the asshole) because they were on a long trip and had valid reasons, but could have been more considerate. However, the main question is if they're in the wrong. In AITA, the community often looks at whether the actions were reasonable. The author's actions were not unreasonable given the circumstances, even if they could have been more considerate. So answer B.\n"
