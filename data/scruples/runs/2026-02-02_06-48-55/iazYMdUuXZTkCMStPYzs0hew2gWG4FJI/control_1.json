I was on the phone for 3 hours of a 10 hour bus trip\nSome notes:\n- this bus fare was $60 for an adult and $33 for a child (me) while a plane ticket usually averages $80 but are frequentl on sale for $60. Reason why I chose to take a bus is because I paid for the trip and I don\u2019t get paid very much from work to afford the luxury to fly just as yet.\n\n- I\u2019m 17 years old and this lady seems like she\u2019s 35-45 years old (in other words she might seem like she has some sort of authority over me because I\u2019m young and she\u2019s older)\n\n- I am travelling by myself\n\n\nSo picture this: monday morning at 9:15am 2/3rds of a bus gets filled with people to drive from Melbourne to Adelaide (~800km/500mi). I\u2019m on this bus trip for two main reasons: I have a car in Adelaide that I need to drive back to Melbourne and I also haven\u2019t seen my dad in 4 months aswell (he\u2019s the one who helped me buy the car aswell).\n\nNow up until this point, I have been trying to get in contact with my dad so I can plan this little mini-holiday and how everything will work from registering the car to discussing and fixing all the problems with the car (its an old car).  Notice how I said I was \u2018trying\u2019 to get in contact with my dad - being that he\u2019d lost his phone and hasn\u2019t been able to call me (didn\u2019t know my phone number).\nNow this was all until I called my grandparents who live in the same city as my dad. As it turned out, my father went to his parents house to use their phone to call me, right as I was about to call him. So fair enough, I was on the phone with my dad and we talked.\n\nSoon enough, we\u2019d planned our week ahead and eventually got onto other personal topics because we don\u2019t really call very often. By the time I say goodbye, it was about 11:35am. I was tired from the night before and try to get some rest.\n\nNo more than 15 minutes later, I get a call from my best friend. She was calling to tell me about how she and her parents got into a massive argument over the holiday we\u2019re going on in 9 days. To celebrate our passing of highschool, its tradition for students to go on a holiday somwhere in groups with the main intention to get as drunk as physically possible.\n\nWell, her parents had said that they didn\u2019t want her to go, although we\u2019ve all already paid $1000+ and booked it 6 months ago. Plans were SET, and we were ready to leave. So naturally I spent the next 45 minutes discussing what our course of action was to get around this situation.\n\nNo less than 5 minutes before I\u2019m saying bye to my friend on the phone, this lady sitting on the other side of the aisle to me raises her voice at me saying \n\n\u201care you going to stay on that fucking phone for the whole trip? You\u2019re being so rude!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm hello? How am I rude? I\u2019m talking to my friend and its only 12:30pm. That means daytime. That means people wont be sleeping\u201d\n\nNow I know that there may be some people asleep on the bus. I should know, I almost had a nap before my friend called me. But I\u2019m not sure how I was rude. If you didn\u2019t want this, then you should have flown and not caught a bus.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is on a 10-hour bus trip and was on the phone for about 3 hours. They were talking to their dad and then their best friend. The lady next to them got upset and told them to stop being rude on the phone. The author is 17, low on money, and traveling alone. They chose the bus because it's cheaper than a plane. The main points they mention are that they were trying to make plans with family, had a valid reason to talk, and that it was daytime, so maybe people aren't expecting quiet.\n\nNow, considering the context. On buses, it's common to have some noise, but loud phone calls can be disruptive. However, the author mentions that they were on the phone during the day, not necessarily disrupting naps. Also, they had important reasons for the calls: family matters and an argument with a friend about a holiday. The lady's complaint was about the entire trip, but the author points out that if she didn't want that, she could have flown. But the author couldn't afford a plane ticket and had to take the bus.\n\nThe age difference: the author is 17, and the lady is older. Maybe the lady perceived the author as being disrespectful because of her age. But the author is traveling alone and needed to make those calls for legitimate reasons. \n\nThe question is whether being on the phone for 3 hours in a public bus is rude. It depends on the environment. Buses can be noisy, and not everyone may be okay with phone calls. But the author wasn't loud, and they were on the phone during the day when people are likely awake. The author also tried to explain that they had valid reasons. The lady's reaction was harsh, calling them rude. \n\nIn this case, the author probably isn't in the wrong because they had a good reason to be on the phone, and it was daytime. However, maybe they could have been more considerate, like using headphones or lowering their voice. But based on the information given, the author's actions don't seem to be in the wrong. The lady's reaction might be over-the-top, especially since the author was handling important matters. So the answer is B.\n"
