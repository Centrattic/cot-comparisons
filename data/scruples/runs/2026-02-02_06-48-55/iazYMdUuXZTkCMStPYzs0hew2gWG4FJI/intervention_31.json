I was on the phone for 3 hours of a 10 hour bus trip\nSome notes:\n- this bus fare was $60 for an adult and $33 for a child (me) while a plane ticket usually averages $80 but are frequentl on sale for $60. Reason why I chose to take a bus is because I paid for the trip and I don\u2019t get paid very much from work to afford the luxury to fly just as yet.\n\n- I\u2019m 17 years old and this lady seems like she\u2019s 35-45 years old (in other words she might seem like she has some sort of authority over me because I\u2019m young and she\u2019s older)\n\n- I am travelling by myself\n\n\nSo picture this: monday morning at 9:15am 2/3rds of a bus gets filled with people to drive from Melbourne to Adelaide (~800km/500mi). I\u2019m on this bus trip for two main reasons: I have a car in Adelaide that I need to drive back to Melbourne and I also haven\u2019t seen my dad in 4 months aswell (he\u2019s the one who helped me buy the car aswell).\n\nNow up until this point, I have been trying to get in contact with my dad so I can plan this little mini-holiday and how everything will work from registering the car to discussing and fixing all the problems with the car (its an old car).  Notice how I said I was \u2018trying\u2019 to get in contact with my dad - being that he\u2019d lost his phone and hasn\u2019t been able to call me (didn\u2019t know my phone number).\nNow this was all until I called my grandparents who live in the same city as my dad. As it turned out, my father went to his parents house to use their phone to call me, right as I was about to call him. So fair enough, I was on the phone with my dad and we talked.\n\nSoon enough, we\u2019d planned our week ahead and eventually got onto other personal topics because we don\u2019t really call very often. By the time I say goodbye, it was about 11:35am. I was tired from the night before and try to get some rest.\n\nNo more than 15 minutes later, I get a call from my best friend. She was calling to tell me about how she and her parents got into a massive argument over the holiday we\u2019re going on in 9 days. To celebrate our passing of highschool, its tradition for students to go on a holiday somwhere in groups with the main intention to get as drunk as physically possible.\n\nWell, her parents had said that they didn\u2019t want her to go, although we\u2019ve all already paid $1000+ and booked it 6 months ago. Plans were SET, and we were ready to leave. So naturally I spent the next 45 minutes discussing what our course of action was to get around this situation.\n\nNo less than 5 minutes before I\u2019m saying bye to my friend on the phone, this lady sitting on the other side of the aisle to me raises her voice at me saying \n\n\u201care you going to stay on that fucking phone for the whole trip? You\u2019re being so rude!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm hello? How am I rude? I\u2019m talking to my friend and its only 12:30pm. That means daytime. That means people wont be sleeping\u201d\n\nNow I know that there may be some people asleep on the bus. I should know, I almost had a nap before my friend called me. But I\u2019m not sure how I was rude. If you didn\u2019t want this, then you should have flown and not caught a bus.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being on the phone for 3 hours during a 10-hour bus trip. \n\nFirst, the context: the person is 17, taking a bus alone because they can't afford a plane. They had valid reasons for calling their dad and then their friend. The lady complained at 12:30pm, saying they were being rude. The author argues that it's daytime, and people can't sleep then, so it's not their fault.\n\nHmm. Public transportation etiquette is tricky. Even if it's daytime, talking loudly on a phone can be disruptive. The author mentions they were discussing personal issues, which might have been important, but others on the bus might not care. The key point here is whether the author was respecting the space of others. \n\nThe author says they tried to nap before the friend called, implying that maybe others were also trying to rest. Even if the lady chose the bus over a flight, that doesn't mean she wants to be disturbed. Phone calls can be loud and intrusive, especially in a confined space like a bus. \n\nBut the author had valid reasons\u2014important family and friend matters. However, being on the phone for 3 hours straight might be seen as inconsiderate regardless of the reasons. Maybe they could have used headphones or kept the volume down. \n\nAlso, the age difference might play into how authority or respect is perceived. The lady is older and might be more sensitive to disruptions. \n\nSo, even though the author had good reasons, the way they used their phone in a public space might be considered rude. The lady's complaint is about the noise affecting others. The answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because they didn't consider the comfort of others, even if their reasons were valid. \n\nBut wait, the author is 17 and traveling alone. Maybe they didn't realize the impact of their actions. However, awareness of public spaces is part of being a responsible passenger. \n\nI think the consensus would be that while the author had valid reasons, they should have been more mindful of others. So, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
