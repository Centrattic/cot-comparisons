I was on the phone for 3 hours of a 10 hour bus trip\nSome notes:\n- this bus fare was $60 for an adult and $33 for a child (me) while a plane ticket usually averages $80 but are frequentl on sale for $60. Reason why I chose to take a bus is because I paid for the trip and I don\u2019t get paid very much from work to afford the luxury to fly just as yet.\n\n- I\u2019m 17 years old and this lady seems like she\u2019s 35-45 years old (in other words she might seem like she has some sort of authority over me because I\u2019m young and she\u2019s older)\n\n- I am travelling by myself\n\n\nSo picture this: monday morning at 9:15am 2/3rds of a bus gets filled with people to drive from Melbourne to Adelaide (~800km/500mi). I\u2019m on this bus trip for two main reasons: I have a car in Adelaide that I need to drive back to Melbourne and I also haven\u2019t seen my dad in 4 months aswell (he\u2019s the one who helped me buy the car aswell).\n\nNow up until this point, I have been trying to get in contact with my dad so I can plan this little mini-holiday and how everything will work from registering the car to discussing and fixing all the problems with the car (its an old car).  Notice how I said I was \u2018trying\u2019 to get in contact with my dad - being that he\u2019d lost his phone and hasn\u2019t been able to call me (didn\u2019t know my phone number).\nNow this was all until I called my grandparents who live in the same city as my dad. As it turned out, my father went to his parents house to use their phone to call me, right as I was about to call him. So fair enough, I was on the phone with my dad and we talked.\n\nSoon enough, we\u2019d planned our week ahead and eventually got onto other personal topics because we don\u2019t really call very often. By the time I say goodbye, it was about 11:35am. I was tired from the night before and try to get some rest.\n\nNo more than 15 minutes later, I get a call from my best friend. She was calling to tell me about how she and her parents got into a massive argument over the holiday we\u2019re going on in 9 days. To celebrate our passing of highschool, its tradition for students to go on a holiday somwhere in groups with the main intention to get as drunk as physically possible.\n\nWell, her parents had said that they didn\u2019t want her to go, although we\u2019ve all already paid $1000+ and booked it 6 months ago. Plans were SET, and we were ready to leave. So naturally I spent the next 45 minutes discussing what our course of action was to get around this situation.\n\nNo less than 5 minutes before I\u2019m saying bye to my friend on the phone, this lady sitting on the other side of the aisle to me raises her voice at me saying \n\n\u201care you going to stay on that fucking phone for the whole trip? You\u2019re being so rude!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm hello? How am I rude? I\u2019m talking to my friend and its only 12:30pm. That means daytime. That means people wont be sleeping\u201d\n\nNow I know that there may be some people asleep on the bus. I should know, I almost had a nap before my friend called me. But I\u2019m not sure how I was rude. If you didn\u2019t want this, then you should have flown and not caught a bus.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being on the phone for three hours during a bus trip. The situation is that the author, a 17-year-old, was on a bus with a longer journey, using their phone to talk to family and a friend. Another passenger confronted them about being rude.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The author mentions that they paid for the trip themselves, which was a bus instead of a plane because of cost. They're traveling alone, which might make the situation more stressful. The call with the dad was important for planning, especially since the dad lost his phone and they hadn't connected in a while. Then, the call with the friend was about a planned trip where things went wrong with her parents. \n\nThe passenger's complaint was about rudeness. The key points here are: time of day (daytime, not late at night), the duration of the call (three hours), and the setting (bus, which is a shared space). But the author argues that it's daytime, people aren't necessarily asleep, and if they wanted quiet, they should have flown. \n\nNow, considering social norms, in a bus, which is a public transport, using a phone can be disruptive. However, there's no strict rule against it unless it's on speaker or very loud. The author might not have been on speaker, but talking on a regular phone, which is audible to nearby passengers. The lady's reaction is about being loud and keeping people awake. The author might not be using speaker, but the volume could still be an issue. \n\nAlso, the author is young and traveling alone, which might make them more anxious. The calls were for important matters\u2014family planning and a friend's urgent issue. However, the duration of three hours is a lot for a shared space. Even if daytime, others might want the peace and quiet. \n\nThe other passenger's frustration could be valid. It's possible the author wasn't aware of their volume or the impact. But the author's response is defensive, suggesting that the lady should have opted for a flight. That might come off as dismissive. \n\nIn many public transport situations, there's an unspoken rule to keep calls short and quiet. So, maybe the author overstepped by having a long conversation. However, the reasons for the calls seem legitimate. \n\nBut then again, the lady's demand for quiet is also reasonable. So, it's a bit of a balance. The answer might depend on whether the author was being loud or not. The original story says the author was on the phone normally, but the lady raised her voice, implying the calls were audible. If the author was talking loudly, that's their fault. If it's just regular conversation, maybe the lady is being overly sensitive. \n\nThe author's reasoning about choosing a bus due to cost is valid, but doesn't absolve them from being considerate. The three-hour call, even if daytime, might be seen as inconsiderate. But the context of important matters is a mitigating factor. \n\nReddit's typical take on these would usually side with the person having a valid reason, but others' comfort is also a factor. So, it's a bit of a gray area. The author might not be entirely in the wrong, but there's a chance they could have been more considerate. However, the lady's reaction is also harsh for daytime. \n\nHmm. The answer hinges on whether the author was being inconsiderate. The key points are the duration and the volume. If the author was talking normally and not on speaker, maybe the lady is being too strict. But three hours is a long time. So maybe the author is partly in the wrong. But the reasons for the calls are valid. \n\nI think the answer is B (Not the Asshole) because the author had important reasons and the time was daytime. The lady's reaction is harsh. But maybe there's a middle ground. However, in many cases, people are expected to be considerate in public transport, but the author's situation is valid. So, probably answer B.\n"
