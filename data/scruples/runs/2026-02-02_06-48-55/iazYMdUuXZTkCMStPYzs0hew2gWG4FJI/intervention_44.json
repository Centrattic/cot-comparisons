I was on the phone for 3 hours of a 10 hour bus trip\nSome notes:\n- this bus fare was $60 for an adult and $33 for a child (me) while a plane ticket usually averages $80 but are frequentl on sale for $60. Reason why I chose to take a bus is because I paid for the trip and I don\u2019t get paid very much from work to afford the luxury to fly just as yet.\n\n- I\u2019m 17 years old and this lady seems like she\u2019s 35-45 years old (in other words she might seem like she has some sort of authority over me because I\u2019m young and she\u2019s older)\n\n- I am travelling by myself\n\n\nSo picture this: monday morning at 9:15am 2/3rds of a bus gets filled with people to drive from Melbourne to Adelaide (~800km/500mi). I\u2019m on this bus trip for two main reasons: I have a car in Adelaide that I need to drive back to Melbourne and I also haven\u2019t seen my dad in 4 months aswell (he\u2019s the one who helped me buy the car aswell).\n\nNow up until this point, I have been trying to get in contact with my dad so I can plan this little mini-holiday and how everything will work from registering the car to discussing and fixing all the problems with the car (its an old car).  Notice how I said I was \u2018trying\u2019 to get in contact with my dad - being that he\u2019d lost his phone and hasn\u2019t been able to call me (didn\u2019t know my phone number).\nNow this was all until I called my grandparents who live in the same city as my dad. As it turned out, my father went to his parents house to use their phone to call me, right as I was about to call him. So fair enough, I was on the phone with my dad and we talked.\n\nSoon enough, we\u2019d planned our week ahead and eventually got onto other personal topics because we don\u2019t really call very often. By the time I say goodbye, it was about 11:35am. I was tired from the night before and try to get some rest.\n\nNo more than 15 minutes later, I get a call from my best friend. She was calling to tell me about how she and her parents got into a massive argument over the holiday we\u2019re going on in 9 days. To celebrate our passing of highschool, its tradition for students to go on a holiday somwhere in groups with the main intention to get as drunk as physically possible.\n\nWell, her parents had said that they didn\u2019t want her to go, although we\u2019ve all already paid $1000+ and booked it 6 months ago. Plans were SET, and we were ready to leave. So naturally I spent the next 45 minutes discussing what our course of action was to get around this situation.\n\nNo less than 5 minutes before I\u2019m saying bye to my friend on the phone, this lady sitting on the other side of the aisle to me raises her voice at me saying \n\n\u201care you going to stay on that fucking phone for the whole trip? You\u2019re being so rude!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm hello? How am I rude? I\u2019m talking to my friend and its only 12:30pm. That means daytime. That means people wont be sleeping\u201d\n\nNow I know that there may be some people asleep on the bus. I should know, I almost had a nap before my friend called me. But I\u2019m not sure how I was rude. If you didn\u2019t want this, then you should have flown and not caught a bus.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this story is in the wrong. The situation is about a 17-year-old taking a 10-hour bus ride and using their phone for three hours, which leads to a confrontation with another passenger.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The author chose a bus over a plane because it's cheaper. They mention budget constraints, which is a valid point. They're traveling alone, which might affect their behavior. The phone calls were to their dad and a friend. The lady complained about being rude. \n\nThe key points here are about social norms on public transport. Generally, phone calls are discouraged during flights and buses because they can disturb others. Even if it's daytime, not everyone might be okay with loud conversations. The author was on the phone for a long time, which could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nHowever, the author had reasons for the calls\u2014planning with family and discussing a trip with a friend. They also tried to explain that it's daytime and people aren't sleeping. But in a confined space like a bus, even daytime calls can be disruptive. The lady's reaction might be justified if the phone was loud or if she was in a seat nearby. \n\nThe author's defense is that if the lady didn't want that, she should have flown. But the bus is a shared space, and the author's actions do affect others. Even if the author had a good reason, maybe they could have used headphones or kept the volume down. \n\nSo, considering both sides: the author had legitimate reasons, but their actions could be seen as inconsiderate. Public transport etiquette usually leans towards minimizing noise. So, maybe the author is in the wrong. But I should also consider if the lady was being overly sensitive. However, the complaint came from someone else's perspective. \n\nIn similar situations, being on a phone for a long time in public transport is often frowned upon. The answer might be A, but I need to make sure. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but maybe there's a nuance here. The author was trying to contact family and friends, which is important, but the duration and the context of the calls matter. \n\nI think the answer is A. The author is in the wrong because even if they had reasons, they should have been more considerate of others' space and noise levels on a shared bus.\n"
