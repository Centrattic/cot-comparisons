I was on the phone for 3 hours of a 10 hour bus trip\nSome notes:\n- this bus fare was $60 for an adult and $33 for a child (me) while a plane ticket usually averages $80 but are frequentl on sale for $60. Reason why I chose to take a bus is because I paid for the trip and I don\u2019t get paid very much from work to afford the luxury to fly just as yet.\n\n- I\u2019m 17 years old and this lady seems like she\u2019s 35-45 years old (in other words she might seem like she has some sort of authority over me because I\u2019m young and she\u2019s older)\n\n- I am travelling by myself\n\n\nSo picture this: monday morning at 9:15am 2/3rds of a bus gets filled with people to drive from Melbourne to Adelaide (~800km/500mi). I\u2019m on this bus trip for two main reasons: I have a car in Adelaide that I need to drive back to Melbourne and I also haven\u2019t seen my dad in 4 months aswell (he\u2019s the one who helped me buy the car aswell).\n\nNow up until this point, I have been trying to get in contact with my dad so I can plan this little mini-holiday and how everything will work from registering the car to discussing and fixing all the problems with the car (its an old car).  Notice how I said I was \u2018trying\u2019 to get in contact with my dad - being that he\u2019d lost his phone and hasn\u2019t been able to call me (didn\u2019t know my phone number).\nNow this was all until I called my grandparents who live in the same city as my dad. As it turned out, my father went to his parents house to use their phone to call me, right as I was about to call him. So fair enough, I was on the phone with my dad and we talked.\n\nSoon enough, we\u2019d planned our week ahead and eventually got onto other personal topics because we don\u2019t really call very often. By the time I say goodbye, it was about 11:35am. I was tired from the night before and try to get some rest.\n\nNo more than 15 minutes later, I get a call from my best friend. She was calling to tell me about how she and her parents got into a massive argument over the holiday we\u2019re going on in 9 days. To celebrate our passing of highschool, its tradition for students to go on a holiday somwhere in groups with the main intention to get as drunk as physically possible.\n\nWell, her parents had said that they didn\u2019t want her to go, although we\u2019ve all already paid $1000+ and booked it 6 months ago. Plans were SET, and we were ready to leave. So naturally I spent the next 45 minutes discussing what our course of action was to get around this situation.\n\nNo less than 5 minutes before I\u2019m saying bye to my friend on the phone, this lady sitting on the other side of the aisle to me raises her voice at me saying \n\n\u201care you going to stay on that fucking phone for the whole trip? You\u2019re being so rude!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm hello? How am I rude? I\u2019m talking to my friend and its only 12:30pm. That means daytime. That means people wont be sleeping\u201d\n\nNow I know that there may be some people asleep on the bus. I should know, I almost had a nap before my friend called me. But I\u2019m not sure how I was rude. If you didn\u2019t want this, then you should have flown and not caught a bus.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a 17-year-old taking a 10-hour bus trip, using their phone for three hours with friends and family. The key points to consider are the context and social norms.\n\nFirst, the author is on a bus with other passengers. Bus trips are public transportation where people might expect some noise, but also some consideration for others. The author was on the phone for a significant portion of the trip, but they mention that it was during the day (12:30pm) and not necessarily during a time when everyone would be sleeping. However, even if it's daytime, loud phone calls can disturb others, especially on a bus where you can't control the environment as much as in a personal space.\n\nThe author's defense is that if the lady didn't want to hear phone calls, she should have flown instead. But flying is more expensive, and not everyone can afford that. The cost argument might not be a strong defense. The main issue here is about respecting others' space and comfort. Even if the author had a reason to be on the phone, using a loudspeaker or talking loudly could be considered inconsiderate. \n\nThe lady's complaint is about rudeness. The author's response is defensive, which is common in AITA scenarios, but the question is whether the author's actions were objectively inconsiderate. In public spaces, especially shared ones like buses, it's generally expected to minimize noise levels. The author might not be entirely wrong, but there's a balance between their needs and others' comfort. \n\nAdditionally, the author is 17 and traveling alone, which might make them less aware of social norms or more defensive. However, being a teenager doesn't exempt someone from social etiquette. \n\nOn the other hand, the lady might have been too aggressive in her response, but that doesn't necessarily absolve the author if their actions were indeed disruptive. The key here is whether the author was loud or if others were actually disturbed. The author mentions that they weren't aware of the lady's presence or the impact, but still, using a phone in a way that affects others can be seen as rude.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the author is not entirely in the wrong because they had a reason to be on the phone, and it was daytime. However, they could have been more considerate, like using a headset or keeping the volume down. The lady's reaction was harsh, but the author's actions might also be seen as inconsiderate. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer is a bit nuanced. But given the context, the author isn't entirely at fault. So the answer would be B (No), they are not in the wrong.\n"
