I was on the phone for 3 hours of a 10 hour bus trip\nSome notes:\n- this bus fare was $60 for an adult and $33 for a child (me) while a plane ticket usually averages $80 but are frequentl on sale for $60. Reason why I chose to take a bus is because I paid for the trip and I don\u2019t get paid very much from work to afford the luxury to fly just as yet.\n\n- I\u2019m 17 years old and this lady seems like she\u2019s 35-45 years old (in other words she might seem like she has some sort of authority over me because I\u2019m young and she\u2019s older)\n\n- I am travelling by myself\n\n\nSo picture this: monday morning at 9:15am 2/3rds of a bus gets filled with people to drive from Melbourne to Adelaide (~800km/500mi). I\u2019m on this bus trip for two main reasons: I have a car in Adelaide that I need to drive back to Melbourne and I also haven\u2019t seen my dad in 4 months aswell (he\u2019s the one who helped me buy the car aswell).\n\nNow up until this point, I have been trying to get in contact with my dad so I can plan this little mini-holiday and how everything will work from registering the car to discussing and fixing all the problems with the car (its an old car).  Notice how I said I was \u2018trying\u2019 to get in contact with my dad - being that he\u2019d lost his phone and hasn\u2019t been able to call me (didn\u2019t know my phone number).\nNow this was all until I called my grandparents who live in the same city as my dad. As it turned out, my father went to his parents house to use their phone to call me, right as I was about to call him. So fair enough, I was on the phone with my dad and we talked.\n\nSoon enough, we\u2019d planned our week ahead and eventually got onto other personal topics because we don\u2019t really call very often. By the time I say goodbye, it was about 11:35am. I was tired from the night before and try to get some rest.\n\nNo more than 15 minutes later, I get a call from my best friend. She was calling to tell me about how she and her parents got into a massive argument over the holiday we\u2019re going on in 9 days. To celebrate our passing of highschool, its tradition for students to go on a holiday somwhere in groups with the main intention to get as drunk as physically possible.\n\nWell, her parents had said that they didn\u2019t want her to go, although we\u2019ve all already paid $1000+ and booked it 6 months ago. Plans were SET, and we were ready to leave. So naturally I spent the next 45 minutes discussing what our course of action was to get around this situation.\n\nNo less than 5 minutes before I\u2019m saying bye to my friend on the phone, this lady sitting on the other side of the aisle to me raises her voice at me saying \n\n\u201care you going to stay on that fucking phone for the whole trip? You\u2019re being so rude!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm hello? How am I rude? I\u2019m talking to my friend and its only 12:30pm. That means daytime. That means people wont be sleeping\u201d\n\nNow I know that there may be some people asleep on the bus. I should know, I almost had a nap before my friend called me. But I\u2019m not sure how I was rude. If you didn\u2019t want this, then you should have flown and not caught a bus.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down the situation here. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The key points are that the author was on the phone for 3 hours out of a 10-hour bus trip, which led to a confrontation with another passenger. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is 17, traveling alone, and had a valid reason to be on the phone\u2014discussing important matters with family and friends. They mention that they tried to nap before the call and that it was daytime, so maybe people weren't expecting noise. However, the other passenger felt it was rude.\n\nNow, in shared spaces like buses, there are social norms about keeping noise levels down, especially if others might be trying to rest. Even if it's daytime, not everyone might be up and about. The author might not have considered that their phone conversation could be disturbing others, even if they themselves were on a short call. \n\nOn the other hand, the author had important reasons for the calls\u2014planning with family and discussing a trip with a friend. They also paid for the bus ticket themselves, which shows they're making an effort with limited funds. The friend's argument with her parents adds urgency to the conversation. \n\nBut the issue here isn't just the conversation itself. It's about volume and awareness of the surroundings. If the author was speaking loudly or didn't use headphones for music, that's different. However, regular phone calls can be disruptive in quiet environments. The other passenger's outburst suggests that the noise level was indeed a problem. \n\nThe author might not have been inconsiderate, but they might have overlooked the shared space aspect. Maybe using a headset or moving to a less crowded area for the call could have been better. However, the length of the call (3 hours) is significant. Even if there's a good reason, that's a long time on a bus. \n\nSo, while the author had valid reasons, the duration and possible loudness of the call could be seen as inconsiderate. The other passenger's reaction is understandable if the noise was disruptive. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not considering others' comfort, even if they had good intentions. But it's a bit of a judgment call. Alternatively, if the author didn't realize they were being loud, maybe they aren't the only one at fault. \n\nIn conclusion, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because they should have been more mindful of others' space and noise levels, even with good reasons for the calls.\n"
