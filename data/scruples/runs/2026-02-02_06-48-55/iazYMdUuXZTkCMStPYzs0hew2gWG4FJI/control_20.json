I was on the phone for 3 hours of a 10 hour bus trip\nSome notes:\n- this bus fare was $60 for an adult and $33 for a child (me) while a plane ticket usually averages $80 but are frequentl on sale for $60. Reason why I chose to take a bus is because I paid for the trip and I don\u2019t get paid very much from work to afford the luxury to fly just as yet.\n\n- I\u2019m 17 years old and this lady seems like she\u2019s 35-45 years old (in other words she might seem like she has some sort of authority over me because I\u2019m young and she\u2019s older)\n\n- I am travelling by myself\n\n\nSo picture this: monday morning at 9:15am 2/3rds of a bus gets filled with people to drive from Melbourne to Adelaide (~800km/500mi). I\u2019m on this bus trip for two main reasons: I have a car in Adelaide that I need to drive back to Melbourne and I also haven\u2019t seen my dad in 4 months aswell (he\u2019s the one who helped me buy the car aswell).\n\nNow up until this point, I have been trying to get in contact with my dad so I can plan this little mini-holiday and how everything will work from registering the car to discussing and fixing all the problems with the car (its an old car).  Notice how I said I was \u2018trying\u2019 to get in contact with my dad - being that he\u2019d lost his phone and hasn\u2019t been able to call me (didn\u2019t know my phone number).\nNow this was all until I called my grandparents who live in the same city as my dad. As it turned out, my father went to his parents house to use their phone to call me, right as I was about to call him. So fair enough, I was on the phone with my dad and we talked.\n\nSoon enough, we\u2019d planned our week ahead and eventually got onto other personal topics because we don\u2019t really call very often. By the time I say goodbye, it was about 11:35am. I was tired from the night before and try to get some rest.\n\nNo more than 15 minutes later, I get a call from my best friend. She was calling to tell me about how she and her parents got into a massive argument over the holiday we\u2019re going on in 9 days. To celebrate our passing of highschool, its tradition for students to go on a holiday somwhere in groups with the main intention to get as drunk as physically possible.\n\nWell, her parents had said that they didn\u2019t want her to go, although we\u2019ve all already paid $1000+ and booked it 6 months ago. Plans were SET, and we were ready to leave. So naturally I spent the next 45 minutes discussing what our course of action was to get around this situation.\n\nNo less than 5 minutes before I\u2019m saying bye to my friend on the phone, this lady sitting on the other side of the aisle to me raises her voice at me saying \n\n\u201care you going to stay on that fucking phone for the whole trip? You\u2019re being so rude!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm hello? How am I rude? I\u2019m talking to my friend and its only 12:30pm. That means daytime. That means people wont be sleeping\u201d\n\nNow I know that there may be some people asleep on the bus. I should know, I almost had a nap before my friend called me. But I\u2019m not sure how I was rude. If you didn\u2019t want this, then you should have flown and not caught a bus.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a 17-year-old who was on the phone for a long time on a bus. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the bus trip is 10 hours long, and the person was on the phone for 3 hours. They explain that they were trying to contact their dad, then spoke with their best friend about a holiday issue. The key points are the duration and the context of the calls. \n\nThe person mentions they paid for the trip themselves, which was $33 for a child. They also note that they're young and traveling alone. The lady complained about them being rude. The question is whether the author was wrong.\n\nSo, is talking on the phone for 3 hours on a bus considered rude? Well, bus etiquette usually depends on the environment. If the bus is noisy, maybe it's okay, but if people are trying to rest, even during the day, loud conversations could be disruptive. The author was talking on the phone, which can be louder than someone listening to music with headphones. \n\nHowever, the author was in the middle of important discussions\u2014first with their dad about car logistics and family matters, then with a friend about a planned trip. They also mention that they were on the phone during the day when it's less likely people are sleeping. The lady's complaint might be valid if the conversation was loud and disturbing, but the author might not be at fault for necessary communication. \n\nThere's also the context of age. The author is 17 and traveling alone, which might make the situation more sensitive. The lady might perceive the younger person as less experienced, but that doesn't necessarily mean the author is wrong. \n\nBus companies often have rules about phone use to prevent disturbance. If the author was on the phone in a way that's disruptive, even during the day, they could be at fault. But if they were in a public area and not in a specific quiet zone, it might be acceptable. The author's response to the lady's comment was defensive, which could indicate they felt their actions were justified.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the author might not be entirely wrong because they were handling important matters. However, if their phone calls were loud and disturbing others, then they might have been disrespectful. The answer depends on whether the volume and manner of their calls were disruptive, which isn't clearly detailed. But given the explanation, the author's actions seem reasonable under the circumstances.\n"
