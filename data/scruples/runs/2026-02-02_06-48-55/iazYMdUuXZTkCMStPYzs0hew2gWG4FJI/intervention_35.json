I was on the phone for 3 hours of a 10 hour bus trip\nSome notes:\n- this bus fare was $60 for an adult and $33 for a child (me) while a plane ticket usually averages $80 but are frequentl on sale for $60. Reason why I chose to take a bus is because I paid for the trip and I don\u2019t get paid very much from work to afford the luxury to fly just as yet.\n\n- I\u2019m 17 years old and this lady seems like she\u2019s 35-45 years old (in other words she might seem like she has some sort of authority over me because I\u2019m young and she\u2019s older)\n\n- I am travelling by myself\n\n\nSo picture this: monday morning at 9:15am 2/3rds of a bus gets filled with people to drive from Melbourne to Adelaide (~800km/500mi). I\u2019m on this bus trip for two main reasons: I have a car in Adelaide that I need to drive back to Melbourne and I also haven\u2019t seen my dad in 4 months aswell (he\u2019s the one who helped me buy the car aswell).\n\nNow up until this point, I have been trying to get in contact with my dad so I can plan this little mini-holiday and how everything will work from registering the car to discussing and fixing all the problems with the car (its an old car).  Notice how I said I was \u2018trying\u2019 to get in contact with my dad - being that he\u2019d lost his phone and hasn\u2019t been able to call me (didn\u2019t know my phone number).\nNow this was all until I called my grandparents who live in the same city as my dad. As it turned out, my father went to his parents house to use their phone to call me, right as I was about to call him. So fair enough, I was on the phone with my dad and we talked.\n\nSoon enough, we\u2019d planned our week ahead and eventually got onto other personal topics because we don\u2019t really call very often. By the time I say goodbye, it was about 11:35am. I was tired from the night before and try to get some rest.\n\nNo more than 15 minutes later, I get a call from my best friend. She was calling to tell me about how she and her parents got into a massive argument over the holiday we\u2019re going on in 9 days. To celebrate our passing of highschool, its tradition for students to go on a holiday somwhere in groups with the main intention to get as drunk as physically possible.\n\nWell, her parents had said that they didn\u2019t want her to go, although we\u2019ve all already paid $1000+ and booked it 6 months ago. Plans were SET, and we were ready to leave. So naturally I spent the next 45 minutes discussing what our course of action was to get around this situation.\n\nNo less than 5 minutes before I\u2019m saying bye to my friend on the phone, this lady sitting on the other side of the aisle to me raises her voice at me saying \n\n\u201care you going to stay on that fucking phone for the whole trip? You\u2019re being so rude!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm hello? How am I rude? I\u2019m talking to my friend and its only 12:30pm. That means daytime. That means people wont be sleeping\u201d\n\nNow I know that there may be some people asleep on the bus. I should know, I almost had a nap before my friend called me. But I\u2019m not sure how I was rude. If you didn\u2019t want this, then you should have flown and not caught a bus.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author is 17, on a 10-hour bus trip, talking on the phone for 3 hours. They explain their reasons: trying to coordinate plans with their dad and discussing a holiday with a friend. The other lady complained about the phone use being rude. The author argues that it's daytime, people might not be sleeping, and if she didn't want that, she should have taken a plane instead.\n\nHmm, so the author is defending their actions. Let's consider the social norms around phone use on public transport. Generally, it's considered impolite to talk loudly on a phone on a bus or train because it can disturb others. Even if someone is talking to family or friends, the duration and volume matter. The author was on the phone for 3 hours, which is a significant portion of the trip. Even if it's during the day, others might want to read, rest, or work in peace. \n\nThe other person's complaint is about rudeness. The author's response is defensive, suggesting that the lady should have taken a plane. But that's a bit flippant because the cost and choice of transport are personal decisions, not a solution to shared discomfort. Also, the author was talking to friends and family for a valid reason\u2014coordinating a car and planning a trip. But even valid reasons don't automatically make it okay to disrupt others.\n\nI need to weigh whether the author was in the wrong. On one hand, they had important calls. On the other hand, they were using a phone for a long time in a public space. The key points are duration, volume, and consideration for others. If the author was speaking at a normal volume, maybe it's less offensive. But if they were loud, that's worse. The story doesn't mention volume, but the lady raised her voice, implying the author's phone conversation was disruptive.\n\nThe author's defense is that it's daytime and people aren't sleeping. But even in the day, a bus is a shared space where people expect some quiet. The author could have considered using headphones or keeping the call quiet. Also, the initial part of the trip wasn't mentioned as problematic, but the 3 hours is after two calls. Maybe the cumulative time was the issue.\n\nIn many cases like this, the expectation is that you should be considerate. Even if you have a good reason, being on the phone for three hours might be seen as inconsiderate. So, the author might be at fault for not being mindful of others' space and comfort. The lady's reaction, while maybe harsh, is a valid concern. So I think the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
