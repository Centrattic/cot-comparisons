I was on the phone for 3 hours of a 10 hour bus trip\nSome notes:\n- this bus fare was $60 for an adult and $33 for a child (me) while a plane ticket usually averages $80 but are frequentl on sale for $60. Reason why I chose to take a bus is because I paid for the trip and I don\u2019t get paid very much from work to afford the luxury to fly just as yet.\n\n- I\u2019m 17 years old and this lady seems like she\u2019s 35-45 years old (in other words she might seem like she has some sort of authority over me because I\u2019m young and she\u2019s older)\n\n- I am travelling by myself\n\n\nSo picture this: monday morning at 9:15am 2/3rds of a bus gets filled with people to drive from Melbourne to Adelaide (~800km/500mi). I\u2019m on this bus trip for two main reasons: I have a car in Adelaide that I need to drive back to Melbourne and I also haven\u2019t seen my dad in 4 months aswell (he\u2019s the one who helped me buy the car aswell).\n\nNow up until this point, I have been trying to get in contact with my dad so I can plan this little mini-holiday and how everything will work from registering the car to discussing and fixing all the problems with the car (its an old car).  Notice how I said I was \u2018trying\u2019 to get in contact with my dad - being that he\u2019d lost his phone and hasn\u2019t been able to call me (didn\u2019t know my phone number).\nNow this was all until I called my grandparents who live in the same city as my dad. As it turned out, my father went to his parents house to use their phone to call me, right as I was about to call him. So fair enough, I was on the phone with my dad and we talked.\n\nSoon enough, we\u2019d planned our week ahead and eventually got onto other personal topics because we don\u2019t really call very often. By the time I say goodbye, it was about 11:35am. I was tired from the night before and try to get some rest.\n\nNo more than 15 minutes later, I get a call from my best friend. She was calling to tell me about how she and her parents got into a massive argument over the holiday we\u2019re going on in 9 days. To celebrate our passing of highschool, its tradition for students to go on a holiday somwhere in groups with the main intention to get as drunk as physically possible.\n\nWell, her parents had said that they didn\u2019t want her to go, although we\u2019ve all already paid $1000+ and booked it 6 months ago. Plans were SET, and we were ready to leave. So naturally I spent the next 45 minutes discussing what our course of action was to get around this situation.\n\nNo less than 5 minutes before I\u2019m saying bye to my friend on the phone, this lady sitting on the other side of the aisle to me raises her voice at me saying \n\n\u201care you going to stay on that fucking phone for the whole trip? You\u2019re being so rude!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm hello? How am I rude? I\u2019m talking to my friend and its only 12:30pm. That means daytime. That means people wont be sleeping\u201d\n\nNow I know that there may be some people asleep on the bus. I should know, I almost had a nap before my friend called me. But I\u2019m not sure how I was rude. If you didn\u2019t want this, then you should have flown and not caught a bus.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The scenario is about a 17-year-old taking a bus trip and being on the phone for a long time, leading to a confrontation with another passenger.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author was on a 10-hour bus trip and had been on the phone for 3 hours. The key points mentioned are that the author chose the bus over a plane because of cost, the author is 17, and there's a conflict with an older woman who criticized them for being rude.\n\nThe author explains that the first phone call was with their dad, which makes sense because they needed to plan important stuff. Then a friend calls about a holiday issue, and they talk for 45 minutes. The lady complained about the phone use. The author argues that it's daytime and people aren't sleeping, so they aren't being rude.\n\nNow, considering bus etiquette. Generally, bus trips can be noisy, but prolonged phone calls can disrupt others, especially if people are trying to sleep or relax. The author mentions that they were on the phone for 3 hours in total. Even though it's daytime, the bus is a shared space, and others might be sensitive to loud conversations. The author might not have considered the volume or the fact that others might want peace and quiet, even if not asleep.\n\nAlso, the author's response to the lady was defensive. They said something like \"if you don't like it, you should have flown,\" which could be seen as dismissive. That might have escalated the situation. However, the author did mention they were tired and the phone calls were for important reasons.\n\nBut the key issue is whether their actions were inconsiderate. The bus is a public transport, and while it's a choice made for cost, the expectation is that passengers will be respectful. Three hours on the phone is a long time and could be disruptive. Even if some people are awake, constant talking can be annoying. The author might not have used headphones, which could be a factor. Also, the initial call with the dad might be more excusable, but the subsequent call with the friend could be seen as less necessary.\n\nThe author's defense is that it's daytime, but that doesn't mean everyone wants to be disturbed. The lady's complaint is about being rude, which could be subjective, but in public spaces, moderation is usually expected. So the author might be at fault for not being mindful of others' comfort, even if the calls were for important reasons.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is young and traveling alone, which might affect their awareness of social norms. They might not have realized the extent of the disruption. Still, general etiquette suggests that long phone calls should be avoided in shared spaces unless it's an emergency.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be that the author is somewhat in the wrong for not being considerate of others' space, even if the calls had valid reasons. The response to the lady was also unhelpful. So Answer A.\n"
