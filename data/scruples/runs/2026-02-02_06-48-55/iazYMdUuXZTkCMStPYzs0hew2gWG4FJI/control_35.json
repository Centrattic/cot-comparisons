I was on the phone for 3 hours of a 10 hour bus trip\nSome notes:\n- this bus fare was $60 for an adult and $33 for a child (me) while a plane ticket usually averages $80 but are frequentl on sale for $60. Reason why I chose to take a bus is because I paid for the trip and I don\u2019t get paid very much from work to afford the luxury to fly just as yet.\n\n- I\u2019m 17 years old and this lady seems like she\u2019s 35-45 years old (in other words she might seem like she has some sort of authority over me because I\u2019m young and she\u2019s older)\n\n- I am travelling by myself\n\n\nSo picture this: monday morning at 9:15am 2/3rds of a bus gets filled with people to drive from Melbourne to Adelaide (~800km/500mi). I\u2019m on this bus trip for two main reasons: I have a car in Adelaide that I need to drive back to Melbourne and I also haven\u2019t seen my dad in 4 months aswell (he\u2019s the one who helped me buy the car aswell).\n\nNow up until this point, I have been trying to get in contact with my dad so I can plan this little mini-holiday and how everything will work from registering the car to discussing and fixing all the problems with the car (its an old car).  Notice how I said I was \u2018trying\u2019 to get in contact with my dad - being that he\u2019d lost his phone and hasn\u2019t been able to call me (didn\u2019t know my phone number).\nNow this was all until I called my grandparents who live in the same city as my dad. As it turned out, my father went to his parents house to use their phone to call me, right as I was about to call him. So fair enough, I was on the phone with my dad and we talked.\n\nSoon enough, we\u2019d planned our week ahead and eventually got onto other personal topics because we don\u2019t really call very often. By the time I say goodbye, it was about 11:35am. I was tired from the night before and try to get some rest.\n\nNo more than 15 minutes later, I get a call from my best friend. She was calling to tell me about how she and her parents got into a massive argument over the holiday we\u2019re going on in 9 days. To celebrate our passing of highschool, its tradition for students to go on a holiday somwhere in groups with the main intention to get as drunk as physically possible.\n\nWell, her parents had said that they didn\u2019t want her to go, although we\u2019ve all already paid $1000+ and booked it 6 months ago. Plans were SET, and we were ready to leave. So naturally I spent the next 45 minutes discussing what our course of action was to get around this situation.\n\nNo less than 5 minutes before I\u2019m saying bye to my friend on the phone, this lady sitting on the other side of the aisle to me raises her voice at me saying \n\n\u201care you going to stay on that fucking phone for the whole trip? You\u2019re being so rude!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm hello? How am I rude? I\u2019m talking to my friend and its only 12:30pm. That means daytime. That means people wont be sleeping\u201d\n\nNow I know that there may be some people asleep on the bus. I should know, I almost had a nap before my friend called me. But I\u2019m not sure how I was rude. If you didn\u2019t want this, then you should have flown and not caught a bus.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author was on a 10-hour bus trip using their phone for three hours. They got yelled at by a woman. Let me break down the facts.\n\nFirst, the author is 17, traveling alone, and chose a bus because it's cheaper than flying. They had to talk to their dad and then their best friend. The lady scolded them for being rude on the phone. The key points here are the duration of the phone use and the context of the conversations. \n\nThe author mentions that they were using the phone during the day, not at night, so maybe people aren't expecting to sleep. But on a bus, it's possible that some passengers might want a quiet environment, especially if they're on a long trip. However, the author had valid reasons for the calls\u2014organizing with their dad and dealing with a friend's urgent issue. \n\nBut how long was the phone use? Three hours out of ten. That's a significant portion. Even if it's daytime, constant talking might be disruptive. However, the author didn't use headphones, so maybe people could hear, leading to the complaint. The lady's reaction might be justified if the volume was loud, but the author didn't specify if they were loud. Also, the author's defense is that if people didn't want that, they should have flown, which is a bit of a flippant response. \n\nOn the other hand, the author had legitimate reasons for the calls. The first was necessary for planning a car trip, and the second was about a friend's family problem. So maybe they weren't being inconsiderate. But maybe they could have used headphones for the second call or kept the calls shorter. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether using the phone for three hours with loud calls is disruptive. Buses aren't silent environments, but excessive phone talking can be annoying. The author might not be in the wrong if they weren't loud, but given the length, maybe they should have been more considerate. But the context of necessary conversations adds nuance. Hmm. I'm leaning towards B, the author isn't in the wrong because they had valid reasons and the timing was during the day when people aren't expecting to sleep. The lady's reaction was harsh, but the author could have maybe been more considerate by using headphones or minimizing the calls. Still, the main reason for the calls seems important. So maybe the answer is B.\n"
