I was on the phone for 3 hours of a 10 hour bus trip\nSome notes:\n- this bus fare was $60 for an adult and $33 for a child (me) while a plane ticket usually averages $80 but are frequentl on sale for $60. Reason why I chose to take a bus is because I paid for the trip and I don\u2019t get paid very much from work to afford the luxury to fly just as yet.\n\n- I\u2019m 17 years old and this lady seems like she\u2019s 35-45 years old (in other words she might seem like she has some sort of authority over me because I\u2019m young and she\u2019s older)\n\n- I am travelling by myself\n\n\nSo picture this: monday morning at 9:15am 2/3rds of a bus gets filled with people to drive from Melbourne to Adelaide (~800km/500mi). I\u2019m on this bus trip for two main reasons: I have a car in Adelaide that I need to drive back to Melbourne and I also haven\u2019t seen my dad in 4 months aswell (he\u2019s the one who helped me buy the car aswell).\n\nNow up until this point, I have been trying to get in contact with my dad so I can plan this little mini-holiday and how everything will work from registering the car to discussing and fixing all the problems with the car (its an old car).  Notice how I said I was \u2018trying\u2019 to get in contact with my dad - being that he\u2019d lost his phone and hasn\u2019t been able to call me (didn\u2019t know my phone number).\nNow this was all until I called my grandparents who live in the same city as my dad. As it turned out, my father went to his parents house to use their phone to call me, right as I was about to call him. So fair enough, I was on the phone with my dad and we talked.\n\nSoon enough, we\u2019d planned our week ahead and eventually got onto other personal topics because we don\u2019t really call very often. By the time I say goodbye, it was about 11:35am. I was tired from the night before and try to get some rest.\n\nNo more than 15 minutes later, I get a call from my best friend. She was calling to tell me about how she and her parents got into a massive argument over the holiday we\u2019re going on in 9 days. To celebrate our passing of highschool, its tradition for students to go on a holiday somwhere in groups with the main intention to get as drunk as physically possible.\n\nWell, her parents had said that they didn\u2019t want her to go, although we\u2019ve all already paid $1000+ and booked it 6 months ago. Plans were SET, and we were ready to leave. So naturally I spent the next 45 minutes discussing what our course of action was to get around this situation.\n\nNo less than 5 minutes before I\u2019m saying bye to my friend on the phone, this lady sitting on the other side of the aisle to me raises her voice at me saying \n\n\u201care you going to stay on that fucking phone for the whole trip? You\u2019re being so rude!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm hello? How am I rude? I\u2019m talking to my friend and its only 12:30pm. That means daytime. That means people wont be sleeping\u201d\n\nNow I know that there may be some people asleep on the bus. I should know, I almost had a nap before my friend called me. But I\u2019m not sure how I was rude. If you didn\u2019t want this, then you should have flown and not caught a bus.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. So, the scenario is about a 17-year-old taking a 10-hour bus trip and spending three hours on the phone. The person got scolded by another passenger for being rude. The user wants to know if the author is the asshole (AITA).\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author chose a bus because it's cheaper, and they're on a budget. They were on the phone for three hours during the trip. The main points are the duration of the call and the context of why they were on the phone. \n\nThe author mentions trying to contact their dad because he lost his phone. Then they talk to their best friend about a planned trip and a conflict with her parents. They argue that it's daytime and people might not be asleep, and that if the other passenger didn't want noise, they shouldn't have taken the bus. \n\nIn public transportation etiquette, phone calls can be a common issue. People often have different expectations. Some might find loud calls annoying, especially in a confined space like a bus. However, the author was talking, not using speakerphone, so maybe not super disruptive. The time of the call is mid-morning, which is daytime, so perhaps the expectation is that people are up and less likely to need silence. \n\nThe key here is whether the volume and duration crossed the line. If the author was speaking at a normal volume and not using headphones, that could be an issue. But since they were on a phone call, it's possible others could hear. The other passenger's reaction suggests that she found it disruptive enough to confront them. \n\nThe author's defense is that it's daytime and if someone wanted silence, they should have flown. Buses are generally noisier than planes, but still, people expect some quiet. The length of the call (3 hours) is a significant portion of the trip. Even if it's daytime, some passengers might want to rest or work. \n\nHowever, the author had valid reasons: contacting family and friends about important matters. The argument here is balancing personal needs against others' comfort. The author might not be in the wrong if they were considerate of their volume and the context. But if they were loud or ignored complaints, that's different. The scolding came after three hours, which might be seen as excessive by some. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer could be that the author isn't in the wrong because they had legitimate reasons and the time was daytime, but maybe they should have been more aware of others' potential discomfort. However, the other passenger's reaction might be overblown. In AITA scenarios, the community often looks at both sides. The author's reasoning and the context might exonerate them. So, answer B (No, not in the wrong).\n"
