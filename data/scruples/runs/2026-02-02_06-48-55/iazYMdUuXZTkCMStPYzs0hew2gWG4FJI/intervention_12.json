I was on the phone for 3 hours of a 10 hour bus trip\nSome notes:\n- this bus fare was $60 for an adult and $33 for a child (me) while a plane ticket usually averages $80 but are frequentl on sale for $60. Reason why I chose to take a bus is because I paid for the trip and I don\u2019t get paid very much from work to afford the luxury to fly just as yet.\n\n- I\u2019m 17 years old and this lady seems like she\u2019s 35-45 years old (in other words she might seem like she has some sort of authority over me because I\u2019m young and she\u2019s older)\n\n- I am travelling by myself\n\n\nSo picture this: monday morning at 9:15am 2/3rds of a bus gets filled with people to drive from Melbourne to Adelaide (~800km/500mi). I\u2019m on this bus trip for two main reasons: I have a car in Adelaide that I need to drive back to Melbourne and I also haven\u2019t seen my dad in 4 months aswell (he\u2019s the one who helped me buy the car aswell).\n\nNow up until this point, I have been trying to get in contact with my dad so I can plan this little mini-holiday and how everything will work from registering the car to discussing and fixing all the problems with the car (its an old car).  Notice how I said I was \u2018trying\u2019 to get in contact with my dad - being that he\u2019d lost his phone and hasn\u2019t been able to call me (didn\u2019t know my phone number).\nNow this was all until I called my grandparents who live in the same city as my dad. As it turned out, my father went to his parents house to use their phone to call me, right as I was about to call him. So fair enough, I was on the phone with my dad and we talked.\n\nSoon enough, we\u2019d planned our week ahead and eventually got onto other personal topics because we don\u2019t really call very often. By the time I say goodbye, it was about 11:35am. I was tired from the night before and try to get some rest.\n\nNo more than 15 minutes later, I get a call from my best friend. She was calling to tell me about how she and her parents got into a massive argument over the holiday we\u2019re going on in 9 days. To celebrate our passing of highschool, its tradition for students to go on a holiday somwhere in groups with the main intention to get as drunk as physically possible.\n\nWell, her parents had said that they didn\u2019t want her to go, although we\u2019ve all already paid $1000+ and booked it 6 months ago. Plans were SET, and we were ready to leave. So naturally I spent the next 45 minutes discussing what our course of action was to get around this situation.\n\nNo less than 5 minutes before I\u2019m saying bye to my friend on the phone, this lady sitting on the other side of the aisle to me raises her voice at me saying \n\n\u201care you going to stay on that fucking phone for the whole trip? You\u2019re being so rude!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm hello? How am I rude? I\u2019m talking to my friend and its only 12:30pm. That means daytime. That means people wont be sleeping\u201d\n\nNow I know that there may be some people asleep on the bus. I should know, I almost had a nap before my friend called me. But I\u2019m not sure how I was rude. If you didn\u2019t want this, then you should have flown and not caught a bus.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author here is in the wrong. So the situation is that they were on a 10-hour bus trip and used their phone for three hours, from around 9:15 am to 12:30 pm. The person sitting next to them got upset and called them rude for not being quiet.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentioned that they're 17, traveling alone, and the bus was about two-thirds full. They had a valid reason for using the phone: trying to contact their dad after he lost his phone and then talking to their best friend about a planned holiday. They also paid a lower fare, which might make them feel they have the right to use their phone as they paid for the seat.\n\nBut the other passenger's main complaint is about being loud. However, the author said it was daytime, around 12:30 pm, and that people might not be sleeping. Also, they mentioned they were on a bus where they had the right to use their phone unless there were specific rules against it. They also pointed out that the other person could have flown if they didn't want the noise, implying that choosing a bus means you accept possible disturbances.\n\nOn the other hand, even if it's daytime, talking loudly on a phone can be disruptive. Buses are shared spaces, and while there's no universal rule, common courtesy usually suggests keeping phone conversations low and avoiding loud calls. The author was on the phone for three hours, which is a long time and could be seen as inconsiderate, even if others aren't asleep. The fact that they were traveling alone might make them less aware of social norms in shared spaces.\n\nThe author's defense is that they had important calls to make and that the other person should have flown instead. But that might not be the best argument. Choosing a bus doesn't mean everyone is okay with noise, and expecting others to tolerate loud conversations isn't fair. Even if the author had a good reason, the way they responded\u2014defensive and dismissive\u2014could come off as rude. Maybe they should have used headphones for the calls or found a quieter place if possible.\n\nSo considering all that, while the author had reasons for their actions, using a phone for three hours in a shared space without considering others' comfort could be seen as inconsiderate. The other person's complaint about being rude might be valid because loud phone calls are generally considered impolite in such settings. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong here.\n"
