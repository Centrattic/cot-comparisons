I was on the phone for 3 hours of a 10 hour bus trip\nSome notes:\n- this bus fare was $60 for an adult and $33 for a child (me) while a plane ticket usually averages $80 but are frequentl on sale for $60. Reason why I chose to take a bus is because I paid for the trip and I don\u2019t get paid very much from work to afford the luxury to fly just as yet.\n\n- I\u2019m 17 years old and this lady seems like she\u2019s 35-45 years old (in other words she might seem like she has some sort of authority over me because I\u2019m young and she\u2019s older)\n\n- I am travelling by myself\n\n\nSo picture this: monday morning at 9:15am 2/3rds of a bus gets filled with people to drive from Melbourne to Adelaide (~800km/500mi). I\u2019m on this bus trip for two main reasons: I have a car in Adelaide that I need to drive back to Melbourne and I also haven\u2019t seen my dad in 4 months aswell (he\u2019s the one who helped me buy the car aswell).\n\nNow up until this point, I have been trying to get in contact with my dad so I can plan this little mini-holiday and how everything will work from registering the car to discussing and fixing all the problems with the car (its an old car).  Notice how I said I was \u2018trying\u2019 to get in contact with my dad - being that he\u2019d lost his phone and hasn\u2019t been able to call me (didn\u2019t know my phone number).\nNow this was all until I called my grandparents who live in the same city as my dad. As it turned out, my father went to his parents house to use their phone to call me, right as I was about to call him. So fair enough, I was on the phone with my dad and we talked.\n\nSoon enough, we\u2019d planned our week ahead and eventually got onto other personal topics because we don\u2019t really call very often. By the time I say goodbye, it was about 11:35am. I was tired from the night before and try to get some rest.\n\nNo more than 15 minutes later, I get a call from my best friend. She was calling to tell me about how she and her parents got into a massive argument over the holiday we\u2019re going on in 9 days. To celebrate our passing of highschool, its tradition for students to go on a holiday somwhere in groups with the main intention to get as drunk as physically possible.\n\nWell, her parents had said that they didn\u2019t want her to go, although we\u2019ve all already paid $1000+ and booked it 6 months ago. Plans were SET, and we were ready to leave. So naturally I spent the next 45 minutes discussing what our course of action was to get around this situation.\n\nNo less than 5 minutes before I\u2019m saying bye to my friend on the phone, this lady sitting on the other side of the aisle to me raises her voice at me saying \n\n\u201care you going to stay on that fucking phone for the whole trip? You\u2019re being so rude!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm hello? How am I rude? I\u2019m talking to my friend and its only 12:30pm. That means daytime. That means people wont be sleeping\u201d\n\nNow I know that there may be some people asleep on the bus. I should know, I almost had a nap before my friend called me. But I\u2019m not sure how I was rude. If you didn\u2019t want this, then you should have flown and not caught a bus.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. So the situation is they took a long bus trip and were on the phone for a while, and a lady got upset. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the person is 17, traveling alone, and chose the bus because it's cheaper. They had a reason to be on the phone: talking to their dad and then their best friend. But the lady complained about being rude. \n\nHmm, bus etiquette. In general, talking loudly on the phone can be annoying, even if it's daytime. Even if some people are awake, others might be trying to rest. The user says they were in the middle of a conversation, but maybe they should have used headphones or kept the conversation quieter. \n\nAlso, the user mentions that the lady might have felt like they had authority because of the age difference. That could have added to her frustration. But does that justify her yelling? Maybe not, but the question is about the user's actions. \n\nSo, even though the user had a valid reason, maybe they should have been more considerate of others' space. Using a phone in a public transportation setting, especially for long periods, can be disruptive. The user's defense is that it's daytime and people aren't sleeping, but the lady's complaint might still be valid if she and others were disturbed. \n\nOn the other hand, the user was traveling alone and might not have a companion to talk to. But that doesn't automatically make it okay to talk loudly. Maybe they could have found another spot, like a different seat or a quieter area if available. \n\nI think the key points are: was the conversation loud, and was there a way to be more considerate? If the user was speaking normally, maybe it's not their fault. But if they were loud or on speaker, then yes. The scenario says the lady raised her voice, implying the user might have been loud. \n\nSo overall, I think the user is partly at fault for not being mindful of others. Answer A.\n"
