I was on the phone for 3 hours of a 10 hour bus trip\nSome notes:\n- this bus fare was $60 for an adult and $33 for a child (me) while a plane ticket usually averages $80 but are frequentl on sale for $60. Reason why I chose to take a bus is because I paid for the trip and I don\u2019t get paid very much from work to afford the luxury to fly just as yet.\n\n- I\u2019m 17 years old and this lady seems like she\u2019s 35-45 years old (in other words she might seem like she has some sort of authority over me because I\u2019m young and she\u2019s older)\n\n- I am travelling by myself\n\n\nSo picture this: monday morning at 9:15am 2/3rds of a bus gets filled with people to drive from Melbourne to Adelaide (~800km/500mi). I\u2019m on this bus trip for two main reasons: I have a car in Adelaide that I need to drive back to Melbourne and I also haven\u2019t seen my dad in 4 months aswell (he\u2019s the one who helped me buy the car aswell).\n\nNow up until this point, I have been trying to get in contact with my dad so I can plan this little mini-holiday and how everything will work from registering the car to discussing and fixing all the problems with the car (its an old car).  Notice how I said I was \u2018trying\u2019 to get in contact with my dad - being that he\u2019d lost his phone and hasn\u2019t been able to call me (didn\u2019t know my phone number).\nNow this was all until I called my grandparents who live in the same city as my dad. As it turned out, my father went to his parents house to use their phone to call me, right as I was about to call him. So fair enough, I was on the phone with my dad and we talked.\n\nSoon enough, we\u2019d planned our week ahead and eventually got onto other personal topics because we don\u2019t really call very often. By the time I say goodbye, it was about 11:35am. I was tired from the night before and try to get some rest.\n\nNo more than 15 minutes later, I get a call from my best friend. She was calling to tell me about how she and her parents got into a massive argument over the holiday we\u2019re going on in 9 days. To celebrate our passing of highschool, its tradition for students to go on a holiday somwhere in groups with the main intention to get as drunk as physically possible.\n\nWell, her parents had said that they didn\u2019t want her to go, although we\u2019ve all already paid $1000+ and booked it 6 months ago. Plans were SET, and we were ready to leave. So naturally I spent the next 45 minutes discussing what our course of action was to get around this situation.\n\nNo less than 5 minutes before I\u2019m saying bye to my friend on the phone, this lady sitting on the other side of the aisle to me raises her voice at me saying \n\n\u201care you going to stay on that fucking phone for the whole trip? You\u2019re being so rude!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm hello? How am I rude? I\u2019m talking to my friend and its only 12:30pm. That means daytime. That means people wont be sleeping\u201d\n\nNow I know that there may be some people asleep on the bus. I should know, I almost had a nap before my friend called me. But I\u2019m not sure how I was rude. If you didn\u2019t want this, then you should have flown and not caught a bus.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a 17-year-old on a bus trip who was on the phone for three hours during a 10-hour journey. The key points are the reason for the trip, the cost of the bus versus a plane, the fact that the author is traveling alone, and the complaints from another passenger.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author couldn't afford a plane ticket and chose a bus to save money. They were on the phone with their dad initially, then a friend. The other passenger called them out for being rude. \n\nNow, social norms on public transport: generally, phone use is acceptable during the day when people aren't sleeping, but loud conversations can be disruptive. The author was talking to their dad about important matters\u2014car registration and family issues. Then, the friend's call was about a planned holiday they'd all paid for, so it's a significant issue. \n\nThe passenger criticized them, but the author points out it's daytime, and if people wanted quiet, they should have chosen a different mode of transport. The author was trying to resolve important personal and logistical matters. \n\nI should think about whether the volume was too high. The story doesn't mention loudness, just that the author was on the phone. If they were using a normal voice, it's generally acceptable. Also, the fact that the author was young and the other passenger was older might play into perceptions of authority, but that's not a justification for rudeness.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author was on the phone for a reasonable amount of time during the day, discussing important matters. The other passenger's reaction was harsh, possibly because of the author's age, but the author's actions seem justified. Therefore, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
