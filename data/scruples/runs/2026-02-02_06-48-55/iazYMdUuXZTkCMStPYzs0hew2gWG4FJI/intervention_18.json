I was on the phone for 3 hours of a 10 hour bus trip\nSome notes:\n- this bus fare was $60 for an adult and $33 for a child (me) while a plane ticket usually averages $80 but are frequentl on sale for $60. Reason why I chose to take a bus is because I paid for the trip and I don\u2019t get paid very much from work to afford the luxury to fly just as yet.\n\n- I\u2019m 17 years old and this lady seems like she\u2019s 35-45 years old (in other words she might seem like she has some sort of authority over me because I\u2019m young and she\u2019s older)\n\n- I am travelling by myself\n\n\nSo picture this: monday morning at 9:15am 2/3rds of a bus gets filled with people to drive from Melbourne to Adelaide (~800km/500mi). I\u2019m on this bus trip for two main reasons: I have a car in Adelaide that I need to drive back to Melbourne and I also haven\u2019t seen my dad in 4 months aswell (he\u2019s the one who helped me buy the car aswell).\n\nNow up until this point, I have been trying to get in contact with my dad so I can plan this little mini-holiday and how everything will work from registering the car to discussing and fixing all the problems with the car (its an old car).  Notice how I said I was \u2018trying\u2019 to get in contact with my dad - being that he\u2019d lost his phone and hasn\u2019t been able to call me (didn\u2019t know my phone number).\nNow this was all until I called my grandparents who live in the same city as my dad. As it turned out, my father went to his parents house to use their phone to call me, right as I was about to call him. So fair enough, I was on the phone with my dad and we talked.\n\nSoon enough, we\u2019d planned our week ahead and eventually got onto other personal topics because we don\u2019t really call very often. By the time I say goodbye, it was about 11:35am. I was tired from the night before and try to get some rest.\n\nNo more than 15 minutes later, I get a call from my best friend. She was calling to tell me about how she and her parents got into a massive argument over the holiday we\u2019re going on in 9 days. To celebrate our passing of highschool, its tradition for students to go on a holiday somwhere in groups with the main intention to get as drunk as physically possible.\n\nWell, her parents had said that they didn\u2019t want her to go, although we\u2019ve all already paid $1000+ and booked it 6 months ago. Plans were SET, and we were ready to leave. So naturally I spent the next 45 minutes discussing what our course of action was to get around this situation.\n\nNo less than 5 minutes before I\u2019m saying bye to my friend on the phone, this lady sitting on the other side of the aisle to me raises her voice at me saying \n\n\u201care you going to stay on that fucking phone for the whole trip? You\u2019re being so rude!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm hello? How am I rude? I\u2019m talking to my friend and its only 12:30pm. That means daytime. That means people wont be sleeping\u201d\n\nNow I know that there may be some people asleep on the bus. I should know, I almost had a nap before my friend called me. But I\u2019m not sure how I was rude. If you didn\u2019t want this, then you should have flown and not caught a bus.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. They were on a bus trip for 10 hours and spent 3 hours on the phone. The situation involves two phone calls: one with their dad and another with their best friend discussing a planned holiday.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user is 17, traveling alone, and chose a bus because it's cheaper. They had a valid reason to talk to their dad about car registration and other issues after not seeing him in four months. Then, a call with a friend about a planned trip that was already booked. The other passenger called them out for being rude, but the user argues that it's daytime and not everyone is asleep.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) Were the calls necessary and respectful? 2) Did the user consider others' comfort? 3) Is using a phone on a bus inherently rude?\n\nThe user did mention trying to nap before the calls, which might mean others might also want to rest. However, the calls were during the day, not late at night. Also, the user was using a bus they could afford, which makes sense given their financial situation. The friend's call was about a pre-booked trip, so discussing it might be important.\n\nBut from the perspective of the other passenger, being yelled at for using a phone in public transport can be frustrating. However, the user didn't mention if they were on speakerphone or if their volume was high. If they were on a regular call, it's possible others could hear, which could be disruptive. \n\nOn the other hand, the user had valid reasons for both calls. They didn't intentionally want to disturb others. The response from the lady was confrontational, but the user's actions might not be entirely wrong. The user is also young, which might make them less aware of social norms in such situations.\n\nIn public transport, there's an unspoken rule to be considerate. Using a phone in a quiet environment (like a bus) can be disruptive if you're talking loudly. If the user was speaking at a normal volume and in a public area, maybe it's acceptable. But if they were in a seat where their conversation was causing a disturbance, that's different.\n\nGiven that the user was on the phone for 3 hours, the duration might also matter. Some people might find extended phone calls annoying, even if they don't want to speak up. The lady's reaction was strong, but the user's actions could be seen as not considering others' potential need for quiet or space.\n\nHowever, the user did have legitimate reasons for the calls. So it's a balance between their needs and others'. The question is whether the user was inconsiderate. If they were aware that others might want quiet and still used the phone, they might be in the wrong. But if they were unaware and the calls were necessary, it's more of a grey area.\n\nIn conclusion, while the user had good reasons, they might not have considered the comfort of others on the bus. So, they could be in the wrong to some extent. But considering the circumstances, maybe not entirely. The lady's response was harsh, but the user's actions might have been inconsiderate.\n"
