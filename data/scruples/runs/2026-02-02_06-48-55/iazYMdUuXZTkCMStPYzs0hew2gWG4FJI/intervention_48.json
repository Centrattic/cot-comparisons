I was on the phone for 3 hours of a 10 hour bus trip\nSome notes:\n- this bus fare was $60 for an adult and $33 for a child (me) while a plane ticket usually averages $80 but are frequentl on sale for $60. Reason why I chose to take a bus is because I paid for the trip and I don\u2019t get paid very much from work to afford the luxury to fly just as yet.\n\n- I\u2019m 17 years old and this lady seems like she\u2019s 35-45 years old (in other words she might seem like she has some sort of authority over me because I\u2019m young and she\u2019s older)\n\n- I am travelling by myself\n\n\nSo picture this: monday morning at 9:15am 2/3rds of a bus gets filled with people to drive from Melbourne to Adelaide (~800km/500mi). I\u2019m on this bus trip for two main reasons: I have a car in Adelaide that I need to drive back to Melbourne and I also haven\u2019t seen my dad in 4 months aswell (he\u2019s the one who helped me buy the car aswell).\n\nNow up until this point, I have been trying to get in contact with my dad so I can plan this little mini-holiday and how everything will work from registering the car to discussing and fixing all the problems with the car (its an old car).  Notice how I said I was \u2018trying\u2019 to get in contact with my dad - being that he\u2019d lost his phone and hasn\u2019t been able to call me (didn\u2019t know my phone number).\nNow this was all until I called my grandparents who live in the same city as my dad. As it turned out, my father went to his parents house to use their phone to call me, right as I was about to call him. So fair enough, I was on the phone with my dad and we talked.\n\nSoon enough, we\u2019d planned our week ahead and eventually got onto other personal topics because we don\u2019t really call very often. By the time I say goodbye, it was about 11:35am. I was tired from the night before and try to get some rest.\n\nNo more than 15 minutes later, I get a call from my best friend. She was calling to tell me about how she and her parents got into a massive argument over the holiday we\u2019re going on in 9 days. To celebrate our passing of highschool, its tradition for students to go on a holiday somwhere in groups with the main intention to get as drunk as physically possible.\n\nWell, her parents had said that they didn\u2019t want her to go, although we\u2019ve all already paid $1000+ and booked it 6 months ago. Plans were SET, and we were ready to leave. So naturally I spent the next 45 minutes discussing what our course of action was to get around this situation.\n\nNo less than 5 minutes before I\u2019m saying bye to my friend on the phone, this lady sitting on the other side of the aisle to me raises her voice at me saying \n\n\u201care you going to stay on that fucking phone for the whole trip? You\u2019re being so rude!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm hello? How am I rude? I\u2019m talking to my friend and its only 12:30pm. That means daytime. That means people wont be sleeping\u201d\n\nNow I know that there may be some people asleep on the bus. I should know, I almost had a nap before my friend called me. But I\u2019m not sure how I was rude. If you didn\u2019t want this, then you should have flown and not caught a bus.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a 17-year-old on a 10-hour bus trip who was on the phone for 3 hours. The key points are that they were talking to their dad and then their best friend, and an older woman on the bus criticized them for being rude.\n\nFirst, I need to consider bus etiquette. On buses, especially long ones, people expect a certain level of quietness. But the person was on the phone during daytime, not late at night. The user argues that since it's daytime, others might not be sleeping. However, even during the day, loud phone calls can be disruptive because some people might need to work, read, or rest. The author was using their phone for personal calls, which might be seen as not considering others' comfort.\n\nThe author's defense is that they paid for the trip because they can't afford a flight and that the woman should have flown if she wanted less noise. But that's a bit of a dismissive argument. Choosing a cheaper option doesn't necessarily give someone the right to be as loud as they want. Also, the woman's complaint was about rudeness, which is subjective, but in many social contexts, keeping phone calls low and considerate is expected.\n\nThe author's friend call was after a conversation with their dad. The initial call with the dad was for planning important matters (car and family), which might be more justified, but the friend call that followed could be seen as social and less urgent. However, the total time on the phone was 3 hours, which is a significant portion of the trip. Even if part of it was necessary, the combined time might be excessive.\n\nThe age difference is mentioned, with the author being 17 and the lady 35-45. The author might feel the lady is being authoritative, but that doesn't negate the validity of the complaint. The lady's raised voice and choice of language (\"fucking phone\") was rude, but the author's response was defensive. Instead of apologizing or asking to lower their voice, the author was confrontational, which might escalate the situation.\n\nIn terms of social norms, it's common to be considerate in shared spaces. Even if the author had their reasons, being on the phone for 3 hours without considering others' comfort could be seen as inconsiderate. The author's justification about paying for the trip and the time of day doesn't fully address the disruption caused. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not being considerate enough, even if the calls were important. However, the lady's response was also uncalled for, but the question is about the author's actions.\n\nSo, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they were being inconsiderate with their phone use, even if they had reasons. The key is balancing personal needs with others' comfort in shared spaces.\n"
