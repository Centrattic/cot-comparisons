I was on the phone for 3 hours of a 10 hour bus trip\nSome notes:\n- this bus fare was $60 for an adult and $33 for a child (me) while a plane ticket usually averages $80 but are frequentl on sale for $60. Reason why I chose to take a bus is because I paid for the trip and I don\u2019t get paid very much from work to afford the luxury to fly just as yet.\n\n- I\u2019m 17 years old and this lady seems like she\u2019s 35-45 years old (in other words she might seem like she has some sort of authority over me because I\u2019m young and she\u2019s older)\n\n- I am travelling by myself\n\n\nSo picture this: monday morning at 9:15am 2/3rds of a bus gets filled with people to drive from Melbourne to Adelaide (~800km/500mi). I\u2019m on this bus trip for two main reasons: I have a car in Adelaide that I need to drive back to Melbourne and I also haven\u2019t seen my dad in 4 months aswell (he\u2019s the one who helped me buy the car aswell).\n\nNow up until this point, I have been trying to get in contact with my dad so I can plan this little mini-holiday and how everything will work from registering the car to discussing and fixing all the problems with the car (its an old car).  Notice how I said I was \u2018trying\u2019 to get in contact with my dad - being that he\u2019d lost his phone and hasn\u2019t been able to call me (didn\u2019t know my phone number).\nNow this was all until I called my grandparents who live in the same city as my dad. As it turned out, my father went to his parents house to use their phone to call me, right as I was about to call him. So fair enough, I was on the phone with my dad and we talked.\n\nSoon enough, we\u2019d planned our week ahead and eventually got onto other personal topics because we don\u2019t really call very often. By the time I say goodbye, it was about 11:35am. I was tired from the night before and try to get some rest.\n\nNo more than 15 minutes later, I get a call from my best friend. She was calling to tell me about how she and her parents got into a massive argument over the holiday we\u2019re going on in 9 days. To celebrate our passing of highschool, its tradition for students to go on a holiday somwhere in groups with the main intention to get as drunk as physically possible.\n\nWell, her parents had said that they didn\u2019t want her to go, although we\u2019ve all already paid $1000+ and booked it 6 months ago. Plans were SET, and we were ready to leave. So naturally I spent the next 45 minutes discussing what our course of action was to get around this situation.\n\nNo less than 5 minutes before I\u2019m saying bye to my friend on the phone, this lady sitting on the other side of the aisle to me raises her voice at me saying \n\n\u201care you going to stay on that fucking phone for the whole trip? You\u2019re being so rude!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm hello? How am I rude? I\u2019m talking to my friend and its only 12:30pm. That means daytime. That means people wont be sleeping\u201d\n\nNow I know that there may be some people asleep on the bus. I should know, I almost had a nap before my friend called me. But I\u2019m not sure how I was rude. If you didn\u2019t want this, then you should have flown and not caught a bus.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they were on a bus for 10 hours, and they were on the phone for 3 hours. They were talking to their dad and then their best friend. The lady next to them got upset and told them to stop being rude. \n\nFirst, the author mentions they paid for the trip themselves and it's cheaper to take the bus. They are 17, traveling alone, and have important reasons for being on the phone. The bus ride is part of a longer trip to see their dad, and they had to coordinate car issues. Then there's the friend situation where the parents changed their mind about the holiday. \n\nThe key points here are: was the phone use disruptive? The author says it was daytime, and people might not be sleeping, but some might be. They were talking to family and friends about important matters. The lady's complaint is about being rude because of the phone use. \n\nPublic transportation etiquette usually suggests that talking on phones should be kept to a minimum, especially if it's loud enough to bother others. But the author argues that they were in the daytime, not during a time when people would expect silence. Also, the phone calls were for necessary coordination and a friend's emergency.\n\nHowever, even if the calls were necessary, the volume and duration could matter. If the author was speaking loudly or for a long time, that could be an issue. But the context here is that they were discussing important personal and family matters, which might be seen as justification. The author also mentions they tried to rest before the friend called, implying that maybe they weren't the only ones wanting to rest.\n\nThe lady's reaction could be based on personal sensitivity, but public transport often requires consideration of others. However, the author's situation seems valid. They didn't choose to take the bus for leisure; it's a cost-saving measure. The friend's call was about a planned event that the parents are now blocking, which is a stressful situation.\n\nSo, weighing these factors: the author's use of the phone was for important reasons, during daytime when others might be awake, and they might not have intended to disrupt. The lady's complaint is about being rude, but the author's actions might be seen as reasonable given the circumstances. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
