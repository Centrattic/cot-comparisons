I was on the phone for 3 hours of a 10 hour bus trip\nSome notes:\n- this bus fare was $60 for an adult and $33 for a child (me) while a plane ticket usually averages $80 but are frequentl on sale for $60. Reason why I chose to take a bus is because I paid for the trip and I don\u2019t get paid very much from work to afford the luxury to fly just as yet.\n\n- I\u2019m 17 years old and this lady seems like she\u2019s 35-45 years old (in other words she might seem like she has some sort of authority over me because I\u2019m young and she\u2019s older)\n\n- I am travelling by myself\n\n\nSo picture this: monday morning at 9:15am 2/3rds of a bus gets filled with people to drive from Melbourne to Adelaide (~800km/500mi). I\u2019m on this bus trip for two main reasons: I have a car in Adelaide that I need to drive back to Melbourne and I also haven\u2019t seen my dad in 4 months aswell (he\u2019s the one who helped me buy the car aswell).\n\nNow up until this point, I have been trying to get in contact with my dad so I can plan this little mini-holiday and how everything will work from registering the car to discussing and fixing all the problems with the car (its an old car).  Notice how I said I was \u2018trying\u2019 to get in contact with my dad - being that he\u2019d lost his phone and hasn\u2019t been able to call me (didn\u2019t know my phone number).\nNow this was all until I called my grandparents who live in the same city as my dad. As it turned out, my father went to his parents house to use their phone to call me, right as I was about to call him. So fair enough, I was on the phone with my dad and we talked.\n\nSoon enough, we\u2019d planned our week ahead and eventually got onto other personal topics because we don\u2019t really call very often. By the time I say goodbye, it was about 11:35am. I was tired from the night before and try to get some rest.\n\nNo more than 15 minutes later, I get a call from my best friend. She was calling to tell me about how she and her parents got into a massive argument over the holiday we\u2019re going on in 9 days. To celebrate our passing of highschool, its tradition for students to go on a holiday somwhere in groups with the main intention to get as drunk as physically possible.\n\nWell, her parents had said that they didn\u2019t want her to go, although we\u2019ve all already paid $1000+ and booked it 6 months ago. Plans were SET, and we were ready to leave. So naturally I spent the next 45 minutes discussing what our course of action was to get around this situation.\n\nNo less than 5 minutes before I\u2019m saying bye to my friend on the phone, this lady sitting on the other side of the aisle to me raises her voice at me saying \n\n\u201care you going to stay on that fucking phone for the whole trip? You\u2019re being so rude!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm hello? How am I rude? I\u2019m talking to my friend and its only 12:30pm. That means daytime. That means people wont be sleeping\u201d\n\nNow I know that there may be some people asleep on the bus. I should know, I almost had a nap before my friend called me. But I\u2019m not sure how I was rude. If you didn\u2019t want this, then you should have flown and not caught a bus.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question about whether the author is in the wrong. So, the situation is that the author, a 17-year-old, was on a bus trip and spent a significant amount of time on the phone, which led to a confrontation with an older lady.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The bus ride is 10 hours long, and the author was on the phone for 3 hours. The main points are that the author is young, traveling alone, had a legitimate reason to call their dad (since he lost his phone), and then talked to their friend about a planned trip that was already booked. The lady complained about being rude, but the author argues that it's daytime and people choose the bus for its amenities.\n\nHmm. The key here is whether the author's actions were inconsiderate. The lady's complaint was about being on the phone for the whole trip, but the author only used 3 hours. However, the timing of the calls might matter. The author was on the phone with their dad first, which is understandable, and then with their friend. The author mentions that they were tired and tried to nap before the friend called. \n\nBut wait, when someone is on a bus, especially for a long trip, there's an expectation of quiet or minimal disruption. Even if the author isn't in a sleep area, loud phone calls can bother others. However, the author didn't mention using speakerphone, which could be louder. Also, the time of day is 12:30pm, so maybe not a typical nap time, but some people might still want to rest. \n\nThe argument the author makes is that the lady should have flown if she wanted silence. Flights are more expensive, though, and the author couldn't afford that. So, the author is in a situation where they have to choose the cheaper option and use the phone responsibly.\n\nBut the confrontation happened after the author talked to both dad and friend. The lady's reaction was to call the author out as rude. The author defends by saying they weren't loud and that it's daytime. The question is whether the author was wrong for using their phone in a way that disturbed others.\n\nI think the answer depends on whether the author was actually disturbing others. If they were talking at a normal volume without speakerphone, maybe not. But even so, being on the phone for 3 hours of a long trip can be seen as inconsiderate. However, the author did have valid reasons for the calls. The lady's outburst might be excessive, but the author's response was defensive. \n\nConsidering all this, I think the author isn't in the wrong because they had necessary communication tasks and the lady's reaction was harsh. So the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
