I was on the phone for 3 hours of a 10 hour bus trip\nSome notes:\n- this bus fare was $60 for an adult and $33 for a child (me) while a plane ticket usually averages $80 but are frequentl on sale for $60. Reason why I chose to take a bus is because I paid for the trip and I don\u2019t get paid very much from work to afford the luxury to fly just as yet.\n\n- I\u2019m 17 years old and this lady seems like she\u2019s 35-45 years old (in other words she might seem like she has some sort of authority over me because I\u2019m young and she\u2019s older)\n\n- I am travelling by myself\n\n\nSo picture this: monday morning at 9:15am 2/3rds of a bus gets filled with people to drive from Melbourne to Adelaide (~800km/500mi). I\u2019m on this bus trip for two main reasons: I have a car in Adelaide that I need to drive back to Melbourne and I also haven\u2019t seen my dad in 4 months aswell (he\u2019s the one who helped me buy the car aswell).\n\nNow up until this point, I have been trying to get in contact with my dad so I can plan this little mini-holiday and how everything will work from registering the car to discussing and fixing all the problems with the car (its an old car).  Notice how I said I was \u2018trying\u2019 to get in contact with my dad - being that he\u2019d lost his phone and hasn\u2019t been able to call me (didn\u2019t know my phone number).\nNow this was all until I called my grandparents who live in the same city as my dad. As it turned out, my father went to his parents house to use their phone to call me, right as I was about to call him. So fair enough, I was on the phone with my dad and we talked.\n\nSoon enough, we\u2019d planned our week ahead and eventually got onto other personal topics because we don\u2019t really call very often. By the time I say goodbye, it was about 11:35am. I was tired from the night before and try to get some rest.\n\nNo more than 15 minutes later, I get a call from my best friend. She was calling to tell me about how she and her parents got into a massive argument over the holiday we\u2019re going on in 9 days. To celebrate our passing of highschool, its tradition for students to go on a holiday somwhere in groups with the main intention to get as drunk as physically possible.\n\nWell, her parents had said that they didn\u2019t want her to go, although we\u2019ve all already paid $1000+ and booked it 6 months ago. Plans were SET, and we were ready to leave. So naturally I spent the next 45 minutes discussing what our course of action was to get around this situation.\n\nNo less than 5 minutes before I\u2019m saying bye to my friend on the phone, this lady sitting on the other side of the aisle to me raises her voice at me saying \n\n\u201care you going to stay on that fucking phone for the whole trip? You\u2019re being so rude!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm hello? How am I rude? I\u2019m talking to my friend and its only 12:30pm. That means daytime. That means people wont be sleeping\u201d\n\nNow I know that there may be some people asleep on the bus. I should know, I almost had a nap before my friend called me. But I\u2019m not sure how I was rude. If you didn\u2019t want this, then you should have flown and not caught a bus.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, a 17-year-old, was on the phone for 3 hours during a 10-hour bus trip. The key points are that they were talking to their dad and then their best friend about important matters, and a woman on the bus got upset because they were using their phone so much.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is traveling alone, which might make it more challenging. They had a legitimate reason to be on the phone: coordinating with their dad about car issues and discussing a holiday with a friend. The initial call with the dad was necessary because he lost his phone and they were reconnecting after 4 months. Then, the call with the friend was about a pre-booked trip, which is a significant amount of money and planning involved. \n\nThe lady's complaint is about the author being on the phone, possibly disturbing others. However, the author points out that it was daytime and people might not be sleeping. The bus was already two-thirds full, so there's a shared space. But the duration of the phone calls is 3 hours, which is a substantial part of the trip. \n\nIn public transportation etiquette, there's often an unspoken rule about keeping noise to a minimum, especially in shared spaces. While the author had valid reasons, 3 hours of phone calls could be seen as disruptive, even if others aren't necessarily sleeping. The lady's reaction might be justified if the volume was too high or if others were trying to work or rest. However, the author didn't mention using headphones or keeping the volume low, which could have mitigated the issue. \n\nAlso, the age difference might play a role. The author is a minor, and the lady is older, leading to possible assumptions about authority or maturity. But that shouldn't mean the author isn't expected to follow social norms. \n\nOn the other hand, the author had valid, time-sensitive reasons for the calls. The initial call with the dad was after a long time and involved important planning. The friend's call was about a trip they'd already paid for, which is a stress point. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author's actions were unreasonable despite these reasons. While the call durations were long, in a public setting like a bus, balancing personal needs with others' comfort is important. If the author didn't take steps to minimize disturbance (like using headphones or speaking quietly), then they might be at fault. However, if they were using a hands-free device and keeping the volume low, it's less clear. \n\nThe author's defense is that it's daytime and people aren't necessarily sleeping, but even in daytime, a bus is a shared space where people might need to rest, work, or read. Three hours of phone calls could be seen as excessive unless necessary. The initial 35-minute call with the dad and then a 45-minute call with the friend, totaling around 80 minutes, but the user said 3 hours. Maybe there were multiple calls or the duration extended more than mentioned. \n\nGiven that, the lady's complaint is about being rude, and the author's response is defensive. The author could have been more considerate by seeking a quiet time or using headphones. However, considering the necessity of the calls, maybe it's not entirely their fault. The answer might hinge on whether the calls were unavoidable and if the author took steps to minimize disruption. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be entirely at fault because the calls were for valid reasons, but they could have been more mindful of others' comfort. However, if the calls were disruptive regardless of the reason, then they might be in the wrong. The key is whether the author's actions were considerate enough given the shared space.\n"
