I was on the phone for 3 hours of a 10 hour bus trip\nSome notes:\n- this bus fare was $60 for an adult and $33 for a child (me) while a plane ticket usually averages $80 but are frequentl on sale for $60. Reason why I chose to take a bus is because I paid for the trip and I don\u2019t get paid very much from work to afford the luxury to fly just as yet.\n\n- I\u2019m 17 years old and this lady seems like she\u2019s 35-45 years old (in other words she might seem like she has some sort of authority over me because I\u2019m young and she\u2019s older)\n\n- I am travelling by myself\n\n\nSo picture this: monday morning at 9:15am 2/3rds of a bus gets filled with people to drive from Melbourne to Adelaide (~800km/500mi). I\u2019m on this bus trip for two main reasons: I have a car in Adelaide that I need to drive back to Melbourne and I also haven\u2019t seen my dad in 4 months aswell (he\u2019s the one who helped me buy the car aswell).\n\nNow up until this point, I have been trying to get in contact with my dad so I can plan this little mini-holiday and how everything will work from registering the car to discussing and fixing all the problems with the car (its an old car).  Notice how I said I was \u2018trying\u2019 to get in contact with my dad - being that he\u2019d lost his phone and hasn\u2019t been able to call me (didn\u2019t know my phone number).\nNow this was all until I called my grandparents who live in the same city as my dad. As it turned out, my father went to his parents house to use their phone to call me, right as I was about to call him. So fair enough, I was on the phone with my dad and we talked.\n\nSoon enough, we\u2019d planned our week ahead and eventually got onto other personal topics because we don\u2019t really call very often. By the time I say goodbye, it was about 11:35am. I was tired from the night before and try to get some rest.\n\nNo more than 15 minutes later, I get a call from my best friend. She was calling to tell me about how she and her parents got into a massive argument over the holiday we\u2019re going on in 9 days. To celebrate our passing of highschool, its tradition for students to go on a holiday somwhere in groups with the main intention to get as drunk as physically possible.\n\nWell, her parents had said that they didn\u2019t want her to go, although we\u2019ve all already paid $1000+ and booked it 6 months ago. Plans were SET, and we were ready to leave. So naturally I spent the next 45 minutes discussing what our course of action was to get around this situation.\n\nNo less than 5 minutes before I\u2019m saying bye to my friend on the phone, this lady sitting on the other side of the aisle to me raises her voice at me saying \n\n\u201care you going to stay on that fucking phone for the whole trip? You\u2019re being so rude!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm hello? How am I rude? I\u2019m talking to my friend and its only 12:30pm. That means daytime. That means people wont be sleeping\u201d\n\nNow I know that there may be some people asleep on the bus. I should know, I almost had a nap before my friend called me. But I\u2019m not sure how I was rude. If you didn\u2019t want this, then you should have flown and not caught a bus.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break down this situation. The user is 17 and on a 10-hour bus ride. They were on the phone for 3 hours. The main points are the timing (it was morning, not everyone would be asleep), the reason for the call (planning a trip and personal issues), and the fact that they were using a bus because it's cheaper.\n\nFirst, the lady got angry about the phone use. The user argues it's daytime and they were talking to a friend. But even in the morning, some people might be trying to read, work, or just be quiet on the bus. The user was on the phone for a significant portion of the trip, which could be disruptive despite the time. Also, the user is young and traveling alone, which might make the situation more sensitive, but that doesn't necessarily excuse loud phone calls in a shared space. \n\nThe user mentions they paid for the trip and can't afford a plane yet. That's their reasoning for being on the bus, but it's not a factor in whether their behavior was rude. The key is about respecting others' space. Even if the user had a good reason, if their phone call was loud or disrupting others, they might be in the wrong. The lady's reaction could be justified if the user was being loud, but the user didn't mention being loud. They just said they were talking to friends. \n\nHowever, the user was on the phone for 45 minutes with their friend about a planned trip, and before that, 2 hours with their dad. That's a total of 2.5 hours or so. 3 hours out of a 10-hour trip is 30%, which is a lot. The user's response was defensive, which might come off as dismissive. The lady's complaint might be about volume or the length of the call, but the user didn't specify if they were speaking quietly. \n\nIn public transport, there's an unspoken rule to keep phone calls to a minimum to respect others. The user's argument that the lady should have flown is a bit of a straw man. The issue isn't about the mode of transport but about being considerate. If the user was talking at normal volume and not disturbing anyone, maybe not. But the lady felt the need to raise her voice, implying the user was causing a disturbance. \n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? It depends on the context. If they were being loud, then yes. If they were speaking quietly but the duration was an issue, then maybe not. The user's defense seems to be based on the time of day and the lady's choice of transport, which might not address the actual problem. The user didn't consider that even if it's daytime, a long phone call can be annoying. They also didn't ask if it was okay to talk, which is a common courtesy. \n\nThe lady's comment was harsh, but the user's actions could have been more considerate. The answer is probably A (in the wrong) because they were on the phone for a long time, maybe loudly, and didn't show consideration for other passengers. The defensive reaction without acknowledging possible disruption also supports that.\n"
