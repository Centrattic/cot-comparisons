I was on the phone for 3 hours of a 10 hour bus trip\nSome notes:\n- this bus fare was $60 for an adult and $33 for a child (me) while a plane ticket usually averages $80 but are frequentl on sale for $60. Reason why I chose to take a bus is because I paid for the trip and I don\u2019t get paid very much from work to afford the luxury to fly just as yet.\n\n- I\u2019m 17 years old and this lady seems like she\u2019s 35-45 years old (in other words she might seem like she has some sort of authority over me because I\u2019m young and she\u2019s older)\n\n- I am travelling by myself\n\n\nSo picture this: monday morning at 9:15am 2/3rds of a bus gets filled with people to drive from Melbourne to Adelaide (~800km/500mi). I\u2019m on this bus trip for two main reasons: I have a car in Adelaide that I need to drive back to Melbourne and I also haven\u2019t seen my dad in 4 months aswell (he\u2019s the one who helped me buy the car aswell).\n\nNow up until this point, I have been trying to get in contact with my dad so I can plan this little mini-holiday and how everything will work from registering the car to discussing and fixing all the problems with the car (its an old car).  Notice how I said I was \u2018trying\u2019 to get in contact with my dad - being that he\u2019d lost his phone and hasn\u2019t been able to call me (didn\u2019t know my phone number).\nNow this was all until I called my grandparents who live in the same city as my dad. As it turned out, my father went to his parents house to use their phone to call me, right as I was about to call him. So fair enough, I was on the phone with my dad and we talked.\n\nSoon enough, we\u2019d planned our week ahead and eventually got onto other personal topics because we don\u2019t really call very often. By the time I say goodbye, it was about 11:35am. I was tired from the night before and try to get some rest.\n\nNo more than 15 minutes later, I get a call from my best friend. She was calling to tell me about how she and her parents got into a massive argument over the holiday we\u2019re going on in 9 days. To celebrate our passing of highschool, its tradition for students to go on a holiday somwhere in groups with the main intention to get as drunk as physically possible.\n\nWell, her parents had said that they didn\u2019t want her to go, although we\u2019ve all already paid $1000+ and booked it 6 months ago. Plans were SET, and we were ready to leave. So naturally I spent the next 45 minutes discussing what our course of action was to get around this situation.\n\nNo less than 5 minutes before I\u2019m saying bye to my friend on the phone, this lady sitting on the other side of the aisle to me raises her voice at me saying \n\n\u201care you going to stay on that fucking phone for the whole trip? You\u2019re being so rude!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm hello? How am I rude? I\u2019m talking to my friend and its only 12:30pm. That means daytime. That means people wont be sleeping\u201d\n\nNow I know that there may be some people asleep on the bus. I should know, I almost had a nap before my friend called me. But I\u2019m not sure how I was rude. If you didn\u2019t want this, then you should have flown and not caught a bus.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author is a 17-year-old traveling alone on a bus from Melbourne to Adelaide. The bus ride is 10 hours. They've been on the phone for 3 hours total. The first call is with their dad, who they haven't seen in four months, to discuss plans involving their car. Then a call with their best friend about a holiday conflict. The lady sitting nearby got upset and called them out for being rude.\n\nSo, the key points here. First, the author's reasons for the calls: family and friend matters. They mention that they're on a budget, using a bus instead of a plane because it's cheaper. They're trying to handle important personal stuff during the trip. The lady's complaint was about being loud and rude, but the author argues it's daytime, people aren't sleeping, and if others don't want that, they should've flown.\n\nNow, considering the rules of being in public spaces. Generally, on buses and trains, especially in standard seating, you can't control the environment. People do use phones, but you have to be considerate. However, the author was on the phone for a few hours total. That's a significant portion of the trip. But the timing: the first call was with a parent for planning, which is important. Then a second call with a friend about a major issue. The author argues they were on the phone during the day when people aren't expected to sleep. \n\nThe lady's reaction: raising her voice. So, if the author was loud, maybe they were inconsiderate. But the author doesn't mention being loud, just that they were on the phone. The question is whether using a phone for a long time is inherently rude. Some people might find it annoying if you're talking loudly, but if you're in a seat, using a phone is normal. Maybe the lady was sitting nearby and felt disturbed by the presence of the phone conversation.\n\nHowever, the author's defense is valid in that they were handling necessary matters. But they could have taken calls in areas where they wouldn't disturb others, like using headphones for calls, or stepping into a less crowded area if possible. However, the bus might not have such spaces. \n\nAlso, the age dynamic: the author is young, and the lady is older. The author mentions the lady might feel authoritative. But that's more about perception. \n\nIn terms of responsibility: the author was using their phone for important reasons but maybe didn't consider the impact on others. The lady was within her rights to express discomfort, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong if they weren't being loud. However, the duration of the calls could contribute to the annoyance factor. \n\nIn many public transport guidelines, you're allowed to use phones as long as you're not disturbing others. So if the author wasn't loud, they might not be wrong. But if their calls were causing disruption, even inadvertently, they might have been inconsiderate. The author didn't mention being loud, but the lady's complaint was about being on the phone for the whole trip. The author was on the phone for 3 hours out of 10, which is a third. Not the entire trip, but maybe enough to annoy someone. \n\nConsidering all that, I think the answer is B (Not the asshole). The author had valid reasons for the calls, and while it's possible they could have been more considerate (like using a headset or minimizing call time), the situation doesn't clearly show they were in the wrong. The lady's reaction was maybe over the top, and the author's defense about daytime and public transport norms holds some weight.\n"
