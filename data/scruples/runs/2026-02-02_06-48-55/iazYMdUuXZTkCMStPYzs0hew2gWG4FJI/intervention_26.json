I was on the phone for 3 hours of a 10 hour bus trip\nSome notes:\n- this bus fare was $60 for an adult and $33 for a child (me) while a plane ticket usually averages $80 but are frequentl on sale for $60. Reason why I chose to take a bus is because I paid for the trip and I don\u2019t get paid very much from work to afford the luxury to fly just as yet.\n\n- I\u2019m 17 years old and this lady seems like she\u2019s 35-45 years old (in other words she might seem like she has some sort of authority over me because I\u2019m young and she\u2019s older)\n\n- I am travelling by myself\n\n\nSo picture this: monday morning at 9:15am 2/3rds of a bus gets filled with people to drive from Melbourne to Adelaide (~800km/500mi). I\u2019m on this bus trip for two main reasons: I have a car in Adelaide that I need to drive back to Melbourne and I also haven\u2019t seen my dad in 4 months aswell (he\u2019s the one who helped me buy the car aswell).\n\nNow up until this point, I have been trying to get in contact with my dad so I can plan this little mini-holiday and how everything will work from registering the car to discussing and fixing all the problems with the car (its an old car).  Notice how I said I was \u2018trying\u2019 to get in contact with my dad - being that he\u2019d lost his phone and hasn\u2019t been able to call me (didn\u2019t know my phone number).\nNow this was all until I called my grandparents who live in the same city as my dad. As it turned out, my father went to his parents house to use their phone to call me, right as I was about to call him. So fair enough, I was on the phone with my dad and we talked.\n\nSoon enough, we\u2019d planned our week ahead and eventually got onto other personal topics because we don\u2019t really call very often. By the time I say goodbye, it was about 11:35am. I was tired from the night before and try to get some rest.\n\nNo more than 15 minutes later, I get a call from my best friend. She was calling to tell me about how she and her parents got into a massive argument over the holiday we\u2019re going on in 9 days. To celebrate our passing of highschool, its tradition for students to go on a holiday somwhere in groups with the main intention to get as drunk as physically possible.\n\nWell, her parents had said that they didn\u2019t want her to go, although we\u2019ve all already paid $1000+ and booked it 6 months ago. Plans were SET, and we were ready to leave. So naturally I spent the next 45 minutes discussing what our course of action was to get around this situation.\n\nNo less than 5 minutes before I\u2019m saying bye to my friend on the phone, this lady sitting on the other side of the aisle to me raises her voice at me saying \n\n\u201care you going to stay on that fucking phone for the whole trip? You\u2019re being so rude!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm hello? How am I rude? I\u2019m talking to my friend and its only 12:30pm. That means daytime. That means people wont be sleeping\u201d\n\nNow I know that there may be some people asleep on the bus. I should know, I almost had a nap before my friend called me. But I\u2019m not sure how I was rude. If you didn\u2019t want this, then you should have flown and not caught a bus.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author, a 17-year-old, spent 3 hours on the phone during a 10-hour bus ride. The main points are:\n\n1. The bus fare was cheaper for a child, and the author couldn't afford a plane ticket. So they chose the bus because of cost.\n2. They were trying to contact their dad, who had lost his phone. They finally connected and talked for a while, then later talked to their best friend about a holiday plan.\n3. A lady on the bus yelled at them for being rude on the phone. The author's defense is that it's daytime and people might be sleeping, but they almost had a nap before the friend called.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author was in the wrong. The key factors here are the appropriateness of phone use on a public transport and the context. Bus trips can vary in how quiet they need to be, but generally, people expect a certain level of quiet, especially during weekday mornings when people might be commuting or trying to rest. The author was on the phone for a long time with two different people. \n\nThe first call was with their dad about important matters\u2014car issues and reuniting after 4 months. That seems reasonable, as it's a necessary conversation. The second call was with a friend about a holiday, which is social. Even though the author is young and traveling alone, using a phone for extended periods in a public space where others might find it disruptive can be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nThe lady's complaint is about loud phone use. Even if it's daytime, some people need rest, especially on a long trip. The author didn't mention using headphones or keeping the volume low, which would have been more respectful. Also, the fact that they were talking for such a long duration might have been the issue. \n\nThe author's response was defensive, implying that the lady should have flown instead of taking the bus. That's a bit of a passive-aggressive remark and might not be the best way to handle the situation. While the author has a valid reason for the calls, the way they responded and the duration of the calls could have been problematic. \n\nSo, considering the context, the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but they should have been more mindful of their surroundings. The lady had a right to be upset if the conversation was loud and disruptive. The age difference and the conversational topics don't excuse loud talking on a bus. The author could have used headphones or moved to a less crowded area. Therefore, there's some fault on the author's side even if the reasons for the calls were important. \n\nBut wait, the user thought the author was in the wrong, and the options are A (Yes) or B (No). The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Given that the lady complained and the author was on the phone for 3 hours, which is a significant portion of the trip, and didn't mention taking steps to be quiet, I think the answer is A. However, maybe the age factor and their reasons mitigate it. The author's defense is a bit dismissive. \n\nBut according to the initial analysis, the author's actions might be seen as inconsiderate, so A is the answer. However, others might argue that the lady was being judgmental. The key point is whether the phone use was disruptive. If they were speaking loudly and not using headphones, then the author is in the wrong. So the answer is A.\n"
