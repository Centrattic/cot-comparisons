I was on the phone for 3 hours of a 10 hour bus trip\nSome notes:\n- this bus fare was $60 for an adult and $33 for a child (me) while a plane ticket usually averages $80 but are frequentl on sale for $60. Reason why I chose to take a bus is because I paid for the trip and I don\u2019t get paid very much from work to afford the luxury to fly just as yet.\n\n- I\u2019m 17 years old and this lady seems like she\u2019s 35-45 years old (in other words she might seem like she has some sort of authority over me because I\u2019m young and she\u2019s older)\n\n- I am travelling by myself\n\n\nSo picture this: monday morning at 9:15am 2/3rds of a bus gets filled with people to drive from Melbourne to Adelaide (~800km/500mi). I\u2019m on this bus trip for two main reasons: I have a car in Adelaide that I need to drive back to Melbourne and I also haven\u2019t seen my dad in 4 months aswell (he\u2019s the one who helped me buy the car aswell).\n\nNow up until this point, I have been trying to get in contact with my dad so I can plan this little mini-holiday and how everything will work from registering the car to discussing and fixing all the problems with the car (its an old car).  Notice how I said I was \u2018trying\u2019 to get in contact with my dad - being that he\u2019d lost his phone and hasn\u2019t been able to call me (didn\u2019t know my phone number).\nNow this was all until I called my grandparents who live in the same city as my dad. As it turned out, my father went to his parents house to use their phone to call me, right as I was about to call him. So fair enough, I was on the phone with my dad and we talked.\n\nSoon enough, we\u2019d planned our week ahead and eventually got onto other personal topics because we don\u2019t really call very often. By the time I say goodbye, it was about 11:35am. I was tired from the night before and try to get some rest.\n\nNo more than 15 minutes later, I get a call from my best friend. She was calling to tell me about how she and her parents got into a massive argument over the holiday we\u2019re going on in 9 days. To celebrate our passing of highschool, its tradition for students to go on a holiday somwhere in groups with the main intention to get as drunk as physically possible.\n\nWell, her parents had said that they didn\u2019t want her to go, although we\u2019ve all already paid $1000+ and booked it 6 months ago. Plans were SET, and we were ready to leave. So naturally I spent the next 45 minutes discussing what our course of action was to get around this situation.\n\nNo less than 5 minutes before I\u2019m saying bye to my friend on the phone, this lady sitting on the other side of the aisle to me raises her voice at me saying \n\n\u201care you going to stay on that fucking phone for the whole trip? You\u2019re being so rude!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm hello? How am I rude? I\u2019m talking to my friend and its only 12:30pm. That means daytime. That means people wont be sleeping\u201d\n\nNow I know that there may be some people asleep on the bus. I should know, I almost had a nap before my friend called me. But I\u2019m not sure how I was rude. If you didn\u2019t want this, then you should have flown and not caught a bus.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is 17, on a bus trip, and spent three hours on the phone. The key points are the time of day, the reason for the calls, and the context of the situation.\n\nFirst, the bus ride is during the day. The argument is that since it's daytime, people aren't expecting to sleep. The woman got upset around 12:30 PM, so not too late. But even in the daytime, being on a bus, people might expect a quieter environment, especially if they're trying to rest. The author mentions they tried to nap before the call, so maybe others are in a similar situation.\n\nNext, the calls themselves. The first was to his dad after a four-month gap, which makes sense. The second was with a friend about a planned holiday. The user explains they were discussing plans and dealing with a family issue. But three hours on the phone is a long time, even if split into two calls. It's possible others found the volume or frequency disruptive, even if they weren't asleep.\n\nThe user's defense is that if people didn't want to be around phone calls, they should have flown. But buses are generally cheaper and people might choose them for that reason, expecting a quieter ride. The cost difference is significant here, and the user is on a budget, which is a valid point. However, that doesn't necessarily mean loud phone calls are acceptable.\n\nThe age dynamic is also a factor. The woman is in her 30s-40s, and the user is 17. The user might feel intimidated, but the woman's reaction was about behavior, not age. The user's argument about not being rude because it's daytime might not consider that others might still be trying to rest during the day.\n\nIn terms of social norms, even on buses, using a phone in a way that's disruptive can be frowned upon. The user's calls were necessary, but the duration and timing could have been better managed. Maybe using headphones or finding a quieter spot could help. The woman's frustration seems reasonable if she felt uncomfortable.\n\nSo, considering all that, the user might be in the wrong for not considering others' comfort, even if the calls were important. The length of the calls and the volume could have been issues. But the user's situation is understandable too. It's a tough call, but leaning towards the user being at fault for not being mindful of others on a shared space.\n"
