I was on the phone for 3 hours of a 10 hour bus trip\nSome notes:\n- this bus fare was $60 for an adult and $33 for a child (me) while a plane ticket usually averages $80 but are frequentl on sale for $60. Reason why I chose to take a bus is because I paid for the trip and I don\u2019t get paid very much from work to afford the luxury to fly just as yet.\n\n- I\u2019m 17 years old and this lady seems like she\u2019s 35-45 years old (in other words she might seem like she has some sort of authority over me because I\u2019m young and she\u2019s older)\n\n- I am travelling by myself\n\n\nSo picture this: monday morning at 9:15am 2/3rds of a bus gets filled with people to drive from Melbourne to Adelaide (~800km/500mi). I\u2019m on this bus trip for two main reasons: I have a car in Adelaide that I need to drive back to Melbourne and I also haven\u2019t seen my dad in 4 months aswell (he\u2019s the one who helped me buy the car aswell).\n\nNow up until this point, I have been trying to get in contact with my dad so I can plan this little mini-holiday and how everything will work from registering the car to discussing and fixing all the problems with the car (its an old car).  Notice how I said I was \u2018trying\u2019 to get in contact with my dad - being that he\u2019d lost his phone and hasn\u2019t been able to call me (didn\u2019t know my phone number).\nNow this was all until I called my grandparents who live in the same city as my dad. As it turned out, my father went to his parents house to use their phone to call me, right as I was about to call him. So fair enough, I was on the phone with my dad and we talked.\n\nSoon enough, we\u2019d planned our week ahead and eventually got onto other personal topics because we don\u2019t really call very often. By the time I say goodbye, it was about 11:35am. I was tired from the night before and try to get some rest.\n\nNo more than 15 minutes later, I get a call from my best friend. She was calling to tell me about how she and her parents got into a massive argument over the holiday we\u2019re going on in 9 days. To celebrate our passing of highschool, its tradition for students to go on a holiday somwhere in groups with the main intention to get as drunk as physically possible.\n\nWell, her parents had said that they didn\u2019t want her to go, although we\u2019ve all already paid $1000+ and booked it 6 months ago. Plans were SET, and we were ready to leave. So naturally I spent the next 45 minutes discussing what our course of action was to get around this situation.\n\nNo less than 5 minutes before I\u2019m saying bye to my friend on the phone, this lady sitting on the other side of the aisle to me raises her voice at me saying \n\n\u201care you going to stay on that fucking phone for the whole trip? You\u2019re being so rude!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm hello? How am I rude? I\u2019m talking to my friend and its only 12:30pm. That means daytime. That means people wont be sleeping\u201d\n\nNow I know that there may be some people asleep on the bus. I should know, I almost had a nap before my friend called me. But I\u2019m not sure how I was rude. If you didn\u2019t want this, then you should have flown and not caught a bus.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being on the phone for three hours during a 10-hour bus ride. The situation involves a 17-year-old traveling alone, using a cheaper bus ticket because they can't afford a plane. They were talking to their dad first, then their best friend about a holiday.\n\nThe key points here are the context and the actions taken. The author was trying to connect with their dad, which is understandable, especially since they hadn't seen him in four months. Then, the friend's call was about a serious issue regarding a planned trip, which they had already paid for. The argument with the friend's parents is a significant matter to discuss.\n\nThe lady on the bus called out the author for being rude. But buses can be noisy, and phone calls are common. However, the time of the call (midday) might mean fewer people are asleep. The author also points out that the lady could have chosen a plane if she wanted more peace. But maybe she didn't want the cost. \n\nIs the author wrong? It's a judgment call. While talking on a phone on a bus isn't inherently wrong, maybe the volume or duration was an issue. The author didn't mention using headphones or keeping the volume down, which could have been considerate. However, the situation involved personal and urgent matters. The friend's issue was important, so the discussion might have been necessary. \n\nBut some might argue that even if the topics were important, the volume or the presence of others matters. However, the author didn't do anything illegal or against the bus's rules. The lady's reaction is a personal opinion. So, the answer would depend on whether the author's actions were reasonably considerate. Since they didn't mention loudness, maybe not. The friend's call lasted 45 minutes, which is a bit long, but the context is important. \n\nIn the end, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They had valid reasons for the calls, and the lady's complaint is subjective. So the answer is B.\n"
