I was on the phone for 3 hours of a 10 hour bus trip\nSome notes:\n- this bus fare was $60 for an adult and $33 for a child (me) while a plane ticket usually averages $80 but are frequentl on sale for $60. Reason why I chose to take a bus is because I paid for the trip and I don\u2019t get paid very much from work to afford the luxury to fly just as yet.\n\n- I\u2019m 17 years old and this lady seems like she\u2019s 35-45 years old (in other words she might seem like she has some sort of authority over me because I\u2019m young and she\u2019s older)\n\n- I am travelling by myself\n\n\nSo picture this: monday morning at 9:15am 2/3rds of a bus gets filled with people to drive from Melbourne to Adelaide (~800km/500mi). I\u2019m on this bus trip for two main reasons: I have a car in Adelaide that I need to drive back to Melbourne and I also haven\u2019t seen my dad in 4 months aswell (he\u2019s the one who helped me buy the car aswell).\n\nNow up until this point, I have been trying to get in contact with my dad so I can plan this little mini-holiday and how everything will work from registering the car to discussing and fixing all the problems with the car (its an old car).  Notice how I said I was \u2018trying\u2019 to get in contact with my dad - being that he\u2019d lost his phone and hasn\u2019t been able to call me (didn\u2019t know my phone number).\nNow this was all until I called my grandparents who live in the same city as my dad. As it turned out, my father went to his parents house to use their phone to call me, right as I was about to call him. So fair enough, I was on the phone with my dad and we talked.\n\nSoon enough, we\u2019d planned our week ahead and eventually got onto other personal topics because we don\u2019t really call very often. By the time I say goodbye, it was about 11:35am. I was tired from the night before and try to get some rest.\n\nNo more than 15 minutes later, I get a call from my best friend. She was calling to tell me about how she and her parents got into a massive argument over the holiday we\u2019re going on in 9 days. To celebrate our passing of highschool, its tradition for students to go on a holiday somwhere in groups with the main intention to get as drunk as physically possible.\n\nWell, her parents had said that they didn\u2019t want her to go, although we\u2019ve all already paid $1000+ and booked it 6 months ago. Plans were SET, and we were ready to leave. So naturally I spent the next 45 minutes discussing what our course of action was to get around this situation.\n\nNo less than 5 minutes before I\u2019m saying bye to my friend on the phone, this lady sitting on the other side of the aisle to me raises her voice at me saying \n\n\u201care you going to stay on that fucking phone for the whole trip? You\u2019re being so rude!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm hello? How am I rude? I\u2019m talking to my friend and its only 12:30pm. That means daytime. That means people wont be sleeping\u201d\n\nNow I know that there may be some people asleep on the bus. I should know, I almost had a nap before my friend called me. But I\u2019m not sure how I was rude. If you didn\u2019t want this, then you should have flown and not caught a bus.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a 17-year-old taking a bus trip alone, using their phone for three hours out of ten hours. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The person is 17, traveling alone, which might make others view them as needing more consideration or maybe even see them as a child. The bus is a long trip, and they were on the phone for a significant portion of it. The main points are the two calls: one with their dad and another with their best friend.\n\nThe person argues that using the phone during the day isn't rude because people aren't sleeping. But the lady who complained might have been disturbed or uncomfortable. The person mentions that they were on the phone with their dad discussing important matters\u2014like car registration and fixing the car, which are practical and necessary. Then the call with the friend was about a planned trip that's already booked, so that's also important to them.\n\nHowever, bus etiquette usually suggests using earphones if talking on the phone, especially to avoid disturbing others. Even during the day, some people might want quiet, especially on a long trip. The author didn't mention using headphones, so others might have been hearing the conversation. The lady's outburst could be because of the volume or the duration. \n\nThe author's defense is that if the lady didn't want to hear phone calls, she should have taken a flight. But flights are more expensive, and the author chose the bus for cost reasons. That might not be a valid argument for being disruptive. \n\nAlso, the author was talking to their friend about a sensitive issue\u2014parents not allowing them to go on a trip. That's a personal matter, but it's still a phone call that others might find intrusive. \n\nIn terms of age, being 17, the author might not have full awareness of appropriate social norms in public spaces. The lady is older, which might have played into her feeling authoritative. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author might have been inconsiderate even if the calls were important. Not using headphones and talking loudly could be seen as rude. Even though the conversations were necessary, the manner in which they were conducted (without headphones, during a long trip where people expect some quiet) might make the author at fault. \n\nBut maybe the lady overreacted. The author was on the phone for three hours out of ten, which isn't the entire trip. However, the lady's comment is confrontational, which isn't great either. \n\nBut the key is whether the author was wrong. The answer hinges on whether using the phone without headphones and for that duration is considered rude. Since the author didn't mention headphones, and the lady's complaint was about being rude, it's possible the author was inconsiderate. So the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
