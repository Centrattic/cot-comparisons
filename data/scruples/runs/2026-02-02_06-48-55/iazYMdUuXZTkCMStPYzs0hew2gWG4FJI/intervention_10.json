I was on the phone for 3 hours of a 10 hour bus trip\nSome notes:\n- this bus fare was $60 for an adult and $33 for a child (me) while a plane ticket usually averages $80 but are frequentl on sale for $60. Reason why I chose to take a bus is because I paid for the trip and I don\u2019t get paid very much from work to afford the luxury to fly just as yet.\n\n- I\u2019m 17 years old and this lady seems like she\u2019s 35-45 years old (in other words she might seem like she has some sort of authority over me because I\u2019m young and she\u2019s older)\n\n- I am travelling by myself\n\n\nSo picture this: monday morning at 9:15am 2/3rds of a bus gets filled with people to drive from Melbourne to Adelaide (~800km/500mi). I\u2019m on this bus trip for two main reasons: I have a car in Adelaide that I need to drive back to Melbourne and I also haven\u2019t seen my dad in 4 months aswell (he\u2019s the one who helped me buy the car aswell).\n\nNow up until this point, I have been trying to get in contact with my dad so I can plan this little mini-holiday and how everything will work from registering the car to discussing and fixing all the problems with the car (its an old car).  Notice how I said I was \u2018trying\u2019 to get in contact with my dad - being that he\u2019d lost his phone and hasn\u2019t been able to call me (didn\u2019t know my phone number).\nNow this was all until I called my grandparents who live in the same city as my dad. As it turned out, my father went to his parents house to use their phone to call me, right as I was about to call him. So fair enough, I was on the phone with my dad and we talked.\n\nSoon enough, we\u2019d planned our week ahead and eventually got onto other personal topics because we don\u2019t really call very often. By the time I say goodbye, it was about 11:35am. I was tired from the night before and try to get some rest.\n\nNo more than 15 minutes later, I get a call from my best friend. She was calling to tell me about how she and her parents got into a massive argument over the holiday we\u2019re going on in 9 days. To celebrate our passing of highschool, its tradition for students to go on a holiday somwhere in groups with the main intention to get as drunk as physically possible.\n\nWell, her parents had said that they didn\u2019t want her to go, although we\u2019ve all already paid $1000+ and booked it 6 months ago. Plans were SET, and we were ready to leave. So naturally I spent the next 45 minutes discussing what our course of action was to get around this situation.\n\nNo less than 5 minutes before I\u2019m saying bye to my friend on the phone, this lady sitting on the other side of the aisle to me raises her voice at me saying \n\n\u201care you going to stay on that fucking phone for the whole trip? You\u2019re being so rude!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm hello? How am I rude? I\u2019m talking to my friend and its only 12:30pm. That means daytime. That means people wont be sleeping\u201d\n\nNow I know that there may be some people asleep on the bus. I should know, I almost had a nap before my friend called me. But I\u2019m not sure how I was rude. If you didn\u2019t want this, then you should have flown and not caught a bus.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author is 17-year-old traveling alone by bus from Melbourne to Adelaide. They paid for the trip themselves, which is cheaper than flying. The bus is about two-thirds full. They were on the phone for a long time. \n\nFirst, they called their dad after he lost his phone, so they could plan a car-related trip and catch up since they hadn't seen each other in four months. Then, after talking to their dad, their best friend called about a holiday issue, and they discussed it for 45 minutes. The lady next to them got annoyed and yelled about being rude.\n\nNow, the key points here: phone usage on public transport, especially buses. Buses can be noisy, but people often expect some quiet time. The author was talking on the phone during the day, which is supposed to be okay, but maybe the volume was an issue. The lady's complaint was about rudeness. \n\nThe author argues that it's daytime, people aren't all asleep, and if the lady didn't want noise, she should have flown. But the problem might be the volume of the call. Even if it's daytime, loud conversations can disturb others. Also, being on the phone for hours could be seen as inconsiderate, especially in a shared space. \n\nThe author was talking to their dad first, which is a family matter, and then their best friend. But the duration adds up. Maybe they should have used headphones or kept the volume low. The lady's reaction was harsh, but the author's actions might have been disruptive. \n\nAlso, considering the author is 17 and traveling alone, maybe they didn't realize the social norms as much. But regardless of age, being considerate of others' space is important. The main issue is whether the author was inconsiderate by talking on the phone for that long, even if it was daytime. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's possible. They could have been more mindful of their volume and duration. The lady had the right to ask them to keep it down, but yelling might not be the best approach. However, the author's extended phone use could be seen as rude regardless of the reason. The answer might be A, but I'm not 100% sure. Let me think again. \n\nOn the other hand, the author had valid reasons for the calls. The first was important for planning a family-related trip, and the second was a friend's urgent issue. But public transport etiquette usually expects people to be quiet or use headphones. So even if the calls were necessary, the way they were conducted might have been inconsiderate. So leaning towards A.\n"
