I was on the phone for 3 hours of a 10 hour bus trip\nSome notes:\n- this bus fare was $60 for an adult and $33 for a child (me) while a plane ticket usually averages $80 but are frequentl on sale for $60. Reason why I chose to take a bus is because I paid for the trip and I don\u2019t get paid very much from work to afford the luxury to fly just as yet.\n\n- I\u2019m 17 years old and this lady seems like she\u2019s 35-45 years old (in other words she might seem like she has some sort of authority over me because I\u2019m young and she\u2019s older)\n\n- I am travelling by myself\n\n\nSo picture this: monday morning at 9:15am 2/3rds of a bus gets filled with people to drive from Melbourne to Adelaide (~800km/500mi). I\u2019m on this bus trip for two main reasons: I have a car in Adelaide that I need to drive back to Melbourne and I also haven\u2019t seen my dad in 4 months aswell (he\u2019s the one who helped me buy the car aswell).\n\nNow up until this point, I have been trying to get in contact with my dad so I can plan this little mini-holiday and how everything will work from registering the car to discussing and fixing all the problems with the car (its an old car).  Notice how I said I was \u2018trying\u2019 to get in contact with my dad - being that he\u2019d lost his phone and hasn\u2019t been able to call me (didn\u2019t know my phone number).\nNow this was all until I called my grandparents who live in the same city as my dad. As it turned out, my father went to his parents house to use their phone to call me, right as I was about to call him. So fair enough, I was on the phone with my dad and we talked.\n\nSoon enough, we\u2019d planned our week ahead and eventually got onto other personal topics because we don\u2019t really call very often. By the time I say goodbye, it was about 11:35am. I was tired from the night before and try to get some rest.\n\nNo more than 15 minutes later, I get a call from my best friend. She was calling to tell me about how she and her parents got into a massive argument over the holiday we\u2019re going on in 9 days. To celebrate our passing of highschool, its tradition for students to go on a holiday somwhere in groups with the main intention to get as drunk as physically possible.\n\nWell, her parents had said that they didn\u2019t want her to go, although we\u2019ve all already paid $1000+ and booked it 6 months ago. Plans were SET, and we were ready to leave. So naturally I spent the next 45 minutes discussing what our course of action was to get around this situation.\n\nNo less than 5 minutes before I\u2019m saying bye to my friend on the phone, this lady sitting on the other side of the aisle to me raises her voice at me saying \n\n\u201care you going to stay on that fucking phone for the whole trip? You\u2019re being so rude!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm hello? How am I rude? I\u2019m talking to my friend and its only 12:30pm. That means daytime. That means people wont be sleeping\u201d\n\nNow I know that there may be some people asleep on the bus. I should know, I almost had a nap before my friend called me. But I\u2019m not sure how I was rude. If you didn\u2019t want this, then you should have flown and not caught a bus.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being on the phone for three hours during a 10-hour bus trip. The situation involves a young person on a bus, talking to family and friends, and being criticized by an older woman.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that the bus is only two-thirds full, so maybe not as crowded as a plane where people are packed in. But even so, bus trips can be close quarters. The author is 17, traveling alone, which might make them more aware of their need for communication. They had a valid reason to call their dad after he lost his phone, and then their friend about a planned trip. The conversation with the friend was about a significant argument and pre-paid plans, which adds context.\n\nThe lady's complaint was about being rude. But the author points out that it's daytime, so maybe fewer people are sleeping. Also, they mention that if the lady didn't want noise, she should have taken a plane. However, the bus is cheaper for the author, which is a factor in their decision-making.\n\nPublic transportation etiquette often suggests being mindful of others. While it's daytime, loud phone conversations can still disturb others, even if not everyone is sleeping. The author might not have kept their voice down, but they argue they were discussing important matters. However, the length of the call (3 hours) and the content (personal, maybe loud) could contribute to the issue.\n\nOn the other hand, the woman's choice of language (\"fucking phone\") was harsh and confrontational, which isn't helpful. The author's response is defensive. The key here is whether the author was being inconsiderate. If they were on the phone for three hours without considering others, even during the day, that's rude. But if they were having necessary, albeit lengthy, conversations and couldn't help the volume, maybe not.\n\nI think the balance leans towards the author being in the wrong because, even in the morning, using a phone for that long on a shared space without considering others' comfort is inconsiderate. However, the context of their reasons (family and friend issues) adds nuance. But public transport etiquette generally expects some level of quietness. So, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong), but I can see arguments both ways. However, since the user initially thought the author is in the wrong, and considering the time on the phone, maybe A is correct.\n"
