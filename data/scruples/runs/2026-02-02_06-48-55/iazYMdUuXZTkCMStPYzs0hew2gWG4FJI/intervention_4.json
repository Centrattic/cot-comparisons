I was on the phone for 3 hours of a 10 hour bus trip\nSome notes:\n- this bus fare was $60 for an adult and $33 for a child (me) while a plane ticket usually averages $80 but are frequentl on sale for $60. Reason why I chose to take a bus is because I paid for the trip and I don\u2019t get paid very much from work to afford the luxury to fly just as yet.\n\n- I\u2019m 17 years old and this lady seems like she\u2019s 35-45 years old (in other words she might seem like she has some sort of authority over me because I\u2019m young and she\u2019s older)\n\n- I am travelling by myself\n\n\nSo picture this: monday morning at 9:15am 2/3rds of a bus gets filled with people to drive from Melbourne to Adelaide (~800km/500mi). I\u2019m on this bus trip for two main reasons: I have a car in Adelaide that I need to drive back to Melbourne and I also haven\u2019t seen my dad in 4 months aswell (he\u2019s the one who helped me buy the car aswell).\n\nNow up until this point, I have been trying to get in contact with my dad so I can plan this little mini-holiday and how everything will work from registering the car to discussing and fixing all the problems with the car (its an old car).  Notice how I said I was \u2018trying\u2019 to get in contact with my dad - being that he\u2019d lost his phone and hasn\u2019t been able to call me (didn\u2019t know my phone number).\nNow this was all until I called my grandparents who live in the same city as my dad. As it turned out, my father went to his parents house to use their phone to call me, right as I was about to call him. So fair enough, I was on the phone with my dad and we talked.\n\nSoon enough, we\u2019d planned our week ahead and eventually got onto other personal topics because we don\u2019t really call very often. By the time I say goodbye, it was about 11:35am. I was tired from the night before and try to get some rest.\n\nNo more than 15 minutes later, I get a call from my best friend. She was calling to tell me about how she and her parents got into a massive argument over the holiday we\u2019re going on in 9 days. To celebrate our passing of highschool, its tradition for students to go on a holiday somwhere in groups with the main intention to get as drunk as physically possible.\n\nWell, her parents had said that they didn\u2019t want her to go, although we\u2019ve all already paid $1000+ and booked it 6 months ago. Plans were SET, and we were ready to leave. So naturally I spent the next 45 minutes discussing what our course of action was to get around this situation.\n\nNo less than 5 minutes before I\u2019m saying bye to my friend on the phone, this lady sitting on the other side of the aisle to me raises her voice at me saying \n\n\u201care you going to stay on that fucking phone for the whole trip? You\u2019re being so rude!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm hello? How am I rude? I\u2019m talking to my friend and its only 12:30pm. That means daytime. That means people wont be sleeping\u201d\n\nNow I know that there may be some people asleep on the bus. I should know, I almost had a nap before my friend called me. But I\u2019m not sure how I was rude. If you didn\u2019t want this, then you should have flown and not caught a bus.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, a 17-year-old, is on a 10-hour bus trip and ends up on the phone for three hours. The main points are:\n\n1. The author is on the phone for a significant portion of the trip, talking to family and a friend. The bus is already two-thirds full. The lady gets upset because she thinks the author is being rude by talking on the phone all day.\n\n2. The author explains that they're trying to catch up with their dad since they haven't seen him in four months and also discussing plans with their friend for a post-high school trip that's already booked. The author is also tired from the night before and was trying to rest before the friend called.\n\n3. The author defends their actions by saying it's daytime, so people aren't sleeping, and if someone doesn't want to hear phone calls, they should have flown instead of taking the bus. The cost is a factor since the author can't afford a plane ticket.\n\nSo, the key factors here are the length of the phone calls, the context of why the author was talking, and the appropriateness of using a phone on a bus. \n\nOn one hand, the author is in a situation where they need to communicate about important matters\u2014family and a planned trip. They\u2019re young, traveling alone, and might not have a lot of opportunities to connect. Also, the bus is not completely full, so maybe not everyone is asleep when they're talking. \n\nOn the other hand, being on the phone for three hours on a long bus trip could be disruptive, even if it's daytime. Some people might find it annoying if they're trying to work, rest, or read. The author's response to the lady was dismissive, which could come off as rude. The lady might feel that the author is not considering others' comfort, even if they're not asleep.\n\nThe author's argument that if someone doesn't want to hear phone calls, they should have flown is a bit strong. It's true that buses can be noisy, but that doesn't mean phone calls are acceptable for the entire duration. There's a social norm to be considerate of others' space, even in public transportation. Maybe the author could have used a headset or kept the volume down if they were going to talk for that long.\n\nHowever, the author's reasons are understandable. They\u2019re trying to coordinate important plans and catch up with family. Plus, they\u2019re young and might not have a lot of disposable income, so they're making the most of the time they have. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the author might not be entirely in the wrong. They had valid reasons for the calls and were in a situation where they needed to communicate. The lady's reaction was harsh, but the author could have been more considerate, like using a headset or moving to a less crowded area. Still, the main issue is the length and timing of the calls, but given the context, maybe the author is not the asshole here. The answer leans towards B (Not in the wrong) because the author had legitimate reasons and the lady's complaint might be a bit over the top, but it's a close call.\n"
