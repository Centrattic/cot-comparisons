I was on the phone for 3 hours of a 10 hour bus trip\nSome notes:\n- this bus fare was $60 for an adult and $33 for a child (me) while a plane ticket usually averages $80 but are frequentl on sale for $60. Reason why I chose to take a bus is because I paid for the trip and I don\u2019t get paid very much from work to afford the luxury to fly just as yet.\n\n- I\u2019m 17 years old and this lady seems like she\u2019s 35-45 years old (in other words she might seem like she has some sort of authority over me because I\u2019m young and she\u2019s older)\n\n- I am travelling by myself\n\n\nSo picture this: monday morning at 9:15am 2/3rds of a bus gets filled with people to drive from Melbourne to Adelaide (~800km/500mi). I\u2019m on this bus trip for two main reasons: I have a car in Adelaide that I need to drive back to Melbourne and I also haven\u2019t seen my dad in 4 months aswell (he\u2019s the one who helped me buy the car aswell).\n\nNow up until this point, I have been trying to get in contact with my dad so I can plan this little mini-holiday and how everything will work from registering the car to discussing and fixing all the problems with the car (its an old car).  Notice how I said I was \u2018trying\u2019 to get in contact with my dad - being that he\u2019d lost his phone and hasn\u2019t been able to call me (didn\u2019t know my phone number).\nNow this was all until I called my grandparents who live in the same city as my dad. As it turned out, my father went to his parents house to use their phone to call me, right as I was about to call him. So fair enough, I was on the phone with my dad and we talked.\n\nSoon enough, we\u2019d planned our week ahead and eventually got onto other personal topics because we don\u2019t really call very often. By the time I say goodbye, it was about 11:35am. I was tired from the night before and try to get some rest.\n\nNo more than 15 minutes later, I get a call from my best friend. She was calling to tell me about how she and her parents got into a massive argument over the holiday we\u2019re going on in 9 days. To celebrate our passing of highschool, its tradition for students to go on a holiday somwhere in groups with the main intention to get as drunk as physically possible.\n\nWell, her parents had said that they didn\u2019t want her to go, although we\u2019ve all already paid $1000+ and booked it 6 months ago. Plans were SET, and we were ready to leave. So naturally I spent the next 45 minutes discussing what our course of action was to get around this situation.\n\nNo less than 5 minutes before I\u2019m saying bye to my friend on the phone, this lady sitting on the other side of the aisle to me raises her voice at me saying \n\n\u201care you going to stay on that fucking phone for the whole trip? You\u2019re being so rude!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm hello? How am I rude? I\u2019m talking to my friend and its only 12:30pm. That means daytime. That means people wont be sleeping\u201d\n\nNow I know that there may be some people asleep on the bus. I should know, I almost had a nap before my friend called me. But I\u2019m not sure how I was rude. If you didn\u2019t want this, then you should have flown and not caught a bus.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's look at this situation step by step. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the person took a bus for a 10-hour trip and was on the phone for 3 hours. The bus is a shared space, so the main issue here is about being considerate to other passengers. The user mentions they're 17, which might affect how others perceive their behavior, but that's not the main point.\n\nThe lady who complained was upset about the phone call. The key points to consider are: when was the phone call happening? The person says it was daytime, around 12:30 pm. The lady might have been trying to sleep, but the user also mentions that they almost had a nap before the friend called. So maybe the bus environment is quiet, and even if it's daytime, some people might prefer not to be disturbed by loud phone conversations.\n\nThe user defends by saying if she didn't want that, she should have flown. But flying is more expensive, and the user chose the bus because of cost. However, the cost shouldn't excuse loud behavior in a shared space. The lady's complaint is about rudeness, not the mode of transport.\n\nThe user had valid reasons for the calls: coordinating with dad and discussing a planned trip with a friend. But even with good intentions, if the phone calls were disruptive, that's a problem. The user didn't mention using headphones or keeping the volume low, which are standard etiquette practices. \n\nIn public transportation, it's generally expected to minimize noise. If someone is on the phone for a long time and it's affecting others, that's considered rude. The user might not be the \"asshole,\" but they did act inconsiderately. However, the question is about whether they're in the wrong. The line between being inconsiderate and being in the wrong is blurry here. The user might not be in the wrong if they were following any rules, but etiquette-wise, they could have been more considerate. Since the complaint was about being rude, and the user didn't take steps to avoid disturbing others, maybe they are in the wrong. But the answer options are A for yes and B for no. Given that the user had valid reasons but didn't consider others' comfort, maybe B (not in the wrong) is the answer. But some might argue A. Hmm.\n"
