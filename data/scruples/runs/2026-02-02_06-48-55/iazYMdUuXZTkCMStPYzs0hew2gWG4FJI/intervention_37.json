I was on the phone for 3 hours of a 10 hour bus trip\nSome notes:\n- this bus fare was $60 for an adult and $33 for a child (me) while a plane ticket usually averages $80 but are frequentl on sale for $60. Reason why I chose to take a bus is because I paid for the trip and I don\u2019t get paid very much from work to afford the luxury to fly just as yet.\n\n- I\u2019m 17 years old and this lady seems like she\u2019s 35-45 years old (in other words she might seem like she has some sort of authority over me because I\u2019m young and she\u2019s older)\n\n- I am travelling by myself\n\n\nSo picture this: monday morning at 9:15am 2/3rds of a bus gets filled with people to drive from Melbourne to Adelaide (~800km/500mi). I\u2019m on this bus trip for two main reasons: I have a car in Adelaide that I need to drive back to Melbourne and I also haven\u2019t seen my dad in 4 months aswell (he\u2019s the one who helped me buy the car aswell).\n\nNow up until this point, I have been trying to get in contact with my dad so I can plan this little mini-holiday and how everything will work from registering the car to discussing and fixing all the problems with the car (its an old car).  Notice how I said I was \u2018trying\u2019 to get in contact with my dad - being that he\u2019d lost his phone and hasn\u2019t been able to call me (didn\u2019t know my phone number).\nNow this was all until I called my grandparents who live in the same city as my dad. As it turned out, my father went to his parents house to use their phone to call me, right as I was about to call him. So fair enough, I was on the phone with my dad and we talked.\n\nSoon enough, we\u2019d planned our week ahead and eventually got onto other personal topics because we don\u2019t really call very often. By the time I say goodbye, it was about 11:35am. I was tired from the night before and try to get some rest.\n\nNo more than 15 minutes later, I get a call from my best friend. She was calling to tell me about how she and her parents got into a massive argument over the holiday we\u2019re going on in 9 days. To celebrate our passing of highschool, its tradition for students to go on a holiday somwhere in groups with the main intention to get as drunk as physically possible.\n\nWell, her parents had said that they didn\u2019t want her to go, although we\u2019ve all already paid $1000+ and booked it 6 months ago. Plans were SET, and we were ready to leave. So naturally I spent the next 45 minutes discussing what our course of action was to get around this situation.\n\nNo less than 5 minutes before I\u2019m saying bye to my friend on the phone, this lady sitting on the other side of the aisle to me raises her voice at me saying \n\n\u201care you going to stay on that fucking phone for the whole trip? You\u2019re being so rude!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm hello? How am I rude? I\u2019m talking to my friend and its only 12:30pm. That means daytime. That means people wont be sleeping\u201d\n\nNow I know that there may be some people asleep on the bus. I should know, I almost had a nap before my friend called me. But I\u2019m not sure how I was rude. If you didn\u2019t want this, then you should have flown and not caught a bus.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The person was on the phone for 3 hours during a 10-hour bus trip. Let me look at the details again.\n\nFirst, the context: the person is 17, traveling alone, chose the bus because it's cheaper than a plane. They had a legitimate reason to call their dad after not seeing him in 4 months, and then their friend called about a holiday trip they had already planned and paid for. The lady complained about the phone use, saying it was rude. The person defended themselves by saying it's daytime, so people shouldn't be sleeping, and if they didn't want that, they should have flown.\n\nNow, the key points here. The person was on the phone for a significant portion of the trip, but the reasons given are personal and important. They weren't in a meeting or something work-related. However, bus trips are typically quieter, and even if it's daytime, some people might be trying to work, read, or rest. Using a phone on speaker or at a loud volume can be disruptive. But the person was just talking on the phone normally, not on speaker. However, even regular phone conversations can be a distraction, especially on a packed bus. \n\nThe age dynamic might play a role here. The person is 17 and the lady is in her late 30s to mid-40s. Sometimes, people might assume that younger individuals are more inconsiderate, but that's a stereotype. The person's actions are justified by their legitimate needs to communicate with family and friends. But public etiquette often expects people to be mindful of their surroundings. \n\nAnother angle: the person was using a bus as a cheaper option, which is reasonable given their financial situation. But when you choose a bus, you're in a shared space where noise can affect others. Even if the person is talking during the day, if others are trying to do things that require concentration or quiet, the phone calls can still be an issue. \n\nThe person's response to the complaint was defensive and a bit snarky (\"if you didn't want this, then you should have flown\"). That's probably not the best way to handle it, but it's a common reaction when people feel their actions are justified. The lady raised her voice, which was rude, but the person's response didn't help either.\n\nConsidering all this, while the person has valid reasons for being on the phone, the fact that they were using it for an extended period in a shared space without considering the comfort of others could be seen as inconsiderate. However, their intentions were good, and they weren't causing harm beyond some possible noise. It's a judgment call between the necessity of their communication and the shared responsibility of a public transport environment. \n\nI think the answer is A (Yes), but I'm on the fence. The person might be in the wrong because of the duration and the inconsiderate response, but their reasons are understandable. However, the community might split here. Alternatively, the lady is just being overly sensitive. But in public transport etiquette, even talking on the phone is discouraged unless it's a short call. So maybe the person was inconsiderate, making them the asshole. So, A.\n"
