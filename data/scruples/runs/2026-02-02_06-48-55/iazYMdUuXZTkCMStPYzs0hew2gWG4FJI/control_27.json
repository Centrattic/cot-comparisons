I was on the phone for 3 hours of a 10 hour bus trip\nSome notes:\n- this bus fare was $60 for an adult and $33 for a child (me) while a plane ticket usually averages $80 but are frequentl on sale for $60. Reason why I chose to take a bus is because I paid for the trip and I don\u2019t get paid very much from work to afford the luxury to fly just as yet.\n\n- I\u2019m 17 years old and this lady seems like she\u2019s 35-45 years old (in other words she might seem like she has some sort of authority over me because I\u2019m young and she\u2019s older)\n\n- I am travelling by myself\n\n\nSo picture this: monday morning at 9:15am 2/3rds of a bus gets filled with people to drive from Melbourne to Adelaide (~800km/500mi). I\u2019m on this bus trip for two main reasons: I have a car in Adelaide that I need to drive back to Melbourne and I also haven\u2019t seen my dad in 4 months aswell (he\u2019s the one who helped me buy the car aswell).\n\nNow up until this point, I have been trying to get in contact with my dad so I can plan this little mini-holiday and how everything will work from registering the car to discussing and fixing all the problems with the car (its an old car).  Notice how I said I was \u2018trying\u2019 to get in contact with my dad - being that he\u2019d lost his phone and hasn\u2019t been able to call me (didn\u2019t know my phone number).\nNow this was all until I called my grandparents who live in the same city as my dad. As it turned out, my father went to his parents house to use their phone to call me, right as I was about to call him. So fair enough, I was on the phone with my dad and we talked.\n\nSoon enough, we\u2019d planned our week ahead and eventually got onto other personal topics because we don\u2019t really call very often. By the time I say goodbye, it was about 11:35am. I was tired from the night before and try to get some rest.\n\nNo more than 15 minutes later, I get a call from my best friend. She was calling to tell me about how she and her parents got into a massive argument over the holiday we\u2019re going on in 9 days. To celebrate our passing of highschool, its tradition for students to go on a holiday somwhere in groups with the main intention to get as drunk as physically possible.\n\nWell, her parents had said that they didn\u2019t want her to go, although we\u2019ve all already paid $1000+ and booked it 6 months ago. Plans were SET, and we were ready to leave. So naturally I spent the next 45 minutes discussing what our course of action was to get around this situation.\n\nNo less than 5 minutes before I\u2019m saying bye to my friend on the phone, this lady sitting on the other side of the aisle to me raises her voice at me saying \n\n\u201care you going to stay on that fucking phone for the whole trip? You\u2019re being so rude!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm hello? How am I rude? I\u2019m talking to my friend and its only 12:30pm. That means daytime. That means people wont be sleeping\u201d\n\nNow I know that there may be some people asleep on the bus. I should know, I almost had a nap before my friend called me. But I\u2019m not sure how I was rude. If you didn\u2019t want this, then you should have flown and not caught a bus.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The scenario involves a 17-year-old taking a long bus trip and using the phone extensively, leading to a confrontation with another passenger. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author chose the bus because it's cheaper than a plane, which is understandable given their financial situation. They're traveling alone, which adds to the complexity. The phone calls were for important reasons: coordinating with their dad about a car and discussing a holiday with a friend. \n\nThe key issue is the other passenger's complaint about the phone use. The author argues that it's daytime, and they were on the phone for a reasonable time. However, in shared spaces like buses, there's an unspoken expectation of being considerate of others. Even if it's daytime, loud phone conversations can be disruptive. The author mentions using \"speakerphone\" but doesn't clarify if they were on speaker or holding the phone to their ear. If they were talking normally, others might find it intrusive.\n\nAlso, the author's response to the lady's comment might have come off as defensive or dismissive. Saying \"If you didn\u2019t want this, then you should have flown and not caught a bus\" is a bit of an argumentative stance, which could escalate the situation. \n\nBut then again, the phone calls were for legitimate reasons, and the author wasn't necessarily violating any rules. Buses don't always have strict policies against phone use, so it's more a matter of social etiquette. The length of the calls might be excessive, but the reasons could justify it. \n\nThe age difference might play a role too. The author is young and perhaps less aware of social norms in such settings. The lady might have felt justified in calling out what she saw as inconsiderate behavior. \n\nSo, balancing both sides: On one hand, the author has good reasons for the calls. On the other, their phone use could have been disruptive. The response to the lady wasn't ideal but not necessarily wrong. The main question is whether they were inconsiderate, which is subjective. Given that the lady complained and the author's use might have been loud or long, there's a case that the author could have been more mindful. However, the situation is nuanced, and the answer might depend on cultural norms and specific circumstances not fully detailed here. But overall, the author might not be entirely in the wrong since their phone use was for important matters and the setting allows for such use unless rules are explicitly against it.\n"
