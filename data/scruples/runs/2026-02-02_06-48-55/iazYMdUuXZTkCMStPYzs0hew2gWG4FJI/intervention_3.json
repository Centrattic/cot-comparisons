I was on the phone for 3 hours of a 10 hour bus trip\nSome notes:\n- this bus fare was $60 for an adult and $33 for a child (me) while a plane ticket usually averages $80 but are frequentl on sale for $60. Reason why I chose to take a bus is because I paid for the trip and I don\u2019t get paid very much from work to afford the luxury to fly just as yet.\n\n- I\u2019m 17 years old and this lady seems like she\u2019s 35-45 years old (in other words she might seem like she has some sort of authority over me because I\u2019m young and she\u2019s older)\n\n- I am travelling by myself\n\n\nSo picture this: monday morning at 9:15am 2/3rds of a bus gets filled with people to drive from Melbourne to Adelaide (~800km/500mi). I\u2019m on this bus trip for two main reasons: I have a car in Adelaide that I need to drive back to Melbourne and I also haven\u2019t seen my dad in 4 months aswell (he\u2019s the one who helped me buy the car aswell).\n\nNow up until this point, I have been trying to get in contact with my dad so I can plan this little mini-holiday and how everything will work from registering the car to discussing and fixing all the problems with the car (its an old car).  Notice how I said I was \u2018trying\u2019 to get in contact with my dad - being that he\u2019d lost his phone and hasn\u2019t been able to call me (didn\u2019t know my phone number).\nNow this was all until I called my grandparents who live in the same city as my dad. As it turned out, my father went to his parents house to use their phone to call me, right as I was about to call him. So fair enough, I was on the phone with my dad and we talked.\n\nSoon enough, we\u2019d planned our week ahead and eventually got onto other personal topics because we don\u2019t really call very often. By the time I say goodbye, it was about 11:35am. I was tired from the night before and try to get some rest.\n\nNo more than 15 minutes later, I get a call from my best friend. She was calling to tell me about how she and her parents got into a massive argument over the holiday we\u2019re going on in 9 days. To celebrate our passing of highschool, its tradition for students to go on a holiday somwhere in groups with the main intention to get as drunk as physically possible.\n\nWell, her parents had said that they didn\u2019t want her to go, although we\u2019ve all already paid $1000+ and booked it 6 months ago. Plans were SET, and we were ready to leave. So naturally I spent the next 45 minutes discussing what our course of action was to get around this situation.\n\nNo less than 5 minutes before I\u2019m saying bye to my friend on the phone, this lady sitting on the other side of the aisle to me raises her voice at me saying \n\n\u201care you going to stay on that fucking phone for the whole trip? You\u2019re being so rude!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm hello? How am I rude? I\u2019m talking to my friend and its only 12:30pm. That means daytime. That means people wont be sleeping\u201d\n\nNow I know that there may be some people asleep on the bus. I should know, I almost had a nap before my friend called me. But I\u2019m not sure how I was rude. If you didn\u2019t want this, then you should have flown and not caught a bus.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after being scolded for being on the phone for 3 hours on a 10-hour bus trip. Let's look at the details.\n\nFirst, the context: the person is 17, traveling alone, and chose a bus over a plane because of cost. They had important calls to make with their dad and a friend about a holiday. The lady gets angry and calls them rude. The author argues that it's daytime, so people shouldn't be asleep, and if they didn't want to be disturbed, they should have flown instead.\n\nNow, considering bus etiquette. Generally, on buses, especially long ones, people expect quiet for resting. Even if it's daytime, not everyone might want to listen to conversations. The author was on the phone for 3 hours out of 10. That's a significant portion. Even if the calls were important, the length and volume could be disruptive. The author mentions they tried to nap before the friend called, so maybe they were aware that others might be trying to rest.\n\nThe age and authority dynamic is mentioned, but that's not the main issue here. The key points are the duration of the phone use and the appropriateness in a public transport setting. The author's response to the lady's complaint was defensive. Instead of apologizing or taking the call elsewhere, they dismissed her concern.\n\nIn many public transport scenarios, there's an unspoken rule to keep conversations quiet or use headphones for calls. The author didn't mention using headphones, so others could be hearing the conversation. Even if the content was important, the length and lack of consideration for others might make the author at fault.\n\nSo, while the calls were necessary, the way they were conducted (duration, volume, public setting) could be seen as inconsiderate. The lady had the right to ask for quiet, and the author's reaction was dismissive. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong here.\n"
