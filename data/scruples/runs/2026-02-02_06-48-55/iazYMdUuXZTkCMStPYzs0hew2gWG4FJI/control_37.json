I was on the phone for 3 hours of a 10 hour bus trip\nSome notes:\n- this bus fare was $60 for an adult and $33 for a child (me) while a plane ticket usually averages $80 but are frequentl on sale for $60. Reason why I chose to take a bus is because I paid for the trip and I don\u2019t get paid very much from work to afford the luxury to fly just as yet.\n\n- I\u2019m 17 years old and this lady seems like she\u2019s 35-45 years old (in other words she might seem like she has some sort of authority over me because I\u2019m young and she\u2019s older)\n\n- I am travelling by myself\n\n\nSo picture this: monday morning at 9:15am 2/3rds of a bus gets filled with people to drive from Melbourne to Adelaide (~800km/500mi). I\u2019m on this bus trip for two main reasons: I have a car in Adelaide that I need to drive back to Melbourne and I also haven\u2019t seen my dad in 4 months aswell (he\u2019s the one who helped me buy the car aswell).\n\nNow up until this point, I have been trying to get in contact with my dad so I can plan this little mini-holiday and how everything will work from registering the car to discussing and fixing all the problems with the car (its an old car).  Notice how I said I was \u2018trying\u2019 to get in contact with my dad - being that he\u2019d lost his phone and hasn\u2019t been able to call me (didn\u2019t know my phone number).\nNow this was all until I called my grandparents who live in the same city as my dad. As it turned out, my father went to his parents house to use their phone to call me, right as I was about to call him. So fair enough, I was on the phone with my dad and we talked.\n\nSoon enough, we\u2019d planned our week ahead and eventually got onto other personal topics because we don\u2019t really call very often. By the time I say goodbye, it was about 11:35am. I was tired from the night before and try to get some rest.\n\nNo more than 15 minutes later, I get a call from my best friend. She was calling to tell me about how she and her parents got into a massive argument over the holiday we\u2019re going on in 9 days. To celebrate our passing of highschool, its tradition for students to go on a holiday somwhere in groups with the main intention to get as drunk as physically possible.\n\nWell, her parents had said that they didn\u2019t want her to go, although we\u2019ve all already paid $1000+ and booked it 6 months ago. Plans were SET, and we were ready to leave. So naturally I spent the next 45 minutes discussing what our course of action was to get around this situation.\n\nNo less than 5 minutes before I\u2019m saying bye to my friend on the phone, this lady sitting on the other side of the aisle to me raises her voice at me saying \n\n\u201care you going to stay on that fucking phone for the whole trip? You\u2019re being so rude!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm hello? How am I rude? I\u2019m talking to my friend and its only 12:30pm. That means daytime. That means people wont be sleeping\u201d\n\nNow I know that there may be some people asleep on the bus. I should know, I almost had a nap before my friend called me. But I\u2019m not sure how I was rude. If you didn\u2019t want this, then you should have flown and not caught a bus.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is they were on a 10-hour bus trip, and during that time they were on the phone for 3 hours. They made two calls: one to their dad and another to their best friend. The lady sitting next to them got upset and called them rude. The person is asking if they're the asshole (AITA).\n\nFirst, I need to consider bus etiquette. On buses, especially long ones, people usually expect a certain level of quiet. But it's not like a plane where there are specific rules about phone use. Buses might have different norms. The person in question was on the phone during the day, not late at night when people would be sleeping. They mentioned that they had a nap earlier, but maybe others were trying to sleep when they were talking.\n\nWait, the person says it was 12:30pm when the lady complained. They argue that it's daytime, so people aren't sleeping. But maybe not everyone is a morning person. Some people might be trying to rest during a long trip. Also, the bus was two-thirds full, so there were quite a few people. Even if it's daytime, loud phone calls can be distracting. The person was talking to their friend for 45 minutes and to their dad for some time. That's a lot of conversation in one go. \n\nThe lady's reaction was yelling, which isn't great, but maybe her frustration is because the person was being loud. However, the person's defense is that if the lady didn't want phone calls, she should have taken a flight. But flights are more expensive, and the person chose the bus because they couldn't afford a plane. That's a valid point. \n\nAlso, the person is 17, traveling alone, which might make them more sensitive to criticism from an older person. They had important reasons for calling their dad and friend. The dad had lost his phone, so communication was necessary. The friend's parents were causing issues about a planned trip, so discussing that was important too. \n\nBut even with valid reasons, maybe the volume or duration of the calls was too much. The person should have been considerate of others. Maybe they could have used a headset or lowered their voice. However, the lady's approach was confrontational. She raised her voice and called the person rude, which is aggressive. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The person had legitimate reasons for their calls, but they might not have been mindful of others' comfort. The lady's reaction was also not ideal. So, the person isn't entirely in the wrong, but they could have been more considerate. However, based on the question, the answer is either A or B. Since the person wasn't inconsiderate in intent and had valid reasons, maybe they aren't the asshole. So, the answer is B.\n"
