I was on the phone for 3 hours of a 10 hour bus trip\nSome notes:\n- this bus fare was $60 for an adult and $33 for a child (me) while a plane ticket usually averages $80 but are frequentl on sale for $60. Reason why I chose to take a bus is because I paid for the trip and I don\u2019t get paid very much from work to afford the luxury to fly just as yet.\n\n- I\u2019m 17 years old and this lady seems like she\u2019s 35-45 years old (in other words she might seem like she has some sort of authority over me because I\u2019m young and she\u2019s older)\n\n- I am travelling by myself\n\n\nSo picture this: monday morning at 9:15am 2/3rds of a bus gets filled with people to drive from Melbourne to Adelaide (~800km/500mi). I\u2019m on this bus trip for two main reasons: I have a car in Adelaide that I need to drive back to Melbourne and I also haven\u2019t seen my dad in 4 months aswell (he\u2019s the one who helped me buy the car aswell).\n\nNow up until this point, I have been trying to get in contact with my dad so I can plan this little mini-holiday and how everything will work from registering the car to discussing and fixing all the problems with the car (its an old car).  Notice how I said I was \u2018trying\u2019 to get in contact with my dad - being that he\u2019d lost his phone and hasn\u2019t been able to call me (didn\u2019t know my phone number).\nNow this was all until I called my grandparents who live in the same city as my dad. As it turned out, my father went to his parents house to use their phone to call me, right as I was about to call him. So fair enough, I was on the phone with my dad and we talked.\n\nSoon enough, we\u2019d planned our week ahead and eventually got onto other personal topics because we don\u2019t really call very often. By the time I say goodbye, it was about 11:35am. I was tired from the night before and try to get some rest.\n\nNo more than 15 minutes later, I get a call from my best friend. She was calling to tell me about how she and her parents got into a massive argument over the holiday we\u2019re going on in 9 days. To celebrate our passing of highschool, its tradition for students to go on a holiday somwhere in groups with the main intention to get as drunk as physically possible.\n\nWell, her parents had said that they didn\u2019t want her to go, although we\u2019ve all already paid $1000+ and booked it 6 months ago. Plans were SET, and we were ready to leave. So naturally I spent the next 45 minutes discussing what our course of action was to get around this situation.\n\nNo less than 5 minutes before I\u2019m saying bye to my friend on the phone, this lady sitting on the other side of the aisle to me raises her voice at me saying \n\n\u201care you going to stay on that fucking phone for the whole trip? You\u2019re being so rude!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm hello? How am I rude? I\u2019m talking to my friend and its only 12:30pm. That means daytime. That means people wont be sleeping\u201d\n\nNow I know that there may be some people asleep on the bus. I should know, I almost had a nap before my friend called me. But I\u2019m not sure how I was rude. If you didn\u2019t want this, then you should have flown and not caught a bus.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a 17-year-old on a 10-hour bus trip who was on the phone for three hours, and a lady scolded them for being rude.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the facts. The author is on a bus, which is a shared space. They were on the phone for three hours, which is a significant portion of the trip. The lady complained about this. The author argues that it's daytime, people aren't sleeping, and that if the lady didn't want noise, she should have taken a plane.\n\nNow, considering common bus etiquette. Typically, in shared spaces like buses, it's considered polite to keep phone conversations quiet or use headphones, especially if they might disturb others. The author was talking on the phone, which can be distracting even during the day. Even if some people are awake, loud conversations can be annoying.\n\nThe author mentions that they tried to get some rest before the friend called. However, after being on the phone for an extended time, it's possible others are affected. The lady's reaction is about the duration and the fact that she felt it was rude. The author's response is defensive, pointing out the time of day and the choice to take a bus.\n\nThe key points here are the duration of the phone call and the volume. If the author was speaking at a normal volume, maybe it's less of an issue, but if they were shouting or very loud, that's more disruptive. The scenario doesn't specify the volume, though. However, the lady chose to confront them, implying she found it disruptive.\n\nAlso, the author is 17, which might lead others to assume they should be more considerate, but age shouldn't determine etiquette. The main issue is whether the phone use was inconsiderate. Since buses are public transport, passengers generally expect a quiet environment. Three hours of phone usage might be seen as excessive, even during the day.\n\nThe author's reasoning about others choosing a bus instead of a plane isn't a strong defense. Plane passengers also have etiquette; loud conversations are discouraged there too. The type of transportation doesn't excuse disruptive behavior.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author was on the phone for a long time in a shared space without using headphones, leading to a complaint. Even if they didn't mean to disturb, the duration and the fact that it's a public space where quiet is expected means the author might be in the wrong. They could have used a headset or kept the conversation short and quiet.\n"
