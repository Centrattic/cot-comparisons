I was on the phone for 3 hours of a 10 hour bus trip\nSome notes:\n- this bus fare was $60 for an adult and $33 for a child (me) while a plane ticket usually averages $80 but are frequentl on sale for $60. Reason why I chose to take a bus is because I paid for the trip and I don\u2019t get paid very much from work to afford the luxury to fly just as yet.\n\n- I\u2019m 17 years old and this lady seems like she\u2019s 35-45 years old (in other words she might seem like she has some sort of authority over me because I\u2019m young and she\u2019s older)\n\n- I am travelling by myself\n\n\nSo picture this: monday morning at 9:15am 2/3rds of a bus gets filled with people to drive from Melbourne to Adelaide (~800km/500mi). I\u2019m on this bus trip for two main reasons: I have a car in Adelaide that I need to drive back to Melbourne and I also haven\u2019t seen my dad in 4 months aswell (he\u2019s the one who helped me buy the car aswell).\n\nNow up until this point, I have been trying to get in contact with my dad so I can plan this little mini-holiday and how everything will work from registering the car to discussing and fixing all the problems with the car (its an old car).  Notice how I said I was \u2018trying\u2019 to get in contact with my dad - being that he\u2019d lost his phone and hasn\u2019t been able to call me (didn\u2019t know my phone number).\nNow this was all until I called my grandparents who live in the same city as my dad. As it turned out, my father went to his parents house to use their phone to call me, right as I was about to call him. So fair enough, I was on the phone with my dad and we talked.\n\nSoon enough, we\u2019d planned our week ahead and eventually got onto other personal topics because we don\u2019t really call very often. By the time I say goodbye, it was about 11:35am. I was tired from the night before and try to get some rest.\n\nNo more than 15 minutes later, I get a call from my best friend. She was calling to tell me about how she and her parents got into a massive argument over the holiday we\u2019re going on in 9 days. To celebrate our passing of highschool, its tradition for students to go on a holiday somwhere in groups with the main intention to get as drunk as physically possible.\n\nWell, her parents had said that they didn\u2019t want her to go, although we\u2019ve all already paid $1000+ and booked it 6 months ago. Plans were SET, and we were ready to leave. So naturally I spent the next 45 minutes discussing what our course of action was to get around this situation.\n\nNo less than 5 minutes before I\u2019m saying bye to my friend on the phone, this lady sitting on the other side of the aisle to me raises her voice at me saying \n\n\u201care you going to stay on that fucking phone for the whole trip? You\u2019re being so rude!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm hello? How am I rude? I\u2019m talking to my friend and its only 12:30pm. That means daytime. That means people wont be sleeping\u201d\n\nNow I know that there may be some people asleep on the bus. I should know, I almost had a nap before my friend called me. But I\u2019m not sure how I was rude. If you didn\u2019t want this, then you should have flown and not caught a bus.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about a 17-year-old girl on a long bus trip who was on the phone for several hours, and an older woman scolded her for being rude. The author is wondering if she did something wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girl was traveling alone, which might make her more anxious or needing to stay connected. She had two main reasons for the trip: getting her car back and seeing her dad. She tried to contact her dad because he lost his phone, so when they finally connected, they talked for a while. Then her friend called about a holiday dispute, and she spent 45 minutes discussing it. \n\nThe woman sitting nearby got upset and yelled at her. The author argues that it was daytime, so people shouldn't be expecting silence, and if they wanted quiet, they should have taken a flight. But flights are more expensive, so she chose the bus because it's cheaper. She's also young and maybe feels that being on the phone isn't inherently rude.\n\nNow, thinking about social norms. On shared spaces like buses, there's an unspoken rule to be considerate. Even if it's daytime, loud phone conversations can be disruptive. Some people might be trying to read, work, or just relax. The woman's outburst might be an overreaction, but the author's use of the phone could also be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nThe author mentions that she was tired and trying to rest before her friend's call. Then the call happened, and she was on the phone for a significant chunk of the trip. Even if the content is important, the volume and duration might matter. Maybe she wasn't using headphones, so her voice was loud enough to bother others.\n\nAlso, the woman's age and the power dynamic might play a role. The older woman could be projecting her own impatience or frustration. However, the author might feel targeted because of her age. \n\nConsidering both sides: the author had a legitimate reason to talk to her dad and friend, but maybe didn't consider the environment. The woman had a right to be upset if the phone calls were disruptive. The key points are volume, duration, and sensitivity to others' needs. If the author was talking loudly or for an extended time without regard, she could be at fault. However, if she was on the phone during normal hours and not disturbing anyone specifically, maybe not. \n\nThe story says that some people might be asleep, and the author almost napped before the call. It's possible that even if it's daytime, some passengers prefer a quiet environment. The author's response to the woman's complaint was defensive, which could indicate that she didn't consider the other person's perspective. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers intent and impact. The author might not have intended to be rude, but the impact on others matters. If the woman was clearly disturbed, the author could be seen as the asshole for not being considerate. However, if the woman is overly sensitive, maybe the author isn't at fault. \n\nGiven the details, I think the author is partially in the wrong. She should have been more mindful of her surroundings, perhaps using headphones or keeping her voice down. The woman's reaction was harsh, but the author's actions also contributed to the situation. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
