I was on the phone for 3 hours of a 10 hour bus trip\nSome notes:\n- this bus fare was $60 for an adult and $33 for a child (me) while a plane ticket usually averages $80 but are frequentl on sale for $60. Reason why I chose to take a bus is because I paid for the trip and I don\u2019t get paid very much from work to afford the luxury to fly just as yet.\n\n- I\u2019m 17 years old and this lady seems like she\u2019s 35-45 years old (in other words she might seem like she has some sort of authority over me because I\u2019m young and she\u2019s older)\n\n- I am travelling by myself\n\n\nSo picture this: monday morning at 9:15am 2/3rds of a bus gets filled with people to drive from Melbourne to Adelaide (~800km/500mi). I\u2019m on this bus trip for two main reasons: I have a car in Adelaide that I need to drive back to Melbourne and I also haven\u2019t seen my dad in 4 months aswell (he\u2019s the one who helped me buy the car aswell).\n\nNow up until this point, I have been trying to get in contact with my dad so I can plan this little mini-holiday and how everything will work from registering the car to discussing and fixing all the problems with the car (its an old car).  Notice how I said I was \u2018trying\u2019 to get in contact with my dad - being that he\u2019d lost his phone and hasn\u2019t been able to call me (didn\u2019t know my phone number).\nNow this was all until I called my grandparents who live in the same city as my dad. As it turned out, my father went to his parents house to use their phone to call me, right as I was about to call him. So fair enough, I was on the phone with my dad and we talked.\n\nSoon enough, we\u2019d planned our week ahead and eventually got onto other personal topics because we don\u2019t really call very often. By the time I say goodbye, it was about 11:35am. I was tired from the night before and try to get some rest.\n\nNo more than 15 minutes later, I get a call from my best friend. She was calling to tell me about how she and her parents got into a massive argument over the holiday we\u2019re going on in 9 days. To celebrate our passing of highschool, its tradition for students to go on a holiday somwhere in groups with the main intention to get as drunk as physically possible.\n\nWell, her parents had said that they didn\u2019t want her to go, although we\u2019ve all already paid $1000+ and booked it 6 months ago. Plans were SET, and we were ready to leave. So naturally I spent the next 45 minutes discussing what our course of action was to get around this situation.\n\nNo less than 5 minutes before I\u2019m saying bye to my friend on the phone, this lady sitting on the other side of the aisle to me raises her voice at me saying \n\n\u201care you going to stay on that fucking phone for the whole trip? You\u2019re being so rude!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm hello? How am I rude? I\u2019m talking to my friend and its only 12:30pm. That means daytime. That means people wont be sleeping\u201d\n\nNow I know that there may be some people asleep on the bus. I should know, I almost had a nap before my friend called me. But I\u2019m not sure how I was rude. If you didn\u2019t want this, then you should have flown and not caught a bus.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being on the phone for 3 hours during a 10-hour bus ride. The situation involves a 17-year-old traveling alone, which adds context about their experience and possible vulnerability.\n\nFirst, the author had a valid reason to call their dad after a long time, especially since there was a communication issue due to the dad losing his phone. The call was about planning a trip and car-related matters, which seems important. Then, the friend's call was about a last-minute conflict with holiday plans they had already paid for, which is also understandable but maybe less urgent.\n\nThe key point is the lady's complaint about the phone use. The author mentions it was daytime, and they weren't aware others might be asleep. However, on a bus with many passengers, even if it's daytime, some might be trying to rest. The author's argument that if people didn't want the noise they should have flown is a bit strong. While flying is a different mode of transport, the author didn't consider the comfort of others, which is part of being considerate in shared spaces.\n\nThe age difference might play a role in the perception of authority, but the lady's outburst was about the phone use, not her age. The author's response was defensive, which is common in such situations, but maybe they could have been more considerate by using headphones or lowering their voice, especially after the initial call with the dad. The friend call might have been more conversational and harder to keep quiet, but still, the author should have been mindful of the surroundings.\n\nIn public transport, there's an unspoken rule to keep noise to a minimum. While the author had good reasons, the duration and volume might have been excessive. The lady's frustration is valid, but her choice of words was harsh. The author isn't entirely in the wrong because they had legitimate reasons, but they could have been more considerate. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong. Since they didn't do anything illegal, but maybe socially inappropriate, it's a bit of a gray area. But given the context, the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because they had valid reasons and the lady overreacted, though they could have been more considerate.\n"
