I was on the phone for 3 hours of a 10 hour bus trip\nSome notes:\n- this bus fare was $60 for an adult and $33 for a child (me) while a plane ticket usually averages $80 but are frequentl on sale for $60. Reason why I chose to take a bus is because I paid for the trip and I don\u2019t get paid very much from work to afford the luxury to fly just as yet.\n\n- I\u2019m 17 years old and this lady seems like she\u2019s 35-45 years old (in other words she might seem like she has some sort of authority over me because I\u2019m young and she\u2019s older)\n\n- I am travelling by myself\n\n\nSo picture this: monday morning at 9:15am 2/3rds of a bus gets filled with people to drive from Melbourne to Adelaide (~800km/500mi). I\u2019m on this bus trip for two main reasons: I have a car in Adelaide that I need to drive back to Melbourne and I also haven\u2019t seen my dad in 4 months aswell (he\u2019s the one who helped me buy the car aswell).\n\nNow up until this point, I have been trying to get in contact with my dad so I can plan this little mini-holiday and how everything will work from registering the car to discussing and fixing all the problems with the car (its an old car).  Notice how I said I was \u2018trying\u2019 to get in contact with my dad - being that he\u2019d lost his phone and hasn\u2019t been able to call me (didn\u2019t know my phone number).\nNow this was all until I called my grandparents who live in the same city as my dad. As it turned out, my father went to his parents house to use their phone to call me, right as I was about to call him. So fair enough, I was on the phone with my dad and we talked.\n\nSoon enough, we\u2019d planned our week ahead and eventually got onto other personal topics because we don\u2019t really call very often. By the time I say goodbye, it was about 11:35am. I was tired from the night before and try to get some rest.\n\nNo more than 15 minutes later, I get a call from my best friend. She was calling to tell me about how she and her parents got into a massive argument over the holiday we\u2019re going on in 9 days. To celebrate our passing of highschool, its tradition for students to go on a holiday somwhere in groups with the main intention to get as drunk as physically possible.\n\nWell, her parents had said that they didn\u2019t want her to go, although we\u2019ve all already paid $1000+ and booked it 6 months ago. Plans were SET, and we were ready to leave. So naturally I spent the next 45 minutes discussing what our course of action was to get around this situation.\n\nNo less than 5 minutes before I\u2019m saying bye to my friend on the phone, this lady sitting on the other side of the aisle to me raises her voice at me saying \n\n\u201care you going to stay on that fucking phone for the whole trip? You\u2019re being so rude!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm hello? How am I rude? I\u2019m talking to my friend and its only 12:30pm. That means daytime. That means people wont be sleeping\u201d\n\nNow I know that there may be some people asleep on the bus. I should know, I almost had a nap before my friend called me. But I\u2019m not sure how I was rude. If you didn\u2019t want this, then you should have flown and not caught a bus.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author was on a 10-hour bus trip and was on the phone for 3 hours. The main points are the cost difference between bus and plane, the author's age (17), traveling alone, and the interaction with a lady who called them out for being rude.\n\nFirst, the bus fare was cheaper, which makes sense because the author can't afford a plane ticket. So the choice to take the bus is understandable financially. The author was trying to contact their dad, which seems important for their plans. Then, they talked to their best friend about a holiday issue. The lady complained about the phone use, saying it's rude.\n\nNow, considering public transportation etiquette. On buses, especially long ones, people might expect some quiet. But phone calls can be disruptive, especially if loud. However, the author mentions it was daytime, and maybe not everyone is asleep. They also mention they were tired and tried to nap before the call. The friend's call was about an important matter\u2014holiday plans that were already set, so the conversation had urgency.\n\nThe lady's reaction was raised voice, which could be considered rude. The author responded calmly, pointing out the time and their right to use the phone. But the key factors here are the reasonableness of the phone use. Three hours on a 10-hour trip might seem long, but if it's split into two calls (dad and friend), each about 1.5 hours? Or maybe the total was 3 hours. Either way, public transport etiquette varies. Some people might find phone calls okay if not too loud, especially if they're necessary. But others might find it annoying.\n\nThe author is 17, which might make the lady think the author is younger and not as experienced. But the author is traveling alone, which adds context. The lady's tone was harsh, using an expletive. The author didn't use their phone excessively before the calls\u2014they tried to nap. The main issue is whether the phone use was disruptive. If the author was using a speakerphone or shouting, that's worse. But the description doesn't mention that. It's just a regular phone call.\n\nIn many places, there's no strict rule against phone calls on buses unless the company has specific policies. So legally, the author isn't wrong. Socially, it's a gray area. The lady's complaint might be valid if the author was being loud, but the author defends their right to use the phone during the day. The answer likely leans toward B (not the asshole) because the author had valid reasons for the calls, the lady overreacted, and there's no indication the author was being inconsiderate beyond normal phone use.\n"
