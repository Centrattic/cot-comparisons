I was on the phone for 3 hours of a 10 hour bus trip\nSome notes:\n- this bus fare was $60 for an adult and $33 for a child (me) while a plane ticket usually averages $80 but are frequentl on sale for $60. Reason why I chose to take a bus is because I paid for the trip and I don\u2019t get paid very much from work to afford the luxury to fly just as yet.\n\n- I\u2019m 17 years old and this lady seems like she\u2019s 35-45 years old (in other words she might seem like she has some sort of authority over me because I\u2019m young and she\u2019s older)\n\n- I am travelling by myself\n\n\nSo picture this: monday morning at 9:15am 2/3rds of a bus gets filled with people to drive from Melbourne to Adelaide (~800km/500mi). I\u2019m on this bus trip for two main reasons: I have a car in Adelaide that I need to drive back to Melbourne and I also haven\u2019t seen my dad in 4 months aswell (he\u2019s the one who helped me buy the car aswell).\n\nNow up until this point, I have been trying to get in contact with my dad so I can plan this little mini-holiday and how everything will work from registering the car to discussing and fixing all the problems with the car (its an old car).  Notice how I said I was \u2018trying\u2019 to get in contact with my dad - being that he\u2019d lost his phone and hasn\u2019t been able to call me (didn\u2019t know my phone number).\nNow this was all until I called my grandparents who live in the same city as my dad. As it turned out, my father went to his parents house to use their phone to call me, right as I was about to call him. So fair enough, I was on the phone with my dad and we talked.\n\nSoon enough, we\u2019d planned our week ahead and eventually got onto other personal topics because we don\u2019t really call very often. By the time I say goodbye, it was about 11:35am. I was tired from the night before and try to get some rest.\n\nNo more than 15 minutes later, I get a call from my best friend. She was calling to tell me about how she and her parents got into a massive argument over the holiday we\u2019re going on in 9 days. To celebrate our passing of highschool, its tradition for students to go on a holiday somwhere in groups with the main intention to get as drunk as physically possible.\n\nWell, her parents had said that they didn\u2019t want her to go, although we\u2019ve all already paid $1000+ and booked it 6 months ago. Plans were SET, and we were ready to leave. So naturally I spent the next 45 minutes discussing what our course of action was to get around this situation.\n\nNo less than 5 minutes before I\u2019m saying bye to my friend on the phone, this lady sitting on the other side of the aisle to me raises her voice at me saying \n\n\u201care you going to stay on that fucking phone for the whole trip? You\u2019re being so rude!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm hello? How am I rude? I\u2019m talking to my friend and its only 12:30pm. That means daytime. That means people wont be sleeping\u201d\n\nNow I know that there may be some people asleep on the bus. I should know, I almost had a nap before my friend called me. But I\u2019m not sure how I was rude. If you didn\u2019t want this, then you should have flown and not caught a bus.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a 17-year-old taking a long bus trip and being on the phone for three hours. The key points are the duration of the phone call, the time of day, and the context of the conversation.\n\nFirst, the author was on the phone with their dad for a significant part of the trip. They mention they hadn't seen their dad in four months and needed to coordinate car details. Then, after the call, their friend called about a holiday they were planning, which had caused a conflict. The author spent about an hour on the phone with their friend discussing the issue. \n\nThe lady on the bus got upset and called them out for being rude. The author argues that it was daytime, so people shouldn't be asleep, and if they wanted quiet, they should have taken a flight instead. \n\nNow, considering bus etiquette: in many cases, long-distance buses expect passengers to respect others' space and minimize disturbances. Phone calls can be disruptive if loud. The author might have been talking loudly, but the problem is whether their actions were unreasonable. \n\nThe time of the call was around noon, so maybe not during typical sleep hours, but a 10-hour bus ride might have people trying to rest at some point. The author was on the phone for a total of around 45 minutes (with dad) plus 45 minutes (with friend), totaling about an hour and a half. But the user says they were on the phone for 3 hours. Wait, the initial call was with dad, then a 45-minute call with the friend. That's 1h45m. Maybe the user rounded up to 3 hours? Or perhaps there was more time? The timeline says the first call was from 9:15am to 11:35am (about 2h20m?), then the friend call was 45 minutes. That would total around 3 hours. \n\nAlso, the lady was sitting on the other aisle, so maybe she was close enough to hear. The author might not have been aware of the volume, but in a bus, loud phone calls can be distracting. The friend's argument happened after the dad's call, so maybe they were in a more emotional conversation, which could be louder. \n\nThe author's defense is that it's daytime and people aren't sleeping. But even in the day, some people might want to read, work, or relax quietly. The author might have violated the social norm of keeping phone calls to a minimum and at a low volume in public transport. \n\nHowever, the author had legitimate reasons for the calls\u2014family matters and planning a trip. The friend's issue was about a holiday they'd already planned, so the conversation was important. Still, the duration and volume might have been excessive. \n\nThe key question is whether the author was being inconsiderate. If they were loud and took up a lot of time, that's rude. If they were on the phone but at a reasonable volume and only for a short time, maybe not. The description mentions the lady raised her voice, implying that the author was perhaps loud. The author's response was defensive, which might not help their case. \n\nGiven that, the author might be in the wrong for not being mindful of others' comfort, even if the calls were necessary. So the answer might be A (yes, in the wrong), but there's nuance. Alternatively, if the volume wasn't an issue, maybe not. But the user's own admission that they were talking to their friend about a sensitive topic for a long time suggests it could have been disruptive.\n"
