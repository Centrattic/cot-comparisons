I was on the phone for 3 hours of a 10 hour bus trip\nSome notes:\n- this bus fare was $60 for an adult and $33 for a child (me) while a plane ticket usually averages $80 but are frequentl on sale for $60. Reason why I chose to take a bus is because I paid for the trip and I don\u2019t get paid very much from work to afford the luxury to fly just as yet.\n\n- I\u2019m 17 years old and this lady seems like she\u2019s 35-45 years old (in other words she might seem like she has some sort of authority over me because I\u2019m young and she\u2019s older)\n\n- I am travelling by myself\n\n\nSo picture this: monday morning at 9:15am 2/3rds of a bus gets filled with people to drive from Melbourne to Adelaide (~800km/500mi). I\u2019m on this bus trip for two main reasons: I have a car in Adelaide that I need to drive back to Melbourne and I also haven\u2019t seen my dad in 4 months aswell (he\u2019s the one who helped me buy the car aswell).\n\nNow up until this point, I have been trying to get in contact with my dad so I can plan this little mini-holiday and how everything will work from registering the car to discussing and fixing all the problems with the car (its an old car).  Notice how I said I was \u2018trying\u2019 to get in contact with my dad - being that he\u2019d lost his phone and hasn\u2019t been able to call me (didn\u2019t know my phone number).\nNow this was all until I called my grandparents who live in the same city as my dad. As it turned out, my father went to his parents house to use their phone to call me, right as I was about to call him. So fair enough, I was on the phone with my dad and we talked.\n\nSoon enough, we\u2019d planned our week ahead and eventually got onto other personal topics because we don\u2019t really call very often. By the time I say goodbye, it was about 11:35am. I was tired from the night before and try to get some rest.\n\nNo more than 15 minutes later, I get a call from my best friend. She was calling to tell me about how she and her parents got into a massive argument over the holiday we\u2019re going on in 9 days. To celebrate our passing of highschool, its tradition for students to go on a holiday somwhere in groups with the main intention to get as drunk as physically possible.\n\nWell, her parents had said that they didn\u2019t want her to go, although we\u2019ve all already paid $1000+ and booked it 6 months ago. Plans were SET, and we were ready to leave. So naturally I spent the next 45 minutes discussing what our course of action was to get around this situation.\n\nNo less than 5 minutes before I\u2019m saying bye to my friend on the phone, this lady sitting on the other side of the aisle to me raises her voice at me saying \n\n\u201care you going to stay on that fucking phone for the whole trip? You\u2019re being so rude!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm hello? How am I rude? I\u2019m talking to my friend and its only 12:30pm. That means daytime. That means people wont be sleeping\u201d\n\nNow I know that there may be some people asleep on the bus. I should know, I almost had a nap before my friend called me. But I\u2019m not sure how I was rude. If you didn\u2019t want this, then you should have flown and not caught a bus.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation involves a teenager on a bus ride using their phone for a long time, and an older lady confronting them about being rude.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is 17, traveling alone, and the bus ride is 10 hours. They were on the phone for three hours. The reason given is that they were trying to contact their dad, and then later spoke with their best friend. The lady who confronted them says it's rude to be on the phone the whole trip. \n\nThe author argues that it's daytime, so people aren't sleeping, and that if the lady didn't want noise, she should have flown instead. The cost of the bus is mentioned, which is cheaper because the author isn't getting paid much. \n\nNow, the key points here: was the author being rude? In public transportation settings, especially buses, people's expectations about noise levels can vary. While it's true that some people might be okay with phone calls during the day, others might find it disruptive. The author was on the phone for a significant portion of the trip, which could be seen as inconsiderate, even if they had their reasons. \n\nHowever, the author's reasons are important. They were trying to communicate with family and friends, which is understandable. The confrontation from the lady might have been harsh, but the author's actions could still be considered rude in a shared space. The argument that \"if you don't want noise, fly\" is a bit dismissive and doesn't take into account the lady's perspective. \n\nOn the other hand, the author wasn't using headphones, which could have minimized the disturbance. Using a phone in a public space without headphones is generally considered inconsiderate. The length of the call (three hours) is also notable. Even with good intentions, the duration and lack of consideration for others' comfort might make the author at fault here. \n\nSo, while there are mitigating factors, the main issue is whether being on the phone for three hours in a public bus is considered rude. The answer depends on social norms and the specific situation. But generally, prolonged phone calls without headphones can be seen as inconsiderate, especially in a shared space where people expect a quieter environment. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
