I was on the phone for 3 hours of a 10 hour bus trip\nSome notes:\n- this bus fare was $60 for an adult and $33 for a child (me) while a plane ticket usually averages $80 but are frequentl on sale for $60. Reason why I chose to take a bus is because I paid for the trip and I don\u2019t get paid very much from work to afford the luxury to fly just as yet.\n\n- I\u2019m 17 years old and this lady seems like she\u2019s 35-45 years old (in other words she might seem like she has some sort of authority over me because I\u2019m young and she\u2019s older)\n\n- I am travelling by myself\n\n\nSo picture this: monday morning at 9:15am 2/3rds of a bus gets filled with people to drive from Melbourne to Adelaide (~800km/500mi). I\u2019m on this bus trip for two main reasons: I have a car in Adelaide that I need to drive back to Melbourne and I also haven\u2019t seen my dad in 4 months aswell (he\u2019s the one who helped me buy the car aswell).\n\nNow up until this point, I have been trying to get in contact with my dad so I can plan this little mini-holiday and how everything will work from registering the car to discussing and fixing all the problems with the car (its an old car).  Notice how I said I was \u2018trying\u2019 to get in contact with my dad - being that he\u2019d lost his phone and hasn\u2019t been able to call me (didn\u2019t know my phone number).\nNow this was all until I called my grandparents who live in the same city as my dad. As it turned out, my father went to his parents house to use their phone to call me, right as I was about to call him. So fair enough, I was on the phone with my dad and we talked.\n\nSoon enough, we\u2019d planned our week ahead and eventually got onto other personal topics because we don\u2019t really call very often. By the time I say goodbye, it was about 11:35am. I was tired from the night before and try to get some rest.\n\nNo more than 15 minutes later, I get a call from my best friend. She was calling to tell me about how she and her parents got into a massive argument over the holiday we\u2019re going on in 9 days. To celebrate our passing of highschool, its tradition for students to go on a holiday somwhere in groups with the main intention to get as drunk as physically possible.\n\nWell, her parents had said that they didn\u2019t want her to go, although we\u2019ve all already paid $1000+ and booked it 6 months ago. Plans were SET, and we were ready to leave. So naturally I spent the next 45 minutes discussing what our course of action was to get around this situation.\n\nNo less than 5 minutes before I\u2019m saying bye to my friend on the phone, this lady sitting on the other side of the aisle to me raises her voice at me saying \n\n\u201care you going to stay on that fucking phone for the whole trip? You\u2019re being so rude!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm hello? How am I rude? I\u2019m talking to my friend and its only 12:30pm. That means daytime. That means people wont be sleeping\u201d\n\nNow I know that there may be some people asleep on the bus. I should know, I almost had a nap before my friend called me. But I\u2019m not sure how I was rude. If you didn\u2019t want this, then you should have flown and not caught a bus.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about being on the phone for a long time on a bus and getting yelled at by another passenger.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the details. The person is 17, traveling alone, and chose a bus because it's cheaper. They had a 3-hour phone call with their dad, then another 45 minutes with their friend. The lady got upset, saying they were rude. The author thinks they're not in the wrong because it's daytime and people can choose other transportation.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Is talking on the phone for a long time on a bus considered rude? The author's reasoning is that since it's daytime, people aren't likely to be sleeping, and if someone doesn't want the noise, they should have taken a different transport. But buses can be loud, but maybe phone calls are disruptive even during the day if others are trying to rest.\n\nAlso, the author is young and might not be aware of social norms on public transport. The lady is older, so maybe she's enforcing what's considered polite. However, the author had valid reasons\u2014important calls about family and planning a trip. The timing: the first call was necessary for coordinating plans with the dad they hadn't seen in months, and the second call was about a friend's issue. \n\nBut the problem is that public transport has certain expectations. Even during the day, people might expect others to keep calls short or at a low volume. Maybe the author wasn't being malicious but didn't consider the other passengers' comfort. However, the lady's reaction was aggressive, using a swear word. That's also part of the situation.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, they had good reasons and weren't doing anything illegal. On the other hand, long phone calls can be disruptive. The author might not be in the wrong because they had valid reasons and the lady's reaction was harsh. But maybe they could have been more considerate, like using a headset or moving to a part of the bus where it's less disruptive. However, the post says the author was on the bus for 10 hours and the calls were a significant portion, but maybe the timing and volume were an issue.\n\nThe answer would depend on cultural norms. Some people think phone calls are okay during the day on buses, others find it rude. The author's defense is that they're on a bus, not a flight, implying buses are noisier. But the lady's outburst was unkind. \n\nI think the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they had important reasons, but maybe could have been more considerate. However, the key is whether they were in the wrong. The AITA aspect is whether they should be blamed. Since they had valid reasons and the lady was confrontational, the answer is probably \"No,\" the author isn't in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
