I was on the phone for 3 hours of a 10 hour bus trip\nSome notes:\n- this bus fare was $60 for an adult and $33 for a child (me) while a plane ticket usually averages $80 but are frequentl on sale for $60. Reason why I chose to take a bus is because I paid for the trip and I don\u2019t get paid very much from work to afford the luxury to fly just as yet.\n\n- I\u2019m 17 years old and this lady seems like she\u2019s 35-45 years old (in other words she might seem like she has some sort of authority over me because I\u2019m young and she\u2019s older)\n\n- I am travelling by myself\n\n\nSo picture this: monday morning at 9:15am 2/3rds of a bus gets filled with people to drive from Melbourne to Adelaide (~800km/500mi). I\u2019m on this bus trip for two main reasons: I have a car in Adelaide that I need to drive back to Melbourne and I also haven\u2019t seen my dad in 4 months aswell (he\u2019s the one who helped me buy the car aswell).\n\nNow up until this point, I have been trying to get in contact with my dad so I can plan this little mini-holiday and how everything will work from registering the car to discussing and fixing all the problems with the car (its an old car).  Notice how I said I was \u2018trying\u2019 to get in contact with my dad - being that he\u2019d lost his phone and hasn\u2019t been able to call me (didn\u2019t know my phone number).\nNow this was all until I called my grandparents who live in the same city as my dad. As it turned out, my father went to his parents house to use their phone to call me, right as I was about to call him. So fair enough, I was on the phone with my dad and we talked.\n\nSoon enough, we\u2019d planned our week ahead and eventually got onto other personal topics because we don\u2019t really call very often. By the time I say goodbye, it was about 11:35am. I was tired from the night before and try to get some rest.\n\nNo more than 15 minutes later, I get a call from my best friend. She was calling to tell me about how she and her parents got into a massive argument over the holiday we\u2019re going on in 9 days. To celebrate our passing of highschool, its tradition for students to go on a holiday somwhere in groups with the main intention to get as drunk as physically possible.\n\nWell, her parents had said that they didn\u2019t want her to go, although we\u2019ve all already paid $1000+ and booked it 6 months ago. Plans were SET, and we were ready to leave. So naturally I spent the next 45 minutes discussing what our course of action was to get around this situation.\n\nNo less than 5 minutes before I\u2019m saying bye to my friend on the phone, this lady sitting on the other side of the aisle to me raises her voice at me saying \n\n\u201care you going to stay on that fucking phone for the whole trip? You\u2019re being so rude!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm hello? How am I rude? I\u2019m talking to my friend and its only 12:30pm. That means daytime. That means people wont be sleeping\u201d\n\nNow I know that there may be some people asleep on the bus. I should know, I almost had a nap before my friend called me. But I\u2019m not sure how I was rude. If you didn\u2019t want this, then you should have flown and not caught a bus.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being on the phone for three hours on a 10-hour bus trip. \n\nFirst, the context: the author is 17, traveling alone, chose a bus because it's cheaper than flying. They needed to talk to their dad, who had lost his phone, which led to a 45-minute conversation. Then, their best friend called about a holiday planned months ago, and they talked for another 45 minutes. That's an hour and a half, but the total phone use was three hours. The lady got upset, saying they were being rude.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author had legitimate reasons for the initial call with their dad\u2014important family matters. The friend's call was about a planned holiday they'd already paid for, which sounds like an emergency. However, even if the calls were necessary, the duration might be an issue. \n\nBut the lady's outburst was pretty harsh. The author is a minor traveling alone, which might make the situation more sensitive. The lady's comment about flying (implying that if you don't want to be bothered, you fly instead of take a bus) is a common argument. \n\nThe author's defense is that it's daytime, so people might not be asleep. However, in a bus, even during the day, some people might be trying to work, read, or rest. Phone calls can be disruptive in such confined spaces. \n\nThe author's actions: using their own phone for necessary conversations and then a longer chat with a friend. While the initial calls were important, the friend's call lasted 45 minutes. Maybe the author could have used headphones or taken the call outside if possible. \n\nBut given the circumstances, the author might not have realized the disruption. The lady's reaction was confrontational and rude. The author's response was defensive but not aggressive. \n\nSo, considering all that, is the author in the wrong? They used their phone, but for legitimate reasons. The lady had a right to be disturbed, but her approach was inappropriate. The author might have been a bit inconsiderate, but not entirely at fault. However, in a public transport setting, expecting some level of quiet is reasonable. The three-hour phone time is a lot, even if split into two calls. \n\nHmm. Maybe the author is partly in the wrong, but the lady's reaction is also uncalled for. The question is whether the author is the asshole. Since the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide between A and B. The answer might be A (yes) because three hours of phone calls in a confined space is excessive, even if some of it was necessary. The author could have been more mindful. Alternatively, B (no) because the calls were important, and the lady was rude. \n\nI think the key here is that while the author had reasons, three hours of phone use is a lot and could be seen as inconsiderate. The lady's outburst was uncivil, but the author's actions were also not perfect. So, maybe the author is in the wrong for the duration of the calls. Answer A.\n"
