I was on the phone for 3 hours of a 10 hour bus trip\nSome notes:\n- this bus fare was $60 for an adult and $33 for a child (me) while a plane ticket usually averages $80 but are frequentl on sale for $60. Reason why I chose to take a bus is because I paid for the trip and I don\u2019t get paid very much from work to afford the luxury to fly just as yet.\n\n- I\u2019m 17 years old and this lady seems like she\u2019s 35-45 years old (in other words she might seem like she has some sort of authority over me because I\u2019m young and she\u2019s older)\n\n- I am travelling by myself\n\n\nSo picture this: monday morning at 9:15am 2/3rds of a bus gets filled with people to drive from Melbourne to Adelaide (~800km/500mi). I\u2019m on this bus trip for two main reasons: I have a car in Adelaide that I need to drive back to Melbourne and I also haven\u2019t seen my dad in 4 months aswell (he\u2019s the one who helped me buy the car aswell).\n\nNow up until this point, I have been trying to get in contact with my dad so I can plan this little mini-holiday and how everything will work from registering the car to discussing and fixing all the problems with the car (its an old car).  Notice how I said I was \u2018trying\u2019 to get in contact with my dad - being that he\u2019d lost his phone and hasn\u2019t been able to call me (didn\u2019t know my phone number).\nNow this was all until I called my grandparents who live in the same city as my dad. As it turned out, my father went to his parents house to use their phone to call me, right as I was about to call him. So fair enough, I was on the phone with my dad and we talked.\n\nSoon enough, we\u2019d planned our week ahead and eventually got onto other personal topics because we don\u2019t really call very often. By the time I say goodbye, it was about 11:35am. I was tired from the night before and try to get some rest.\n\nNo more than 15 minutes later, I get a call from my best friend. She was calling to tell me about how she and her parents got into a massive argument over the holiday we\u2019re going on in 9 days. To celebrate our passing of highschool, its tradition for students to go on a holiday somwhere in groups with the main intention to get as drunk as physically possible.\n\nWell, her parents had said that they didn\u2019t want her to go, although we\u2019ve all already paid $1000+ and booked it 6 months ago. Plans were SET, and we were ready to leave. So naturally I spent the next 45 minutes discussing what our course of action was to get around this situation.\n\nNo less than 5 minutes before I\u2019m saying bye to my friend on the phone, this lady sitting on the other side of the aisle to me raises her voice at me saying \n\n\u201care you going to stay on that fucking phone for the whole trip? You\u2019re being so rude!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm hello? How am I rude? I\u2019m talking to my friend and its only 12:30pm. That means daytime. That means people wont be sleeping\u201d\n\nNow I know that there may be some people asleep on the bus. I should know, I almost had a nap before my friend called me. But I\u2019m not sure how I was rude. If you didn\u2019t want this, then you should have flown and not caught a bus.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a 17-year-old taking a bus ride and being on the phone for three hours. The user is asking if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person chose the bus because it's cheaper than a plane, which makes sense since they don't get paid much. That's a valid reason. They were on the phone for a long time, but there are two main calls: one with their dad and another with their best friend. The dad call was necessary because they needed to plan things with their car and hadn't seen him in 4 months. The friend call was about a planned trip that had just gotten complicated, so discussing it for 45 minutes seems important too.\n\nThe lady got upset at 12:30 pm, which is still early in the day. The user points out that it's daytime, so maybe people aren't asleep yet. The user also mentions that they tried to rest before the friend call, implying they were aware of the time and the environment. However, the lady might have been disturbed by the volume or the duration of the calls. \n\nNow, the question is about whether the user was in the wrong. On one hand, using a phone on a bus can be disruptive, even in the daytime. People might need quiet to read, work, or rest. The user was on the phone for a significant part of the trip, which could be seen as inconsiderate. On the other hand, the calls were for important personal matters, and the user might not have realized the impact of their actions. Also, the lady could have politely asked if they could lower their voice instead of yelling.\n\nBut the key here is the context. The user was in a situation where they needed to handle important matters, and they were being reasonable about the time of day. The lady's reaction was aggressive, which might not be the best approach. However, the user could have been more mindful of their surroundings, maybe by using headphones or keeping the volume down. But in this case, since they were on a phone call, it's possible they weren't speaking loudly, but the presence of the call itself might be distracting.\n\nIn some public transport etiquette, it's considered rude to be on the phone for long periods, especially during a long trip. Even if it's daytime, not everyone wants to hear conversations. The user might have assumed it was okay, but the lady's reaction indicates that others might find it disruptive. So, while the user had valid reasons, they might still be in the wrong for not considering others' preferences. However, the lady's harsh response could also be part of the issue. \n\nHmm. The user isn't the worst here. They had a good reason to be on the phone, but maybe they could have been more considerate. However, the lady's approach was also confrontational. But the main question is whether the user is in the wrong. Given that the user was on the phone for a long time, even in the daytime, and the lady's complaint was about rudeness, I think the user might be slightly in the wrong for not being considerate enough, even if they had a reason. However, the context of their important calls might mitigate that. So, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the user had valid reasons and the lady's response was harsh. But I'm a bit conflicted. Alternatively, maybe the user is in the wrong because they didn't consider others' space. I'm leaning towards B, not in the wrong, but I'm not 100% sure."
