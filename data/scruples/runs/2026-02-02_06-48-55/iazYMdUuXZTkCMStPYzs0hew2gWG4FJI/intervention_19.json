I was on the phone for 3 hours of a 10 hour bus trip\nSome notes:\n- this bus fare was $60 for an adult and $33 for a child (me) while a plane ticket usually averages $80 but are frequentl on sale for $60. Reason why I chose to take a bus is because I paid for the trip and I don\u2019t get paid very much from work to afford the luxury to fly just as yet.\n\n- I\u2019m 17 years old and this lady seems like she\u2019s 35-45 years old (in other words she might seem like she has some sort of authority over me because I\u2019m young and she\u2019s older)\n\n- I am travelling by myself\n\n\nSo picture this: monday morning at 9:15am 2/3rds of a bus gets filled with people to drive from Melbourne to Adelaide (~800km/500mi). I\u2019m on this bus trip for two main reasons: I have a car in Adelaide that I need to drive back to Melbourne and I also haven\u2019t seen my dad in 4 months aswell (he\u2019s the one who helped me buy the car aswell).\n\nNow up until this point, I have been trying to get in contact with my dad so I can plan this little mini-holiday and how everything will work from registering the car to discussing and fixing all the problems with the car (its an old car).  Notice how I said I was \u2018trying\u2019 to get in contact with my dad - being that he\u2019d lost his phone and hasn\u2019t been able to call me (didn\u2019t know my phone number).\nNow this was all until I called my grandparents who live in the same city as my dad. As it turned out, my father went to his parents house to use their phone to call me, right as I was about to call him. So fair enough, I was on the phone with my dad and we talked.\n\nSoon enough, we\u2019d planned our week ahead and eventually got onto other personal topics because we don\u2019t really call very often. By the time I say goodbye, it was about 11:35am. I was tired from the night before and try to get some rest.\n\nNo more than 15 minutes later, I get a call from my best friend. She was calling to tell me about how she and her parents got into a massive argument over the holiday we\u2019re going on in 9 days. To celebrate our passing of highschool, its tradition for students to go on a holiday somwhere in groups with the main intention to get as drunk as physically possible.\n\nWell, her parents had said that they didn\u2019t want her to go, although we\u2019ve all already paid $1000+ and booked it 6 months ago. Plans were SET, and we were ready to leave. So naturally I spent the next 45 minutes discussing what our course of action was to get around this situation.\n\nNo less than 5 minutes before I\u2019m saying bye to my friend on the phone, this lady sitting on the other side of the aisle to me raises her voice at me saying \n\n\u201care you going to stay on that fucking phone for the whole trip? You\u2019re being so rude!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm hello? How am I rude? I\u2019m talking to my friend and its only 12:30pm. That means daytime. That means people wont be sleeping\u201d\n\nNow I know that there may be some people asleep on the bus. I should know, I almost had a nap before my friend called me. But I\u2019m not sure how I was rude. If you didn\u2019t want this, then you should have flown and not caught a bus.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a 17-year-old on a 10-hour bus trip, using their phone for 3 hours. The key points are the duration of the phone calls and the context of why they were on the phone.\n\nFirst, the person had two main calls: one with their dad to plan a car-related trip and a holiday, and another with their best friend about a conflict over the upcoming holiday. The lady sitting nearby got annoyed and told them off for being rude. \n\nThe user initially thought the author might be wrong but is unsure. I need to consider social norms on public transport. Generally, phone calls are frowned upon because they can disturb others. But the author's reasons are important here. They were making necessary calls for planning a holiday and family matters. The bus was only 2/3 full, so maybe not as crowded as a plane. Also, the lady's outburst was loud, which could have been more disruptive.\n\nBut the duration of 3 hours is significant. Even if the reasons are valid, that's a long time. However, the timing (midday) and the fact that others might not be sleeping could matter. The author's response to the lady was defensive, which might have escalated the situation. \n\nConsidering that the author is 17 and traveling alone, maybe their actions were less considered. But the lady's rudeness was also an issue. The main question is whether the phone use was inconsiderate. While the content of the calls was important, the length and the fact that it's a shared space where others expect quiet could tip the balance. So, the author might be in the wrong for using the phone extensively, even if intentions were good. However, the lady's reaction was also harsh. \n\nBut the question is about the author's wrong. I think the answer is A (Yes) because even though there are valid reasons, 3 hours of phone calls in a public transport setting is generally considered inconsiderate. The author should have been aware of their surroundings and maybe used headphones or found a less disruptive way to communicate.\n"
