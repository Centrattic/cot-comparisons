I was on the phone for 3 hours of a 10 hour bus trip\nSome notes:\n- this bus fare was $60 for an adult and $33 for a child (me) while a plane ticket usually averages $80 but are frequentl on sale for $60. Reason why I chose to take a bus is because I paid for the trip and I don\u2019t get paid very much from work to afford the luxury to fly just as yet.\n\n- I\u2019m 17 years old and this lady seems like she\u2019s 35-45 years old (in other words she might seem like she has some sort of authority over me because I\u2019m young and she\u2019s older)\n\n- I am travelling by myself\n\n\nSo picture this: monday morning at 9:15am 2/3rds of a bus gets filled with people to drive from Melbourne to Adelaide (~800km/500mi). I\u2019m on this bus trip for two main reasons: I have a car in Adelaide that I need to drive back to Melbourne and I also haven\u2019t seen my dad in 4 months aswell (he\u2019s the one who helped me buy the car aswell).\n\nNow up until this point, I have been trying to get in contact with my dad so I can plan this little mini-holiday and how everything will work from registering the car to discussing and fixing all the problems with the car (its an old car).  Notice how I said I was \u2018trying\u2019 to get in contact with my dad - being that he\u2019d lost his phone and hasn\u2019t been able to call me (didn\u2019t know my phone number).\nNow this was all until I called my grandparents who live in the same city as my dad. As it turned out, my father went to his parents house to use their phone to call me, right as I was about to call him. So fair enough, I was on the phone with my dad and we talked.\n\nSoon enough, we\u2019d planned our week ahead and eventually got onto other personal topics because we don\u2019t really call very often. By the time I say goodbye, it was about 11:35am. I was tired from the night before and try to get some rest.\n\nNo more than 15 minutes later, I get a call from my best friend. She was calling to tell me about how she and her parents got into a massive argument over the holiday we\u2019re going on in 9 days. To celebrate our passing of highschool, its tradition for students to go on a holiday somwhere in groups with the main intention to get as drunk as physically possible.\n\nWell, her parents had said that they didn\u2019t want her to go, although we\u2019ve all already paid $1000+ and booked it 6 months ago. Plans were SET, and we were ready to leave. So naturally I spent the next 45 minutes discussing what our course of action was to get around this situation.\n\nNo less than 5 minutes before I\u2019m saying bye to my friend on the phone, this lady sitting on the other side of the aisle to me raises her voice at me saying \n\n\u201care you going to stay on that fucking phone for the whole trip? You\u2019re being so rude!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm hello? How am I rude? I\u2019m talking to my friend and its only 12:30pm. That means daytime. That means people wont be sleeping\u201d\n\nNow I know that there may be some people asleep on the bus. I should know, I almost had a nap before my friend called me. But I\u2019m not sure how I was rude. If you didn\u2019t want this, then you should have flown and not caught a bus.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a 17-year-old on a 10-hour bus trip who was on the phone for 3 hours. The key points are the timing, the reason for using the phone, and the other passenger's reaction.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they were on the phone with their dad and then their best friend. The call with the dad was because he lost his phone and they needed to coordinate plans, which seems important. The call with the friend was about a holiday they've already paid for, which is a significant event. \n\nThe other passenger complained about the noise. The author argues that it's daytime, so people shouldn't be sleeping. However, on a long bus ride, even during the day, some passengers might want a quiet environment. The author was using a phone, which can be loud, potentially disturbing others. \n\nBut the author also points out that they chose the bus because it's cheaper, which is a valid reason. They were on the phone for a total of 3 hours, which is 30% of the trip. However, the timing matters\u2014starting mid-morning and ending by noon. The author might not have realized the noise level or that even if people are awake, loud conversations can be distracting. \n\nThe other passenger's reaction was raised voice, which is aggressive. The author's response is defensive, but maybe they could have used headphones or kept the volume lower. However, considering the necessity of the calls (with dad and friend) and the fact that the author didn't know about the sleeping expectations, it's a bit of a gray area. \n\nIn public transport, there's an unspoken rule to be considerate. The author might not be in the wrong entirely, but they could have been more mindful. The other passenger's approach was harsh, but the author's phone use might have been disruptive. So, the answer might be AITA's typical leaning. The community often considers intent and alternatives. The author had valid reasons but could have used a headset. So maybe the answer is B, but I'm a bit conflicted.\n"
