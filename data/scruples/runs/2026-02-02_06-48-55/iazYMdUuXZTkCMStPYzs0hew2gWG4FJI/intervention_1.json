I was on the phone for 3 hours of a 10 hour bus trip\nSome notes:\n- this bus fare was $60 for an adult and $33 for a child (me) while a plane ticket usually averages $80 but are frequentl on sale for $60. Reason why I chose to take a bus is because I paid for the trip and I don\u2019t get paid very much from work to afford the luxury to fly just as yet.\n\n- I\u2019m 17 years old and this lady seems like she\u2019s 35-45 years old (in other words she might seem like she has some sort of authority over me because I\u2019m young and she\u2019s older)\n\n- I am travelling by myself\n\n\nSo picture this: monday morning at 9:15am 2/3rds of a bus gets filled with people to drive from Melbourne to Adelaide (~800km/500mi). I\u2019m on this bus trip for two main reasons: I have a car in Adelaide that I need to drive back to Melbourne and I also haven\u2019t seen my dad in 4 months aswell (he\u2019s the one who helped me buy the car aswell).\n\nNow up until this point, I have been trying to get in contact with my dad so I can plan this little mini-holiday and how everything will work from registering the car to discussing and fixing all the problems with the car (its an old car).  Notice how I said I was \u2018trying\u2019 to get in contact with my dad - being that he\u2019d lost his phone and hasn\u2019t been able to call me (didn\u2019t know my phone number).\nNow this was all until I called my grandparents who live in the same city as my dad. As it turned out, my father went to his parents house to use their phone to call me, right as I was about to call him. So fair enough, I was on the phone with my dad and we talked.\n\nSoon enough, we\u2019d planned our week ahead and eventually got onto other personal topics because we don\u2019t really call very often. By the time I say goodbye, it was about 11:35am. I was tired from the night before and try to get some rest.\n\nNo more than 15 minutes later, I get a call from my best friend. She was calling to tell me about how she and her parents got into a massive argument over the holiday we\u2019re going on in 9 days. To celebrate our passing of highschool, its tradition for students to go on a holiday somwhere in groups with the main intention to get as drunk as physically possible.\n\nWell, her parents had said that they didn\u2019t want her to go, although we\u2019ve all already paid $1000+ and booked it 6 months ago. Plans were SET, and we were ready to leave. So naturally I spent the next 45 minutes discussing what our course of action was to get around this situation.\n\nNo less than 5 minutes before I\u2019m saying bye to my friend on the phone, this lady sitting on the other side of the aisle to me raises her voice at me saying \n\n\u201care you going to stay on that fucking phone for the whole trip? You\u2019re being so rude!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm hello? How am I rude? I\u2019m talking to my friend and its only 12:30pm. That means daytime. That means people wont be sleeping\u201d\n\nNow I know that there may be some people asleep on the bus. I should know, I almost had a nap before my friend called me. But I\u2019m not sure how I was rude. If you didn\u2019t want this, then you should have flown and not caught a bus.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for being on the phone for 3 hours during a 10-hour bus trip.\n\nFirst, the context: The writer is 17, traveling alone, and chose a bus over a cheaper plane ticket because of budget constraints. The bus is two-thirds full, so it's not packed. They were on the phone with their dad and then their best friend. The lady gets annoyed and confronts them. \n\nThe key points here are about social norms on public transport. Generally, it's considered rude to talk loudly on the phone in places where people expect quiet, like buses. But the writer was talking during the day when others might be trying to rest. Even though it's daytime, the noise level matters. \n\nThe writer mentions that they had a nap intention before the call, and others might have been trying to sleep. The lady's complaint was about the duration and the noise. The writer's defense is that if she didn't want the noise, she should have flown. But planes are typically noisier and have stricter rules against phone calls, so that's a weak argument. \n\nAlso, the writer was on the phone for 3 hours. That's a long time on a bus where others might need quiet. Even if it's daytime, respecting others' space and noise levels is important. The fact that they were discussing personal matters and planning could have been done more quietly or in a different setting. \n\nSo, even though the writer had valid reasons for the calls, the duration and the volume might have been disruptive. The lady's reaction is understandable because public transport is a shared space, and while there's no strict rule, common courtesy suggests using headphones or keeping calls short and quiet. The writer might not be the absolute asshole, but there's room for them to be considerate. \n\nBut the answer is a binary A/B. The user thinks the author is in the wrong. Considering all factors, even if the writer had reasons, the length and the disruption might make them in the wrong. So answer A.\n"
