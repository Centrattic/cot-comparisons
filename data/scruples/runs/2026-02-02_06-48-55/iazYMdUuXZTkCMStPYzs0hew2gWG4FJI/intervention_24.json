I was on the phone for 3 hours of a 10 hour bus trip\nSome notes:\n- this bus fare was $60 for an adult and $33 for a child (me) while a plane ticket usually averages $80 but are frequentl on sale for $60. Reason why I chose to take a bus is because I paid for the trip and I don\u2019t get paid very much from work to afford the luxury to fly just as yet.\n\n- I\u2019m 17 years old and this lady seems like she\u2019s 35-45 years old (in other words she might seem like she has some sort of authority over me because I\u2019m young and she\u2019s older)\n\n- I am travelling by myself\n\n\nSo picture this: monday morning at 9:15am 2/3rds of a bus gets filled with people to drive from Melbourne to Adelaide (~800km/500mi). I\u2019m on this bus trip for two main reasons: I have a car in Adelaide that I need to drive back to Melbourne and I also haven\u2019t seen my dad in 4 months aswell (he\u2019s the one who helped me buy the car aswell).\n\nNow up until this point, I have been trying to get in contact with my dad so I can plan this little mini-holiday and how everything will work from registering the car to discussing and fixing all the problems with the car (its an old car).  Notice how I said I was \u2018trying\u2019 to get in contact with my dad - being that he\u2019d lost his phone and hasn\u2019t been able to call me (didn\u2019t know my phone number).\nNow this was all until I called my grandparents who live in the same city as my dad. As it turned out, my father went to his parents house to use their phone to call me, right as I was about to call him. So fair enough, I was on the phone with my dad and we talked.\n\nSoon enough, we\u2019d planned our week ahead and eventually got onto other personal topics because we don\u2019t really call very often. By the time I say goodbye, it was about 11:35am. I was tired from the night before and try to get some rest.\n\nNo more than 15 minutes later, I get a call from my best friend. She was calling to tell me about how she and her parents got into a massive argument over the holiday we\u2019re going on in 9 days. To celebrate our passing of highschool, its tradition for students to go on a holiday somwhere in groups with the main intention to get as drunk as physically possible.\n\nWell, her parents had said that they didn\u2019t want her to go, although we\u2019ve all already paid $1000+ and booked it 6 months ago. Plans were SET, and we were ready to leave. So naturally I spent the next 45 minutes discussing what our course of action was to get around this situation.\n\nNo less than 5 minutes before I\u2019m saying bye to my friend on the phone, this lady sitting on the other side of the aisle to me raises her voice at me saying \n\n\u201care you going to stay on that fucking phone for the whole trip? You\u2019re being so rude!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm hello? How am I rude? I\u2019m talking to my friend and its only 12:30pm. That means daytime. That means people wont be sleeping\u201d\n\nNow I know that there may be some people asleep on the bus. I should know, I almost had a nap before my friend called me. But I\u2019m not sure how I was rude. If you didn\u2019t want this, then you should have flown and not caught a bus.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author, a 17-year-old, took a bus trip where they were on the phone for a couple of hours. The bus was already two-thirds full, and they were talking to their dad and then their best friend. The lady next to them got upset and called them out for being rude. The author is asking if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions they chose the bus because it's cheaper, and they can't afford a plane ticket. That's understandable, especially since they're 17 and working. The main issue here is the phone use. They were on the phone for a significant portion of the trip, talking to family and a friend. The lady complained about it, saying they're being rude and might be disturbing others.\n\nNow, in public transportation, there are usually some unspoken rules about phone use. Most people expect that you can use your phone, but you should be considerate of others. The author was talking on the phone, not using headphones, so others could hear the conversation. Even if it was daytime, not everyone might be asleep, but there could still be people trying to work, read, or rest. The author's argument is that if the lady didn't want the noise, she shouldn't have taken the bus. That might not be the best approach because even on a bus, there are people who talk, and others might get annoyed.\n\nThe key points here: the author was on the phone for 3 hours out of a 10-hour trip. That's a long time. Even if they had a good reason, like talking to family, the way they responded to the lady's complaint was defensive. The author also mentions they tried to get some rest before the friend called, implying they were tired. But the lady's complaint came after the initial nap attempt. \n\nIs it reasonable to talk on the phone for 3 hours without headphones? Probably not. Even if you have a valid reason, others might be affected. The author's response was dismissive, which could be seen as rude. So, even though they had their reasons, the action of talking loudly on the phone in a confined space where people might be trying to be quiet is where the issue lies. The author might not be the asshole entirely, but they could have been more considerate. However, the lady's approach of yelling was also not great. But the question is if the author is in the wrong. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer might be A (they are in the wrong) because they used their phone in a way that disturbed others, even if the reasons were valid. But maybe B (not in the wrong) because the lady overreacted. Hmm. It's a bit tricky. The author's defense is that it's daytime and people aren't asleep, but in a bus, there's an expectation of quiet, especially if people are trying to rest. So maybe the answer is A.\n"
