I was on the phone for 3 hours of a 10 hour bus trip\nSome notes:\n- this bus fare was $60 for an adult and $33 for a child (me) while a plane ticket usually averages $80 but are frequentl on sale for $60. Reason why I chose to take a bus is because I paid for the trip and I don\u2019t get paid very much from work to afford the luxury to fly just as yet.\n\n- I\u2019m 17 years old and this lady seems like she\u2019s 35-45 years old (in other words she might seem like she has some sort of authority over me because I\u2019m young and she\u2019s older)\n\n- I am travelling by myself\n\n\nSo picture this: monday morning at 9:15am 2/3rds of a bus gets filled with people to drive from Melbourne to Adelaide (~800km/500mi). I\u2019m on this bus trip for two main reasons: I have a car in Adelaide that I need to drive back to Melbourne and I also haven\u2019t seen my dad in 4 months aswell (he\u2019s the one who helped me buy the car aswell).\n\nNow up until this point, I have been trying to get in contact with my dad so I can plan this little mini-holiday and how everything will work from registering the car to discussing and fixing all the problems with the car (its an old car).  Notice how I said I was \u2018trying\u2019 to get in contact with my dad - being that he\u2019d lost his phone and hasn\u2019t been able to call me (didn\u2019t know my phone number).\nNow this was all until I called my grandparents who live in the same city as my dad. As it turned out, my father went to his parents house to use their phone to call me, right as I was about to call him. So fair enough, I was on the phone with my dad and we talked.\n\nSoon enough, we\u2019d planned our week ahead and eventually got onto other personal topics because we don\u2019t really call very often. By the time I say goodbye, it was about 11:35am. I was tired from the night before and try to get some rest.\n\nNo more than 15 minutes later, I get a call from my best friend. She was calling to tell me about how she and her parents got into a massive argument over the holiday we\u2019re going on in 9 days. To celebrate our passing of highschool, its tradition for students to go on a holiday somwhere in groups with the main intention to get as drunk as physically possible.\n\nWell, her parents had said that they didn\u2019t want her to go, although we\u2019ve all already paid $1000+ and booked it 6 months ago. Plans were SET, and we were ready to leave. So naturally I spent the next 45 minutes discussing what our course of action was to get around this situation.\n\nNo less than 5 minutes before I\u2019m saying bye to my friend on the phone, this lady sitting on the other side of the aisle to me raises her voice at me saying \n\n\u201care you going to stay on that fucking phone for the whole trip? You\u2019re being so rude!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm hello? How am I rude? I\u2019m talking to my friend and its only 12:30pm. That means daytime. That means people wont be sleeping\u201d\n\nNow I know that there may be some people asleep on the bus. I should know, I almost had a nap before my friend called me. But I\u2019m not sure how I was rude. If you didn\u2019t want this, then you should have flown and not caught a bus.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a 17-year-old taking a 10-hour bus trip, using the phone for three hours. The key points are the time of day, the reason for the calls, and the other passenger's reaction.\n\nFirst, the time: it's midday, 12:30 pm. The author mentions that it's daytime, so people might not be sleeping. However, even during the day, some passengers might want a quieter environment, especially on a long-haul bus. But since it's not nighttime, maybe the expectation for quiet isn't as strong as in the evening.\n\nThe author's reasons for the calls: first, trying to contact his dad for important matters (car, holiday plans) after his dad lost his phone. Then a call with his best friend about a planned holiday they've already paid for. These seem like valid reasons. However, the total time on the phone is three hours. That's a significant portion of the 10-hour trip, especially if others are trying to read, work, or rest.\n\nThe other passenger's complaint is about being \"rude\" for using the phone. The author points out that if the lady didn't want phone use, she should have flown instead. But buses are generally shared spaces where people expect a mix of activities, including some noise. However, there might be an unspoken etiquette to keep calls short and considerate, especially during what could be a time when people want to rest or work.\n\nThe author is 17, and the lady is in her 30s-40s. There's a possible power dynamic here, but the issue is about phone use, not authority. The author's defense is that it's daytime and people aren't sleeping. However, even in the day, constant loud phone conversations can be disruptive. The author might have been loud or not using a headset, leading to the complaint.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author had legitimate reasons but spent three hours on the phone. The lady's reaction might be over the top, but the author could have been more considerate, like using headphones or keeping the volume down. The author's response was defensive, which might not help the situation. But the core question is whether the author was in the wrong. \n\nConsidering all factors: the time of day, the reasons for the calls, and the typical expectations on a bus. The author had a right to make necessary calls, but maybe should have been more mindful of the environment. However, the lady's approach was confrontational. The author's actions might not be clearly wrong, but there's room for considerate behavior. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the time was appropriate, and the calls were important. But if the author was loud or inconsiderate, maybe A. The story doesn't specify if the volume was an issue, just the duration. The judgment is tricky, but given the information, B seems more likely.\n"
