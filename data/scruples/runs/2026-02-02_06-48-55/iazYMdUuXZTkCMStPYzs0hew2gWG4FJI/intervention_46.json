I was on the phone for 3 hours of a 10 hour bus trip\nSome notes:\n- this bus fare was $60 for an adult and $33 for a child (me) while a plane ticket usually averages $80 but are frequentl on sale for $60. Reason why I chose to take a bus is because I paid for the trip and I don\u2019t get paid very much from work to afford the luxury to fly just as yet.\n\n- I\u2019m 17 years old and this lady seems like she\u2019s 35-45 years old (in other words she might seem like she has some sort of authority over me because I\u2019m young and she\u2019s older)\n\n- I am travelling by myself\n\n\nSo picture this: monday morning at 9:15am 2/3rds of a bus gets filled with people to drive from Melbourne to Adelaide (~800km/500mi). I\u2019m on this bus trip for two main reasons: I have a car in Adelaide that I need to drive back to Melbourne and I also haven\u2019t seen my dad in 4 months aswell (he\u2019s the one who helped me buy the car aswell).\n\nNow up until this point, I have been trying to get in contact with my dad so I can plan this little mini-holiday and how everything will work from registering the car to discussing and fixing all the problems with the car (its an old car).  Notice how I said I was \u2018trying\u2019 to get in contact with my dad - being that he\u2019d lost his phone and hasn\u2019t been able to call me (didn\u2019t know my phone number).\nNow this was all until I called my grandparents who live in the same city as my dad. As it turned out, my father went to his parents house to use their phone to call me, right as I was about to call him. So fair enough, I was on the phone with my dad and we talked.\n\nSoon enough, we\u2019d planned our week ahead and eventually got onto other personal topics because we don\u2019t really call very often. By the time I say goodbye, it was about 11:35am. I was tired from the night before and try to get some rest.\n\nNo more than 15 minutes later, I get a call from my best friend. She was calling to tell me about how she and her parents got into a massive argument over the holiday we\u2019re going on in 9 days. To celebrate our passing of highschool, its tradition for students to go on a holiday somwhere in groups with the main intention to get as drunk as physically possible.\n\nWell, her parents had said that they didn\u2019t want her to go, although we\u2019ve all already paid $1000+ and booked it 6 months ago. Plans were SET, and we were ready to leave. So naturally I spent the next 45 minutes discussing what our course of action was to get around this situation.\n\nNo less than 5 minutes before I\u2019m saying bye to my friend on the phone, this lady sitting on the other side of the aisle to me raises her voice at me saying \n\n\u201care you going to stay on that fucking phone for the whole trip? You\u2019re being so rude!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm hello? How am I rude? I\u2019m talking to my friend and its only 12:30pm. That means daytime. That means people wont be sleeping\u201d\n\nNow I know that there may be some people asleep on the bus. I should know, I almost had a nap before my friend called me. But I\u2019m not sure how I was rude. If you didn\u2019t want this, then you should have flown and not caught a bus.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being on the phone for three hours on a 10-hour bus trip. The situation involves a 17-year-old traveling alone, with specific reasons for choosing the bus over a plane due to cost. The main incident is a confrontation with an older lady who called the author out for being rude.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was on the phone for a significant portion of the trip. They mention talking to their dad and then their best friend. The first call was about planning a family matter (car and dad's issues), which sounds legitimate. The second call was about a planned holiday that had already been set, which seems important to the author. However, the duration adds up to three hours. \n\nThe lady's complaint is that the author is being rude. In public transportation, especially buses, there's an unspoken etiquette about phone use. While there's no strict rule, most people expect that excessive phone use, especially loud conversations, might disturb others. The author claims to be in a daytime setting, so maybe not everyone is sleeping, but the bus is a shared space. The author was using the phone in a way that others might find disruptive, even if they weren't sure if people were asleep. \n\nThe key points here: the author was on the phone for a long time, which could be seen as inconsiderate. They might not have been using headphones if they were talking, which would make it louder. The lady's outburst is a reaction to her discomfort. The author's defense is that the lady should have flown if she didn't want to deal with bus noises, but that's a bit flip and doesn't address the actual disturbance caused. \n\nHowever, the author's reasons for the calls were valid\u2014family and planning a trip. The duration might be excessive, but it's not illegal. The question is whether the author was being rude. Etiquette-wise, maybe they should have been quieter or used a headset. The lady's reaction was harsh, but the author might have been inconsiderate. \n\nSo, while the author had legitimate reasons, their phone use could have been more considerate. They might not be in the wrong if they were using their phone in a way that's allowed, but the duration and volume could have been adjusted. However, the answer depends on social norms. Since the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide between A and B. I think the answer is A because the author's behavior, while understandable, was inconsiderate and disruptive, even if not illegal. So the author is in the wrong.\n"
