I was on the phone for 3 hours of a 10 hour bus trip\nSome notes:\n- this bus fare was $60 for an adult and $33 for a child (me) while a plane ticket usually averages $80 but are frequentl on sale for $60. Reason why I chose to take a bus is because I paid for the trip and I don\u2019t get paid very much from work to afford the luxury to fly just as yet.\n\n- I\u2019m 17 years old and this lady seems like she\u2019s 35-45 years old (in other words she might seem like she has some sort of authority over me because I\u2019m young and she\u2019s older)\n\n- I am travelling by myself\n\n\nSo picture this: monday morning at 9:15am 2/3rds of a bus gets filled with people to drive from Melbourne to Adelaide (~800km/500mi). I\u2019m on this bus trip for two main reasons: I have a car in Adelaide that I need to drive back to Melbourne and I also haven\u2019t seen my dad in 4 months aswell (he\u2019s the one who helped me buy the car aswell).\n\nNow up until this point, I have been trying to get in contact with my dad so I can plan this little mini-holiday and how everything will work from registering the car to discussing and fixing all the problems with the car (its an old car).  Notice how I said I was \u2018trying\u2019 to get in contact with my dad - being that he\u2019d lost his phone and hasn\u2019t been able to call me (didn\u2019t know my phone number).\nNow this was all until I called my grandparents who live in the same city as my dad. As it turned out, my father went to his parents house to use their phone to call me, right as I was about to call him. So fair enough, I was on the phone with my dad and we talked.\n\nSoon enough, we\u2019d planned our week ahead and eventually got onto other personal topics because we don\u2019t really call very often. By the time I say goodbye, it was about 11:35am. I was tired from the night before and try to get some rest.\n\nNo more than 15 minutes later, I get a call from my best friend. She was calling to tell me about how she and her parents got into a massive argument over the holiday we\u2019re going on in 9 days. To celebrate our passing of highschool, its tradition for students to go on a holiday somwhere in groups with the main intention to get as drunk as physically possible.\n\nWell, her parents had said that they didn\u2019t want her to go, although we\u2019ve all already paid $1000+ and booked it 6 months ago. Plans were SET, and we were ready to leave. So naturally I spent the next 45 minutes discussing what our course of action was to get around this situation.\n\nNo less than 5 minutes before I\u2019m saying bye to my friend on the phone, this lady sitting on the other side of the aisle to me raises her voice at me saying \n\n\u201care you going to stay on that fucking phone for the whole trip? You\u2019re being so rude!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm hello? How am I rude? I\u2019m talking to my friend and its only 12:30pm. That means daytime. That means people wont be sleeping\u201d\n\nNow I know that there may be some people asleep on the bus. I should know, I almost had a nap before my friend called me. But I\u2019m not sure how I was rude. If you didn\u2019t want this, then you should have flown and not caught a bus.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a 17-year-old who was on the phone for several hours on a bus ride. The person got yelled at by another passenger for being rude.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is 17, traveling alone, and chose a bus because it's cheaper. The bus ride is 10 hours, and they were on the phone for 3 hours. The reasons given for being on the phone are talking to family and friends about important matters, like planning a trip and dealing with a car issue. \n\nThe lady got upset and told them to stop being rude. The author argues that since it's daytime and people might not be sleeping, it's okay. But the question is whether the author was in the wrong.\n\nPublic transportation etiquette is a factor here. Even if it's daytime, loud phone calls can be disruptive. However, the author mentions that they were in a situation where they needed to discuss important matters, especially since their dad lost his phone and they had to coordinate plans. Also, talking to a friend about a holiday that they had already paid for and had conflicts with parents seems like a valid reason.\n\nOn the other hand, the lady might feel that being on the phone for hours is inconsiderate, regardless of the time. Bus environments are shared spaces, and even if the author is not loud, the amount of time spent on the phone could be seen as taking up others' space. But the author's defense is that they were trying to handle necessary communication and that not everyone would be asleep. Also, the cost of the bus was a financial decision, so maybe they didn't expect to be judged for using the phone.\n\nThe key points are: importance of the calls, time of day, and whether the author was being disruptive. The author might not be in the wrong if the calls were necessary, but if they were loud or ignored others' comfort, maybe they are. The story doesn't mention if the author was on speakerphone or just loud. Since the lady was the one to confront them, perhaps the author's phone calls were indeed disruptive. But the author's response was defensive, which could be seen as dismissive. However, the context of their situation (traveling alone, important matters) might justify it. \n\nIn the end, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they had valid reasons and the lady's reaction was harsh. But others might argue that they should have been more considerate. The answer hinges on balance between personal needs and public space considerations. Since the author's actions were part of necessary communication and not necessarily loud, the answer could be B (not in the wrong).\n"
