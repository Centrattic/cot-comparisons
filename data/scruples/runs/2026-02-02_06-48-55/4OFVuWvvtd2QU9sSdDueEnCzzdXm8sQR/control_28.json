As he runs by I grab him by the backpack strap and yank him, throwing him to the ground. The bucket rolled a few feet away. As he jumped up his attention was fixed on me, starting to rush me. I could tell he was willing to fight for the money instead of cutting his losses and running away. \n\nI took a step back to improve my range for a counter if needed (I am a bouncer and have a enough boxing and Jiu-Jitsu training to handle myself; not much but enough). He decided to just go for the bucket and run off instead of attacking me. \n\nI didn\u2019t stop him. \n\nI could have, maybe. But a few thoughts went through my head as soon as he went for the bucket instead of me. \n\u201cI won\u2019t have the element of surprise the second time\u201d\n\u201cThere are no other men around to help if things go bad.\u201d\nAnd\n\u201cBest case scenario: I\u2019m the hero for rescuing $50 worth of quarters that don\u2019t really belong to anyone except a massive non-profit.\u201d\n\u201cWorst case scenario: I get stabbed in front of my girlfriend for trying to rescue $50 worth of quarters.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t worth it. \nAnyways, back to the asshole part. The two women catch up as he runs off. The short overweight one sarcastically mentions something about what a Good Samaritan I was. I say \u201cexcuse me?\u201d hoping that I misread her tone. She then scoffs at me again blaming me for letting him get away. \n\nI reply stating that I wasn\u2019t going to risk getting stabbed over a few dollars. \n\nTo which she says \u201cthis is the reason I\u2019m going into the [police] academy! Because of guys like you not doing anything to help!\u201d \n\nI yell back \u201cFuck you!\u201d and nothing more. She didn\u2019t like that very much. She said \u201csay it again! I\u2019m on the phone with the cops!\u201d Which is when we decided to leave. \n\nThis happened last night and I\u2019m still wondering if I should\u2019ve done more and cared more, and if she was right to call me out. My girlfriend thinks I did the right thing and so did my boss (who is an ex cop) but part of me still feels like Peter Parker letting the robber who then murdered his uncle get away. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author and his girlfriend were walking when they saw a man running off with a Salvation Army bucket. The man had two women chasing him. The author grabs the man's backpack, throws him down, but when the man goes for the bucket instead of fighting, the author lets him go. Then the woman (the short one) calls him out for not helping, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, the author is a bouncer with some martial arts training. He intervened initially by tackling the man, which stopped the theft momentarily. But when the man went for the bucket again, the author decided not to pursue. His reasoning was about the risks involved\u2014like getting stabbed for a small amount of money. His girlfriend and boss (ex-cop) agree he did the right thing.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong for letting the thief go. Well, the law here is important. If the author was a regular citizen, when can you legally use force to prevent a crime? In most jurisdictions, you can use reasonable force to protect property, but there's a limit. However, once the thief has the bucket and is fleeing, using further force could be considered excessive or unnecessary. The author already attempted to stop him initially, which could be seen as reasonable. Then, when the thief is running off, maybe it's not worth escalating the situation, especially if the author is now in a worse position. \n\nAlso, there's the aspect of personal safety. The author mentions he's in a situation where he's not sure if others are around to help. If he pursued the thief further, he might have put himself in danger. The woman accused him of not helping, but the author's judgment was that the risk wasn't worth the reward. His boss, an ex-cop, supports his decision, which adds weight to the idea that he made a reasonable choice. \n\nOn the other hand, the Salvation Army is a charitable organization, and the money is for a good cause. The thief is taking from that. But the author's role here is a private citizen, not a law enforcement officer. The legal duty for citizens isn't the same as for police. The author did take some action, which might be enough. The comment about Peter Parker and his uncle is a metaphor, but in real life, the author isn't a cop or a superhero. \n\nThe woman was being confrontational, and the author's response was firm, but he didn't engage in a physical fight. The key points are that the author acted initially, then made a judgment based on the circumstances. So, in terms of legal and moral responsibility, it's debatable. However, since the author is not in law enforcement, he isn't obligated to risk his safety for every crime. His decision was based on assessed risks, and he had support from his girlfriend and boss. Therefore, he's not in the wrong.\n"
