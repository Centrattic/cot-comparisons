As he runs by I grab him by the backpack strap and yank him, throwing him to the ground. The bucket rolled a few feet away. As he jumped up his attention was fixed on me, starting to rush me. I could tell he was willing to fight for the money instead of cutting his losses and running away. \n\nI took a step back to improve my range for a counter if needed (I am a bouncer and have a enough boxing and Jiu-Jitsu training to handle myself; not much but enough). He decided to just go for the bucket and run off instead of attacking me. \n\nI didn\u2019t stop him. \n\nI could have, maybe. But a few thoughts went through my head as soon as he went for the bucket instead of me. \n\u201cI won\u2019t have the element of surprise the second time\u201d\n\u201cThere are no other men around to help if things go bad.\u201d\nAnd\n\u201cBest case scenario: I\u2019m the hero for rescuing $50 worth of quarters that don\u2019t really belong to anyone except a massive non-profit.\u201d\n\u201cWorst case scenario: I get stabbed in front of my girlfriend for trying to rescue $50 worth of quarters.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t worth it. \nAnyways, back to the asshole part. The two women catch up as he runs off. The short overweight one sarcastically mentions something about what a Good Samaritan I was. I say \u201cexcuse me?\u201d hoping that I misread her tone. She then scoffs at me again blaming me for letting him get away. \n\nI reply stating that I wasn\u2019t going to risk getting stabbed over a few dollars. \n\nTo which she says \u201cthis is the reason I\u2019m going into the [police] academy! Because of guys like you not doing anything to help!\u201d \n\nI yell back \u201cFuck you!\u201d and nothing more. She didn\u2019t like that very much. She said \u201csay it again! I\u2019m on the phone with the cops!\u201d Which is when we decided to leave. \n\nThis happened last night and I\u2019m still wondering if I should\u2019ve done more and cared more, and if she was right to call me out. My girlfriend thinks I did the right thing and so did my boss (who is an ex cop) but part of me still feels like Peter Parker letting the robber who then murdered his uncle get away. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for not chasing the thief after initially stopping him.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author pulled the thief down, got the bucket, but then let the thief go when he went for the bucket instead of attacking. The thief then ran off. The Salvation Army worker and another woman were upset, especially the latter who was critical. The author's girlfriend and boss (a former cop) supported him, but he's conflicted.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Let's consider the factors. The author used force to stop the thief, which might be justified as self-defense or citizen's arrest. However, after the thief decided to retrieve the bucket and run, the author chose not to pursue. The key here is whether he had a duty to continue the confrontation. \n\nThe author's reasoning includes personal safety: he's aware of the risk of getting hurt and the lack of backup. He also mentions that the money isn't privately owned but by a non-profit. The value is low ($50 in quarters), so the stakes aren't high. \n\nIn legal terms, a citizen's arrest typically requires the person to have probable cause and to use reasonable force. However, once the thief stops resisting and opts to flee, the obligation to pursue might not be there, especially if it's not a high-value item. The author's decision to prioritize his safety over chasing the thief could be seen as reasonable. \n\nThe criticism from the other woman about not helping is harsh, especially given the low stakes. The author's boss, an ex-cop, agreeing he did the right thing supports that. The girlfriend also backs him up. \n\nThe author's conflict is more about personal guilt rather than legal or moral obligation. The reference to Peter Parker's uncle Ben is a metaphor for feeling responsible for not preventing a bad outcome, but in this case, the consequences aren't as severe as a murder. \n\nConsidering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. His actions were justified to prevent escalation and protect himself, especially given the minimal value involved. The other party's judgment is misplaced. So the answer should be B.\n"
