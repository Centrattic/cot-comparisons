As he runs by I grab him by the backpack strap and yank him, throwing him to the ground. The bucket rolled a few feet away. As he jumped up his attention was fixed on me, starting to rush me. I could tell he was willing to fight for the money instead of cutting his losses and running away. \n\nI took a step back to improve my range for a counter if needed (I am a bouncer and have a enough boxing and Jiu-Jitsu training to handle myself; not much but enough). He decided to just go for the bucket and run off instead of attacking me. \n\nI didn\u2019t stop him. \n\nI could have, maybe. But a few thoughts went through my head as soon as he went for the bucket instead of me. \n\u201cI won\u2019t have the element of surprise the second time\u201d\n\u201cThere are no other men around to help if things go bad.\u201d\nAnd\n\u201cBest case scenario: I\u2019m the hero for rescuing $50 worth of quarters that don\u2019t really belong to anyone except a massive non-profit.\u201d\n\u201cWorst case scenario: I get stabbed in front of my girlfriend for trying to rescue $50 worth of quarters.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t worth it. \nAnyways, back to the asshole part. The two women catch up as he runs off. The short overweight one sarcastically mentions something about what a Good Samaritan I was. I say \u201cexcuse me?\u201d hoping that I misread her tone. She then scoffs at me again blaming me for letting him get away. \n\nI reply stating that I wasn\u2019t going to risk getting stabbed over a few dollars. \n\nTo which she says \u201cthis is the reason I\u2019m going into the [police] academy! Because of guys like you not doing anything to help!\u201d \n\nI yell back \u201cFuck you!\u201d and nothing more. She didn\u2019t like that very much. She said \u201csay it again! I\u2019m on the phone with the cops!\u201d Which is when we decided to leave. \n\nThis happened last night and I\u2019m still wondering if I should\u2019ve done more and cared more, and if she was right to call me out. My girlfriend thinks I did the right thing and so did my boss (who is an ex cop) but part of me still feels like Peter Parker letting the robber who then murdered his uncle get away. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a thief taking a Salvation Army bucket, the author grabbing him but then letting him go. The key points are the author's reasoning and the consequences.\n\nFirst, the author physically confronts the thief, causing him to fall. The thief then tries to run off with the bucket. The author steps back and decides not to pursue. He lists his reasons: not wanting to risk getting stabbed, not having help, and the low value of the money. His girlfriend and boss support him, but another woman criticizes him, leading to an argument.\n\nNow, considering the law. In many places, citizens can use reasonable force to prevent a crime. However, if the thief is fleeing, the use of force might be less justified. The author initially used force to stop the thief, but once the thief was getting up and moving away, maybe the risk increased. The author's training suggests he knows some self-defense, so he might assess that continuing the confrontation could lead to more danger. \n\nAlso, the money is for a nonprofit, but it's only $50. The author's safety is a factor. If he had pursued and there was an injury, that could lead to liability. His reasoning seems pragmatic: the value of the money versus his safety. \n\nThe other woman's reaction is harsh, but her opinion doesn't necessarily make him wrong. The girlfriend and ex-cop boss think he did right, which adds weight to his decision being reasonable. \n\nHowever, he did let the thief escape after an initial confrontation. Some might argue that once you've stopped a thief, you should hold on until authorities arrive. But if the situation escalates, it's not always safe. The author made a judgment call based on immediate risks. \n\nIn legal terms, citizens' arrests have specific requirements. If he had detained the thief, he might have needed to call the police. Since he didn't, maybe he was in a gray area. But considering the circumstances, his decision to prioritize safety over pursuing the thief could be seen as justifiable. \n\nMoral responsibility is another angle. The comparison to Peter Parker is a strong emotional point, but real-life decisions involve risk assessment. The author didn't ignore the situation entirely; he intervened, then chose not to escalate. \n\nSo, considering all factors\u2014the immediate danger, the value of the property, the presence of others not helping, and the expert opinions supporting his choice\u2014it seems the author made a reasonable decision based on his assessment. Therefore, he's not in the wrong.\n"
