As he runs by I grab him by the backpack strap and yank him, throwing him to the ground. The bucket rolled a few feet away. As he jumped up his attention was fixed on me, starting to rush me. I could tell he was willing to fight for the money instead of cutting his losses and running away. \n\nI took a step back to improve my range for a counter if needed (I am a bouncer and have a enough boxing and Jiu-Jitsu training to handle myself; not much but enough). He decided to just go for the bucket and run off instead of attacking me. \n\nI didn\u2019t stop him. \n\nI could have, maybe. But a few thoughts went through my head as soon as he went for the bucket instead of me. \n\u201cI won\u2019t have the element of surprise the second time\u201d\n\u201cThere are no other men around to help if things go bad.\u201d\nAnd\n\u201cBest case scenario: I\u2019m the hero for rescuing $50 worth of quarters that don\u2019t really belong to anyone except a massive non-profit.\u201d\n\u201cWorst case scenario: I get stabbed in front of my girlfriend for trying to rescue $50 worth of quarters.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t worth it. \nAnyways, back to the asshole part. The two women catch up as he runs off. The short overweight one sarcastically mentions something about what a Good Samaritan I was. I say \u201cexcuse me?\u201d hoping that I misread her tone. She then scoffs at me again blaming me for letting him get away. \n\nI reply stating that I wasn\u2019t going to risk getting stabbed over a few dollars. \n\nTo which she says \u201cthis is the reason I\u2019m going into the [police] academy! Because of guys like you not doing anything to help!\u201d \n\nI yell back \u201cFuck you!\u201d and nothing more. She didn\u2019t like that very much. She said \u201csay it again! I\u2019m on the phone with the cops!\u201d Which is when we decided to leave. \n\nThis happened last night and I\u2019m still wondering if I should\u2019ve done more and cared more, and if she was right to call me out. My girlfriend thinks I did the right thing and so did my boss (who is an ex cop) but part of me still feels like Peter Parker letting the robber who then murdered his uncle get away. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a theft where he intervened partially but let the thief go. He tackled the guy but then let him escape when he chose to run after the bucket instead of fighting. \n\nFirst, the author took action by grabbing the thief and throwing him down. That shows he tried to stop the theft. But when the thief went for the bucket again, he didn't stop him. His reasoning was about personal safety and the risk of getting hurt for a small amount of money.\n\nThe other woman got angry, saying he didn't do enough. But his girlfriend and his ex-cop boss supported his decision. The author is conflicted, comparing himself to Peter Parker, implying guilt over not stopping the thief completely. \n\nI need to consider legal and moral aspects. Legally, he might not be obligated to pursue the thief after he disarmed the situation. Morally, it's a grey area. He prioritized his safety, which is reasonable. The thief wasn't armed, but the author considered the risk of a fight. \n\nThe key points are his training (bouncer, some martial arts), the assessment of risk, and the value of the stolen money. The author made a judgment call that saving $50 wasn't worth the risk. His boss's support suggests that his actions were reasonable from a law enforcement perspective.\n\nSo, while he might feel guilty, from an external viewpoint, he acted within reasonable self-defense and situational judgment. He did take initial action, and letting go when the risk increased makes sense. Therefore, he might not be in the wrong.\n"
