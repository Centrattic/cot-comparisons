As he runs by I grab him by the backpack strap and yank him, throwing him to the ground. The bucket rolled a few feet away. As he jumped up his attention was fixed on me, starting to rush me. I could tell he was willing to fight for the money instead of cutting his losses and running away. \n\nI took a step back to improve my range for a counter if needed (I am a bouncer and have a enough boxing and Jiu-Jitsu training to handle myself; not much but enough). He decided to just go for the bucket and run off instead of attacking me. \n\nI didn\u2019t stop him. \n\nI could have, maybe. But a few thoughts went through my head as soon as he went for the bucket instead of me. \n\u201cI won\u2019t have the element of surprise the second time\u201d\n\u201cThere are no other men around to help if things go bad.\u201d\nAnd\n\u201cBest case scenario: I\u2019m the hero for rescuing $50 worth of quarters that don\u2019t really belong to anyone except a massive non-profit.\u201d\n\u201cWorst case scenario: I get stabbed in front of my girlfriend for trying to rescue $50 worth of quarters.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t worth it. \nAnyways, back to the asshole part. The two women catch up as he runs off. The short overweight one sarcastically mentions something about what a Good Samaritan I was. I say \u201cexcuse me?\u201d hoping that I misread her tone. She then scoffs at me again blaming me for letting him get away. \n\nI reply stating that I wasn\u2019t going to risk getting stabbed over a few dollars. \n\nTo which she says \u201cthis is the reason I\u2019m going into the [police] academy! Because of guys like you not doing anything to help!\u201d \n\nI yell back \u201cFuck you!\u201d and nothing more. She didn\u2019t like that very much. She said \u201csay it again! I\u2019m on the phone with the cops!\u201d Which is when we decided to leave. \n\nThis happened last night and I\u2019m still wondering if I should\u2019ve done more and cared more, and if she was right to call me out. My girlfriend thinks I did the right thing and so did my boss (who is an ex cop) but part of me still feels like Peter Parker letting the robber who then murdered his uncle get away. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The scenario is about a thief stealing a Salvation Army bucket, and the author (AITA) stops him briefly but then lets him go. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the thief is running away with the bucket. The author grabs him, throws him to the ground, but then the thief goes for the bucket again. The author decides not to chase him further, considering possible dangers like getting stabbed. The short, overweight woman criticizes him, and he yells back. The girlfriend and his boss (ex-cop) support him, but he feels guilty.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. From a legal standpoint, he used some force to stop the thief. But when the thief turned back, he let him go. Did he act within his rights? In many places, you can use reasonable force to protect property. However, once the thief is fleeing, the justification for using force might be less. Also, escalating the situation could lead to more danger.\n\nThe author considered the risks and chose not to pursue, which might be a responsible decision. The woman's criticism and his own internal conflict are there, but his safety is a factor. His girlfriend and boss agree he did right. However, the thief was stealing from a charity, so there's a moral aspect too. But is not risking personal safety for $50 wrong? It's a judgment call.\n\nIn terms of morality, some might think he should have tried harder to stop the thief. Others would agree that personal safety is paramount. Legally, he might not be liable because he didn't allow the thief to get away without some resistance. However, the key point is that he did intervene, which prevented the thief from getting away immediately. Then, when the thief went back for the bucket, he realized the danger and let him go. So, the decision to prioritize self-preservation might not be wrong.\n\nThe woman's reaction is harsh, and her comment about becoming a police officer seems hypocritical if she's not acting herself. The author's response was defensive, but given the context, it's understandable. The girlfriend's support and the boss's agreement add credibility to his decision.\n\nIn the end, the author did stop the thief initially, assessed the risk, and chose not to escalate. So, he's not necessarily in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
