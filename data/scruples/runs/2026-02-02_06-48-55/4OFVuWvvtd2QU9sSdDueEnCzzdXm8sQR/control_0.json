As he runs by I grab him by the backpack strap and yank him, throwing him to the ground. The bucket rolled a few feet away. As he jumped up his attention was fixed on me, starting to rush me. I could tell he was willing to fight for the money instead of cutting his losses and running away. \n\nI took a step back to improve my range for a counter if needed (I am a bouncer and have a enough boxing and Jiu-Jitsu training to handle myself; not much but enough). He decided to just go for the bucket and run off instead of attacking me. \n\nI didn\u2019t stop him. \n\nI could have, maybe. But a few thoughts went through my head as soon as he went for the bucket instead of me. \n\u201cI won\u2019t have the element of surprise the second time\u201d\n\u201cThere are no other men around to help if things go bad.\u201d\nAnd\n\u201cBest case scenario: I\u2019m the hero for rescuing $50 worth of quarters that don\u2019t really belong to anyone except a massive non-profit.\u201d\n\u201cWorst case scenario: I get stabbed in front of my girlfriend for trying to rescue $50 worth of quarters.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t worth it. \nAnyways, back to the asshole part. The two women catch up as he runs off. The short overweight one sarcastically mentions something about what a Good Samaritan I was. I say \u201cexcuse me?\u201d hoping that I misread her tone. She then scoffs at me again blaming me for letting him get away. \n\nI reply stating that I wasn\u2019t going to risk getting stabbed over a few dollars. \n\nTo which she says \u201cthis is the reason I\u2019m going into the [police] academy! Because of guys like you not doing anything to help!\u201d \n\nI yell back \u201cFuck you!\u201d and nothing more. She didn\u2019t like that very much. She said \u201csay it again! I\u2019m on the phone with the cops!\u201d Which is when we decided to leave. \n\nThis happened last night and I\u2019m still wondering if I should\u2019ve done more and cared more, and if she was right to call me out. My girlfriend thinks I did the right thing and so did my boss (who is an ex cop) but part of me still feels like Peter Parker letting the robber who then murdered his uncle get away. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation where they let a thief escape after confronting him. The story is from an \"Am I the Asshole\" scenario.\n\nFirst, the author and his GF were walking when a man ran off with a Salvation Army bucket. The author tackled him, but then let him go when the thief went for the bucket instead of attacking. The other woman gets angry, accusing him of not doing enough. The author's reasoning is that he didn't want to risk getting hurt for $50, and he's conflicted about whether he did the right thing.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break down the factors here.\n\nThe initial action: he tried to stop the thief. That's commendable. He subdued him, but then let him go when the thief prioritized the bucket over attacking him. The author explains his rationale\u2014he's aware of the risks, his training, and the potential for escalation. His boss, an ex-cop, and his GF agree with his decision. The other woman, possibly a police academy candidate, is critical, but her tone seems sarcastic and aggressive.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in many places, you can use reasonable force to prevent a crime, but once the threat is neutralized (thief has the bucket but isn't attacking), it's up to law enforcement to handle. The author likely assessed that chasing the thief could lead to more danger without a clear legal responsibility. His reasoning about not risking injury for $50 is practical. \n\nThe other woman's reaction might be more about her personal mission (joining police) than the actual situation. The author didn't engage further, which could be seen as prudent. The key here is that he did act initially, but chose not to escalate. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because he made a judgment call based on safety and practicality. The woman's harsh response might be more about her own frustrations. The author's decision aligns with self-preservation and considering the bigger consequences. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
