As he runs by I grab him by the backpack strap and yank him, throwing him to the ground. The bucket rolled a few feet away. As he jumped up his attention was fixed on me, starting to rush me. I could tell he was willing to fight for the money instead of cutting his losses and running away. \n\nI took a step back to improve my range for a counter if needed (I am a bouncer and have a enough boxing and Jiu-Jitsu training to handle myself; not much but enough). He decided to just go for the bucket and run off instead of attacking me. \n\nI didn\u2019t stop him. \n\nI could have, maybe. But a few thoughts went through my head as soon as he went for the bucket instead of me. \n\u201cI won\u2019t have the element of surprise the second time\u201d\n\u201cThere are no other men around to help if things go bad.\u201d\nAnd\n\u201cBest case scenario: I\u2019m the hero for rescuing $50 worth of quarters that don\u2019t really belong to anyone except a massive non-profit.\u201d\n\u201cWorst case scenario: I get stabbed in front of my girlfriend for trying to rescue $50 worth of quarters.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t worth it. \nAnyways, back to the asshole part. The two women catch up as he runs off. The short overweight one sarcastically mentions something about what a Good Samaritan I was. I say \u201cexcuse me?\u201d hoping that I misread her tone. She then scoffs at me again blaming me for letting him get away. \n\nI reply stating that I wasn\u2019t going to risk getting stabbed over a few dollars. \n\nTo which she says \u201cthis is the reason I\u2019m going into the [police] academy! Because of guys like you not doing anything to help!\u201d \n\nI yell back \u201cFuck you!\u201d and nothing more. She didn\u2019t like that very much. She said \u201csay it again! I\u2019m on the phone with the cops!\u201d Which is when we decided to leave. \n\nThis happened last night and I\u2019m still wondering if I should\u2019ve done more and cared more, and if she was right to call me out. My girlfriend thinks I did the right thing and so did my boss (who is an ex cop) but part of me still feels like Peter Parker letting the robber who then murdered his uncle get away. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation involves a robbery of a Salvation Army bucket, and the author intervened partially but then let the thief go.\n\nFirst, the author physically confronted the thief, grabbing him and throwing him to the ground. That action probably prevented the theft and got the bucket back for a moment. Then, when the thief rushed for the bucket again, the author decided not to stop him. The key points here are the author's reasoning and the consequences.\n\nThe author mentions being a bouncer with some training, which implies they know how to handle themselves. Their reasoning for not stopping the thief again includes the risk of getting hurt, lack of backup, and the low value of the money. They also mention that the bucket was for a non-profit, so maybe the money isn't as significant as the principle of stopping the crime.\n\nThe other woman was upset, thinking the author didn't help enough. The author's girlfriend and boss supported their decision. The conflict with the woman leads to an argument, and the author feels guilt similar to Peter Parker's Uncle Ben story.\n\nNow, evaluating if the author is in the wrong. If someone sees a crime happening and can safely stop it without risk, not acting could be considered wrong. But in this case, after the initial engagement, the thief was fleeing. The author had already intervened once and then chose not to escalate further due to potential danger. The value of the money is low, and the risk to personal safety is higher. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, using force to stop a crime can be justified, but only if necessary and reasonable. The author's initial action was reasonable to prevent the theft. Letting the thief go after he had been subdued and was fleeing might be seen as a tactical decision to avoid further conflict and danger.\n\nMoral-wise, some might argue that saving the money isn't worth risking injury, especially when the thief was already captured once. Others might think that once you start intervening, you should follow through unless there's a compelling reason not to. The author's hesitation could be seen as a pragmatic choice rather than a moral failing.\n\nThe woman's reaction is harsh, but the author's reasoning is based on self-preservation and safety. The support from the girlfriend and the ex-cop boss adds weight to the idea that the decision was sound in practical terms.\n\nIn conclusion, the author made a calculated decision to avoid unnecessary risk after an initial act of intervention. Their actions can be viewed as responsible given the circumstances. Therefore, they are not in the wrong.\n"
