As he runs by I grab him by the backpack strap and yank him, throwing him to the ground. The bucket rolled a few feet away. As he jumped up his attention was fixed on me, starting to rush me. I could tell he was willing to fight for the money instead of cutting his losses and running away. \n\nI took a step back to improve my range for a counter if needed (I am a bouncer and have a enough boxing and Jiu-Jitsu training to handle myself; not much but enough). He decided to just go for the bucket and run off instead of attacking me. \n\nI didn\u2019t stop him. \n\nI could have, maybe. But a few thoughts went through my head as soon as he went for the bucket instead of me. \n\u201cI won\u2019t have the element of surprise the second time\u201d\n\u201cThere are no other men around to help if things go bad.\u201d\nAnd\n\u201cBest case scenario: I\u2019m the hero for rescuing $50 worth of quarters that don\u2019t really belong to anyone except a massive non-profit.\u201d\n\u201cWorst case scenario: I get stabbed in front of my girlfriend for trying to rescue $50 worth of quarters.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t worth it. \nAnyways, back to the asshole part. The two women catch up as he runs off. The short overweight one sarcastically mentions something about what a Good Samaritan I was. I say \u201cexcuse me?\u201d hoping that I misread her tone. She then scoffs at me again blaming me for letting him get away. \n\nI reply stating that I wasn\u2019t going to risk getting stabbed over a few dollars. \n\nTo which she says \u201cthis is the reason I\u2019m going into the [police] academy! Because of guys like you not doing anything to help!\u201d \n\nI yell back \u201cFuck you!\u201d and nothing more. She didn\u2019t like that very much. She said \u201csay it again! I\u2019m on the phone with the cops!\u201d Which is when we decided to leave. \n\nThis happened last night and I\u2019m still wondering if I should\u2019ve done more and cared more, and if she was right to call me out. My girlfriend thinks I did the right thing and so did my boss (who is an ex cop) but part of me still feels like Peter Parker letting the robber who then murdered his uncle get away. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The scenario involves a person who tried to stop a thief but then let him go after an initial confrontation.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The author grabbed the thief, causing him to fall, but then didn't pursue further when the thief went for the bucket instead of fighting. The thief then escaped, and the woman got angry, leading to a confrontation.\n\nThe author's reasoning was about risk versus reward. He considered that he might not be able to stop the thief without risking his own safety, and he's a bouncer with some training, but not a trained officer. The woman accused him of not helping, which made him feel guilty.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. Legally, using force to stop a theft could be justified, but the line between defense and excessive force is thin. The author did use force initially by grabbing the thief's backpack and throwing him. However, once the thief didn't escalate further and instead went for the bucket, the author chose not to pursue. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, some might argue that once you start, you should see it through. But others might say that the author made a rational decision to avoid potential harm to himself, especially considering he's not a law enforcement officer. The value of the money was $50, which isn't a huge amount, so the risk of injury for that might be seen as unreasonable by some.\n\nThe girlfriend and the boss (ex-cop) support the author, which adds weight to the idea that he made the right choice. However, the woman's reaction suggests that she had a different perspective, possibly expecting someone to intervene regardless of the risk.\n\nIt's also important to consider if the author's initial action of grabbing the thief was necessary. If the thief wasn't trying to attack him at that point, using force might be excessive. However, in the heat of the moment, the author might have felt threatened by the thief's intentions to fight.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, citizens have the right to use reasonable force to protect property, but the threshold for what's reasonable is key. The author's decision to let go after the initial confrontation might be seen as prudent to avoid escalating the situation further.\n\nSo, balancing the potential harm to himself against the value of the stolen property, the author's choice might be justified. The fact that others, including a police officer, supported his decision also points to him not being in the wrong. However, there's a moral argument that he could have done more, but it's not a legal obligation for a civilian to pursue a thief to the point of risking serious injury unless they're in a position to do so safely.\n"
