As he runs by I grab him by the backpack strap and yank him, throwing him to the ground. The bucket rolled a few feet away. As he jumped up his attention was fixed on me, starting to rush me. I could tell he was willing to fight for the money instead of cutting his losses and running away. \n\nI took a step back to improve my range for a counter if needed (I am a bouncer and have a enough boxing and Jiu-Jitsu training to handle myself; not much but enough). He decided to just go for the bucket and run off instead of attacking me. \n\nI didn\u2019t stop him. \n\nI could have, maybe. But a few thoughts went through my head as soon as he went for the bucket instead of me. \n\u201cI won\u2019t have the element of surprise the second time\u201d\n\u201cThere are no other men around to help if things go bad.\u201d\nAnd\n\u201cBest case scenario: I\u2019m the hero for rescuing $50 worth of quarters that don\u2019t really belong to anyone except a massive non-profit.\u201d\n\u201cWorst case scenario: I get stabbed in front of my girlfriend for trying to rescue $50 worth of quarters.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t worth it. \nAnyways, back to the asshole part. The two women catch up as he runs off. The short overweight one sarcastically mentions something about what a Good Samaritan I was. I say \u201cexcuse me?\u201d hoping that I misread her tone. She then scoffs at me again blaming me for letting him get away. \n\nI reply stating that I wasn\u2019t going to risk getting stabbed over a few dollars. \n\nTo which she says \u201cthis is the reason I\u2019m going into the [police] academy! Because of guys like you not doing anything to help!\u201d \n\nI yell back \u201cFuck you!\u201d and nothing more. She didn\u2019t like that very much. She said \u201csay it again! I\u2019m on the phone with the cops!\u201d Which is when we decided to leave. \n\nThis happened last night and I\u2019m still wondering if I should\u2019ve done more and cared more, and if she was right to call me out. My girlfriend thinks I did the right thing and so did my boss (who is an ex cop) but part of me still feels like Peter Parker letting the robber who then murdered his uncle get away. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they saw someone stealing a Salvation Army bucket. The author grabbed the thief, threw him down, but then let him run off with the bucket. The thief didn't attack them, and the author didn't pursue further. The other woman, who's going into the police academy, got angry and called them out for not helping more.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's reasoning. They mention they're a bouncer with some training, so they're aware of potential danger. They let the thief go because they didn't want to risk getting hurt, especially over $50. They think the worst case is getting stabbed for not much money. The boss (ex-cop) and girlfriend think they did the right thing. But the woman is upset, comparing the author to Peter Parker who let the robber escape, leading to his uncle's death.\n\nSo, the key points are: Did the author do enough? Was it their responsibility to stop the thief? Is self-preservation a valid reason to not chase the thief? The author argues that they were in a position to stop the theft but chose not to due to risk. The other woman argues that someone should have intervened, even if it's not them.\n\nI think this comes down to personal responsibility and risk assessment. The author took action initially by stopping the thief, preventing him from getting away immediately. But when the thief turned to get the bucket instead of fighting, the author chose not to pursue. The author's reasoning is about personal safety, which is valid. However, the other perspective is that once you've stopped a crime, you should follow through if possible. But maybe the author was right to assess that pursuing could lead to a dangerous situation. The fact that others (girlfriend, boss) support them suggests that their decision was reasonable. The woman's reaction might be more about her own frustration and the police academy angle than the actual rightness of the author's actions.\n\nSo, I'm leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because the author acted in a way that prioritized safety and recognized the potential danger, which is a valid consideration. The other person's anger might be more about their own expectations and less about the author's actual responsibility. Also, the thief could have been harmed if the author had chased, which isn't ideal. The author did stop the immediate theft, so maybe they aren't in the wrong for choosing not to pursue further.\n"
