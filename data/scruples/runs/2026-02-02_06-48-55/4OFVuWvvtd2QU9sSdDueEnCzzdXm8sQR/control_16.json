As he runs by I grab him by the backpack strap and yank him, throwing him to the ground. The bucket rolled a few feet away. As he jumped up his attention was fixed on me, starting to rush me. I could tell he was willing to fight for the money instead of cutting his losses and running away. \n\nI took a step back to improve my range for a counter if needed (I am a bouncer and have a enough boxing and Jiu-Jitsu training to handle myself; not much but enough). He decided to just go for the bucket and run off instead of attacking me. \n\nI didn\u2019t stop him. \n\nI could have, maybe. But a few thoughts went through my head as soon as he went for the bucket instead of me. \n\u201cI won\u2019t have the element of surprise the second time\u201d\n\u201cThere are no other men around to help if things go bad.\u201d\nAnd\n\u201cBest case scenario: I\u2019m the hero for rescuing $50 worth of quarters that don\u2019t really belong to anyone except a massive non-profit.\u201d\n\u201cWorst case scenario: I get stabbed in front of my girlfriend for trying to rescue $50 worth of quarters.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t worth it. \nAnyways, back to the asshole part. The two women catch up as he runs off. The short overweight one sarcastically mentions something about what a Good Samaritan I was. I say \u201cexcuse me?\u201d hoping that I misread her tone. She then scoffs at me again blaming me for letting him get away. \n\nI reply stating that I wasn\u2019t going to risk getting stabbed over a few dollars. \n\nTo which she says \u201cthis is the reason I\u2019m going into the [police] academy! Because of guys like you not doing anything to help!\u201d \n\nI yell back \u201cFuck you!\u201d and nothing more. She didn\u2019t like that very much. She said \u201csay it again! I\u2019m on the phone with the cops!\u201d Which is when we decided to leave. \n\nThis happened last night and I\u2019m still wondering if I should\u2019ve done more and cared more, and if she was right to call me out. My girlfriend thinks I did the right thing and so did my boss (who is an ex cop) but part of me still feels like Peter Parker letting the robber who then murdered his uncle get away. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves them stopping a thief from stealing a Salvation Army bucket but then letting him run off after the thief decides to flee instead of fight. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author intervened by grabbing the thief, which stopped him momentarily. But when the thief went for the bucket instead of attacking, the author let him go. The reasoning was about personal safety, not wanting to risk getting hurt for a small amount of money. His girlfriend and his boss (a former cop) think he did the right thing, but he's conflicted because of the other woman's reaction and his own feelings of guilt.\n\nNow, considering legal and ethical aspects. Legally, he wasn't obligated to pursue the thief after the initial confrontation. Using force to stop a crime can be justified up to a point, but continuing to engage could lead to liability. The author assessed the situation and decided not to escalate, which might be seen as prudent self-defense. \n\nEthically, there's a debate between doing the \"right\" thing by trying to recover the money versus ensuring personal safety. The Salvation Army bucket is for donations, so the money does belong to the organization. However, the amount was $50 in quarters, which isn't life-changing. The author's decision to prioritize safety could be reasonable, especially given his training and the potential risks involved. \n\nThe other woman's criticism is harsh, but her judgment might be based on her own perspective. The author's girlfriend and boss support his choice, suggesting that in their view, he wasn't at fault. The comparison to Peter Parker's scenario adds emotional weight, but real-life decisions aren't always as clear-cut as fictional stories. \n\nAlso, the presence of other witnesses and the women pursuing the thief might mean that the situation was already being addressed. The author's role was to stop the theft in the moment, and once the thief chose not to engage further, continuing pursuit wasn't necessary. \n\nIn conclusion, the author made a judgment call based on the immediate risks and his own capabilities. His actions were a split-second decision that many might make in similar circumstances. Therefore, he's not in the wrong.\n"
