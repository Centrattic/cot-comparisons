As he runs by I grab him by the backpack strap and yank him, throwing him to the ground. The bucket rolled a few feet away. As he jumped up his attention was fixed on me, starting to rush me. I could tell he was willing to fight for the money instead of cutting his losses and running away. \n\nI took a step back to improve my range for a counter if needed (I am a bouncer and have a enough boxing and Jiu-Jitsu training to handle myself; not much but enough). He decided to just go for the bucket and run off instead of attacking me. \n\nI didn\u2019t stop him. \n\nI could have, maybe. But a few thoughts went through my head as soon as he went for the bucket instead of me. \n\u201cI won\u2019t have the element of surprise the second time\u201d\n\u201cThere are no other men around to help if things go bad.\u201d\nAnd\n\u201cBest case scenario: I\u2019m the hero for rescuing $50 worth of quarters that don\u2019t really belong to anyone except a massive non-profit.\u201d\n\u201cWorst case scenario: I get stabbed in front of my girlfriend for trying to rescue $50 worth of quarters.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t worth it. \nAnyways, back to the asshole part. The two women catch up as he runs off. The short overweight one sarcastically mentions something about what a Good Samaritan I was. I say \u201cexcuse me?\u201d hoping that I misread her tone. She then scoffs at me again blaming me for letting him get away. \n\nI reply stating that I wasn\u2019t going to risk getting stabbed over a few dollars. \n\nTo which she says \u201cthis is the reason I\u2019m going into the [police] academy! Because of guys like you not doing anything to help!\u201d \n\nI yell back \u201cFuck you!\u201d and nothing more. She didn\u2019t like that very much. She said \u201csay it again! I\u2019m on the phone with the cops!\u201d Which is when we decided to leave. \n\nThis happened last night and I\u2019m still wondering if I should\u2019ve done more and cared more, and if she was right to call me out. My girlfriend thinks I did the right thing and so did my boss (who is an ex cop) but part of me still feels like Peter Parker letting the robber who then murdered his uncle get away. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author saw a man running away with a Salvation Army bucket, which they suspect was stolen. He tried to stop him by grabbing his backpack, causing the man to fall. The man then went for the bucket instead of confronting the author. The author didn't pursue further because he thought it wasn't worth risking his safety for $50 in quarters, especially since he's a bouncer with some training but not a professional. The women criticizes him, and he ended up yelling back. His girlfriend and his ex-cop boss think he did the right thing, but he's feeling guilty like Peter Parker.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The user thinks he is, but I need to evaluate. First, the ethical aspect. He tried to stop the thief initially, which shows some intent to do the right thing. But when the thief went for the bucket, he chose not to pursue. Is that negligence? The key factors here are self-preservation and the value of the money. The bucket is for a non-profit, so the money is important for their cause. However, the author is not a police officer, so he's not obligated to put himself in danger. His reasoning about not risking injury over a small amount is valid. \n\nThe women's reaction seems harsh. She's sarcastic and blames him for letting the thief escape. The author's response was defensive, which is understandable. But he didn't engage in a fight or let the thief get away completely\u2014he stopped them initially and the thief still had the bucket. The author's choice to prioritize his own safety, especially in a situation where he's not trained for a prolonged confrontation, is a common argument in such scenarios. \n\nHowever, some might argue that once he started the confrontation, he should have followed through, even if it was risky. But realistically, most people would avoid escalating a dangerous situation unless they're trained and equipped. The ex-cop boss agreeing he did the right thing supports that. The girlfriend's support also suggests that the immediate environment doesn't see him as wrong. \n\nOn the other hand, the feeling of guilt is there, comparing himself to Peter Parker. But in Spider-Man's case, the stakes were higher (his uncle's life), whereas here, the author's judgment is about physical safety and property. The value of $50 in quarters is not as high as a human life, so the analogy might not hold. \n\nSo, considering all factors: he acted to stop the theft initially, then made a judgment call based on risk, supported by his boss and girlfriend. The women's reaction is more about frustration than justified blame. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
