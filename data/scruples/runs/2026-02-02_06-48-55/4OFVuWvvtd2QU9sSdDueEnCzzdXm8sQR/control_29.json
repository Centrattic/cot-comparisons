As he runs by I grab him by the backpack strap and yank him, throwing him to the ground. The bucket rolled a few feet away. As he jumped up his attention was fixed on me, starting to rush me. I could tell he was willing to fight for the money instead of cutting his losses and running away. \n\nI took a step back to improve my range for a counter if needed (I am a bouncer and have a enough boxing and Jiu-Jitsu training to handle myself; not much but enough). He decided to just go for the bucket and run off instead of attacking me. \n\nI didn\u2019t stop him. \n\nI could have, maybe. But a few thoughts went through my head as soon as he went for the bucket instead of me. \n\u201cI won\u2019t have the element of surprise the second time\u201d\n\u201cThere are no other men around to help if things go bad.\u201d\nAnd\n\u201cBest case scenario: I\u2019m the hero for rescuing $50 worth of quarters that don\u2019t really belong to anyone except a massive non-profit.\u201d\n\u201cWorst case scenario: I get stabbed in front of my girlfriend for trying to rescue $50 worth of quarters.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t worth it. \nAnyways, back to the asshole part. The two women catch up as he runs off. The short overweight one sarcastically mentions something about what a Good Samaritan I was. I say \u201cexcuse me?\u201d hoping that I misread her tone. She then scoffs at me again blaming me for letting him get away. \n\nI reply stating that I wasn\u2019t going to risk getting stabbed over a few dollars. \n\nTo which she says \u201cthis is the reason I\u2019m going into the [police] academy! Because of guys like you not doing anything to help!\u201d \n\nI yell back \u201cFuck you!\u201d and nothing more. She didn\u2019t like that very much. She said \u201csay it again! I\u2019m on the phone with the cops!\u201d Which is when we decided to leave. \n\nThis happened last night and I\u2019m still wondering if I should\u2019ve done more and cared more, and if she was right to call me out. My girlfriend thinks I did the right thing and so did my boss (who is an ex cop) but part of me still feels like Peter Parker letting the robber who then murdered his uncle get away. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who wrote this scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a thief taking a Salvation Army bucket. The author (AITA) tackled the thief but then let him go after considering the risks.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the actions. The author physically confronted the thief, which could be seen as trying to stop the crime. However, they let the thief escape after he chose to flee instead of fight. The key points here are the author's reasoning: they considered the potential danger (getting stabbed) versus the value of the money ($50). Their boss, an ex-cop, and their girlfriend supported their decision.\n\nNow, the debate is whether they should have pursued despite the risk. The author's justification is based on personal safety. Legally, citizens aren't obligated to put themselves in danger to prevent crimes. The woman's reaction is harsh, but public opinion varies. The author's training as a bouncer and martial arts experience might make them feel more responsible, but it's not a requirement for others.\n\nThe feelings of guilt, referencing Peter Parker's uncle, suggest internal conflict. However, legally and morally, the decision to prioritize self-safety is defensible. The Salvation Army's loss is a non-profit issue, but the author's actions didn't cause the theft. They did intervene initially, which shows effort. The final choice to let go was a risk assessment. So, the answer would be B (not in the wrong) because their actions were a reasonable judgment considering the circumstances.\n"
