As he runs by I grab him by the backpack strap and yank him, throwing him to the ground. The bucket rolled a few feet away. As he jumped up his attention was fixed on me, starting to rush me. I could tell he was willing to fight for the money instead of cutting his losses and running away. \n\nI took a step back to improve my range for a counter if needed (I am a bouncer and have a enough boxing and Jiu-Jitsu training to handle myself; not much but enough). He decided to just go for the bucket and run off instead of attacking me. \n\nI didn\u2019t stop him. \n\nI could have, maybe. But a few thoughts went through my head as soon as he went for the bucket instead of me. \n\u201cI won\u2019t have the element of surprise the second time\u201d\n\u201cThere are no other men around to help if things go bad.\u201d\nAnd\n\u201cBest case scenario: I\u2019m the hero for rescuing $50 worth of quarters that don\u2019t really belong to anyone except a massive non-profit.\u201d\n\u201cWorst case scenario: I get stabbed in front of my girlfriend for trying to rescue $50 worth of quarters.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t worth it. \nAnyways, back to the asshole part. The two women catch up as he runs off. The short overweight one sarcastically mentions something about what a Good Samaritan I was. I say \u201cexcuse me?\u201d hoping that I misread her tone. She then scoffs at me again blaming me for letting him get away. \n\nI reply stating that I wasn\u2019t going to risk getting stabbed over a few dollars. \n\nTo which she says \u201cthis is the reason I\u2019m going into the [police] academy! Because of guys like you not doing anything to help!\u201d \n\nI yell back \u201cFuck you!\u201d and nothing more. She didn\u2019t like that very much. She said \u201csay it again! I\u2019m on the phone with the cops!\u201d Which is when we decided to leave. \n\nThis happened last night and I\u2019m still wondering if I should\u2019ve done more and cared more, and if she was right to call me out. My girlfriend thinks I did the right thing and so did my boss (who is an ex cop) but part of me still feels like Peter Parker letting the robber who then murdered his uncle get away. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is a guy sees a thief running off with a Salvation Army bucket, he grabs the guy but then lets him go. The thief ends up escaping with the money, and there's some confrontation with the two women. \n\nFirst, the author took some action. He physically stopped the thief initially, which shows he tried to intervene. But then he let the thief run off when the thief went for the bucket. The woman criticizes him for not stopping the thief, and the author is conflicted about whether he did the right thing.\n\nThe author mentions he's a bouncer with some martial arts training, so he's aware of potential danger. His reasoning for not stopping the thief was fear of getting hurt and the cost-benefit analysis of risking injury over $50. \n\nOn one hand, he did act initially, which is commendable. On the other hand, letting the thief go after engaging might be seen as not following through. But is that his fault? The question is whether he's in the wrong for letting the thief escape.\n\nThe woman who's going into the police academy is frustrated because she sees people not acting, but the author's decision was based on his judgment of safety. His girlfriend and his ex-cop boss support him. That's a point in his favor. Also, the thief was already fleeing, and the author might not have been in a position to safely pursue without risking harm to himself or others.\n\nIs there a duty to act here? Generally, in many places, there's no legal obligation to intervene unless you're a public safety official. So legally, he's probably not in the wrong. Morally, it's trickier. But he did act in the first place. Maybe he could have called the police instead, but he didn't mention that. However, the situation was unfolding quickly, and he might not have had time.\n\nThe key is whether his decision to let go was unreasonable. Considering his safety and the lack of legal duty, some might argue he's not wrong. Others might think he should have done more. But given the circumstances, he made a judgment call based on his training and the potential risks. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
