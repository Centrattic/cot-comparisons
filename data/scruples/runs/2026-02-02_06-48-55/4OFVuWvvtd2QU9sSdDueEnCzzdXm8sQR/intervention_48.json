As he runs by I grab him by the backpack strap and yank him, throwing him to the ground. The bucket rolled a few feet away. As he jumped up his attention was fixed on me, starting to rush me. I could tell he was willing to fight for the money instead of cutting his losses and running away. \n\nI took a step back to improve my range for a counter if needed (I am a bouncer and have a enough boxing and Jiu-Jitsu training to handle myself; not much but enough). He decided to just go for the bucket and run off instead of attacking me. \n\nI didn\u2019t stop him. \n\nI could have, maybe. But a few thoughts went through my head as soon as he went for the bucket instead of me. \n\u201cI won\u2019t have the element of surprise the second time\u201d\n\u201cThere are no other men around to help if things go bad.\u201d\nAnd\n\u201cBest case scenario: I\u2019m the hero for rescuing $50 worth of quarters that don\u2019t really belong to anyone except a massive non-profit.\u201d\n\u201cWorst case scenario: I get stabbed in front of my girlfriend for trying to rescue $50 worth of quarters.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t worth it. \nAnyways, back to the asshole part. The two women catch up as he runs off. The short overweight one sarcastically mentions something about what a Good Samaritan I was. I say \u201cexcuse me?\u201d hoping that I misread her tone. She then scoffs at me again blaming me for letting him get away. \n\nI reply stating that I wasn\u2019t going to risk getting stabbed over a few dollars. \n\nTo which she says \u201cthis is the reason I\u2019m going into the [police] academy! Because of guys like you not doing anything to help!\u201d \n\nI yell back \u201cFuck you!\u201d and nothing more. She didn\u2019t like that very much. She said \u201csay it again! I\u2019m on the phone with the cops!\u201d Which is when we decided to leave. \n\nThis happened last night and I\u2019m still wondering if I should\u2019ve done more and cared more, and if she was right to call me out. My girlfriend thinks I did the right thing and so did my boss (who is an ex cop) but part of me still feels like Peter Parker letting the robber who then murdered his uncle get away. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for letting a thief escape. The situation involves a Salvation Army bucket being stolen. The author, who's a bouncer with some training, stops the thief initially but lets him go when the thief decides to flee instead of fight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's reasoning. He was concerned about personal safety, especially the risk of getting hurt. He had already subdued the thief once, but when the thief went for the bucket again, he chose not to pursue. His girlfriend and boss, an ex-cop, support his decision. The other woman, possibly a police academy trainee, criticizes him, which adds emotional weight.\n\nNow, legal perspective: In many jurisdictions, there's a duty to intervene in crimes if you're a police officer, but civilians aren't required to. The author isn't a cop, so he's not obligated to chase a suspect beyond what he comfortably can. His safety is a valid concern here. Also, the Salvation Army bucket is a non-profit's property, so returning it is a good deed, but the value of $50 in quarters isn't life-threatening. \n\nMoral standpoint: Some might argue that doing nothing when you have the chance to help, even if it's a small amount, is wrong. Others would say prioritizing personal safety is responsible. The user mentions feeling like Peter Parker who let a robber go, leading to a tragedy. That analogy is heavy, but in reality, the stakes here are much lower. \n\nThe other woman's reaction is also important. She's in a position to become a police officer, so her frustration is understandable, but she's not in the situation. The author had to make a split-second decision, and he chose a non-violent approach. His boss, an ex-cop, agreeing with his decision adds credibility to his choice being reasonable.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. He made a rational decision based on self-preservation and the low value of the stolen property. The other woman's criticism is harsh, but the author's actions were within his rights and reasonable given the circumstances.\n"
