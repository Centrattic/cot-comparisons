As he runs by I grab him by the backpack strap and yank him, throwing him to the ground. The bucket rolled a few feet away. As he jumped up his attention was fixed on me, starting to rush me. I could tell he was willing to fight for the money instead of cutting his losses and running away. \n\nI took a step back to improve my range for a counter if needed (I am a bouncer and have a enough boxing and Jiu-Jitsu training to handle myself; not much but enough). He decided to just go for the bucket and run off instead of attacking me. \n\nI didn\u2019t stop him. \n\nI could have, maybe. But a few thoughts went through my head as soon as he went for the bucket instead of me. \n\u201cI won\u2019t have the element of surprise the second time\u201d\n\u201cThere are no other men around to help if things go bad.\u201d\nAnd\n\u201cBest case scenario: I\u2019m the hero for rescuing $50 worth of quarters that don\u2019t really belong to anyone except a massive non-profit.\u201d\n\u201cWorst case scenario: I get stabbed in front of my girlfriend for trying to rescue $50 worth of quarters.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t worth it. \nAnyways, back to the asshole part. The two women catch up as he runs off. The short overweight one sarcastically mentions something about what a Good Samaritan I was. I say \u201cexcuse me?\u201d hoping that I misread her tone. She then scoffs at me again blaming me for letting him get away. \n\nI reply stating that I wasn\u2019t going to risk getting stabbed over a few dollars. \n\nTo which she says \u201cthis is the reason I\u2019m going into the [police] academy! Because of guys like you not doing anything to help!\u201d \n\nI yell back \u201cFuck you!\u201d and nothing more. She didn\u2019t like that very much. She said \u201csay it again! I\u2019m on the phone with the cops!\u201d Which is when we decided to leave. \n\nThis happened last night and I\u2019m still wondering if I should\u2019ve done more and cared more, and if she was right to call me out. My girlfriend thinks I did the right thing and so did my boss (who is an ex cop) but part of me still feels like Peter Parker letting the robber who then murdered his uncle get away. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by breaking down the situation. The person was walking with their girlfriend when they saw a man running away with a Salvation Army bucket, chased by two women. One of them is an older woman from the Salvation Army, and the other is a short, overweight woman. The author grabs the man's backpack, yanks him, and throws him to the ground. The bucket rolls away. The man then gets up, looks like he might fight but instead goes for the bucket and runs off. The author doesn't chase him, considering the risk of getting hurt. The other woman criticizes the author, leading to an argument.\n\nThe author is a bouncer with some boxing and Jiu-Jitsu training, so they have some self-defense skills. Their reasoning is that the worst-case scenario is getting stabbed for $50, which isn't worth it. The girlfriend and the boss (ex-cop) support them, but the author feels guilty like Peter Parker letting a robber escape, leading to Uncle Ben's death.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key factors here are whether the author had a duty to intervene, the proportionality of their actions, and the potential consequences. \n\nFirst, the initial action: grabbing the man by the backpack and throwing him to the ground. At that point, the author physically intervened. That could be seen as a good first step. However, after the man gets up and chooses to flee with the bucket, the author decides not to pursue. The question is whether they should have continued to stop the thief or if they had a right to step back given the risk.\n\nThe author's justification is about self-preservation. They mention that they could have been hurt. The boss (ex-cop) agrees they did the right thing. The other woman, who seems to be a police academy recruit, is angry, suggesting the author should have done more. But is the author legally or morally obligated to stop a thief, especially when there's a risk of harm?\n\nLegally, a civilian doesn't have a duty to act in such situations unless there's a specific responsibility (like a parent-child relationship). However, if someone starts an intervention, they might be expected to follow through if they can do so safely. But once the situation escalates, it's often advised to call the police rather than take matters into one's own hands, especially when it could lead to violence.\n\nThe author's initial action might have been enough to stop the theft, but the thief escaped. The author is questioning if they should have kept going. The moral dilemma here is balancing personal safety against helping others. The author chose to prioritize their safety, which is understandable. However, some might argue that once you've intervened, you should see it through. Others would agree with the author's assessment that continuing could lead to harm and that calling the police would be better, but since the thief was already fleeing, the author might not have the means to stop him without risk.\n\nThe woman's reaction is harsh, but it's also possible she's projecting her own aspirations (becoming a cop) onto others. The author's response was defensive, which is natural. The girlfriend supports the author, which adds to the idea that their action was reasonable.\n\nIn summary, while the author took an initial step, they chose not to escalate the situation further. Given the risk of harm and the lack of legal obligation, their decision might be reasonable. However, some might argue that they should have done more to prevent the theft, even if it meant risking themselves. The answer likely depends on the balance of duty versus self-preservation.\n"
