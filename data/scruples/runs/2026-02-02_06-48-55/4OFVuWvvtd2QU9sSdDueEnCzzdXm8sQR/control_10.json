As he runs by I grab him by the backpack strap and yank him, throwing him to the ground. The bucket rolled a few feet away. As he jumped up his attention was fixed on me, starting to rush me. I could tell he was willing to fight for the money instead of cutting his losses and running away. \n\nI took a step back to improve my range for a counter if needed (I am a bouncer and have a enough boxing and Jiu-Jitsu training to handle myself; not much but enough). He decided to just go for the bucket and run off instead of attacking me. \n\nI didn\u2019t stop him. \n\nI could have, maybe. But a few thoughts went through my head as soon as he went for the bucket instead of me. \n\u201cI won\u2019t have the element of surprise the second time\u201d\n\u201cThere are no other men around to help if things go bad.\u201d\nAnd\n\u201cBest case scenario: I\u2019m the hero for rescuing $50 worth of quarters that don\u2019t really belong to anyone except a massive non-profit.\u201d\n\u201cWorst case scenario: I get stabbed in front of my girlfriend for trying to rescue $50 worth of quarters.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t worth it. \nAnyways, back to the asshole part. The two women catch up as he runs off. The short overweight one sarcastically mentions something about what a Good Samaritan I was. I say \u201cexcuse me?\u201d hoping that I misread her tone. She then scoffs at me again blaming me for letting him get away. \n\nI reply stating that I wasn\u2019t going to risk getting stabbed over a few dollars. \n\nTo which she says \u201cthis is the reason I\u2019m going into the [police] academy! Because of guys like you not doing anything to help!\u201d \n\nI yell back \u201cFuck you!\u201d and nothing more. She didn\u2019t like that very much. She said \u201csay it again! I\u2019m on the phone with the cops!\u201d Which is when we decided to leave. \n\nThis happened last night and I\u2019m still wondering if I should\u2019ve done more and cared more, and if she was right to call me out. My girlfriend thinks I did the right thing and so did my boss (who is an ex cop) but part of me still feels like Peter Parker letting the robber who then murdered his uncle get away. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for letting a thief run off with a Salvation Army bucket after initially grabbing him. The situation involves a theft, the author's response, and some conflict with the other woman.\n\nFirst, the author intervened by grabbing the thief, but let him go after he chose to flee with the bucket. The author explains that he considered the risks of confronting the thief further, especially given the possibility of being harmed. He's a bouncer with some training, but he decided not to pursue because he didn't want to risk injury for a relatively small amount of money.\n\nThe other woman was critical, implying that he should have done more. The girlfriend and the boss (a former cop) support him. The author is conflicted, comparing himself to Peter Parker's guilt over Uncle Ben's death.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. Legally, he initially stopped the thief, which could be justified as preventing a crime. However, once he let go, he didn't continue pursuit. The key points are his assessment of personal safety versus property value. The money wasn't for a critical cause, and the risk of harm to himself was significant. The other woman's criticism might be valid in a moral sense, but the author's decision to prioritize his safety could be seen as reasonable, especially since he did stop the thief briefly.\n\nMoral judgment is subjective here. The author took action initially, which the thief then escalated by trying to fight. Letting go after the thief changed tactics might be justifiable. The ex-cop boss's support suggests that from a law enforcement perspective, the risk wasn't worth the reward. So, the answer is likely B (No), he's not in the wrong.\n"
