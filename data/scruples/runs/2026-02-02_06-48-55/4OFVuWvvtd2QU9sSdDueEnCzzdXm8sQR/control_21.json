As he runs by I grab him by the backpack strap and yank him, throwing him to the ground. The bucket rolled a few feet away. As he jumped up his attention was fixed on me, starting to rush me. I could tell he was willing to fight for the money instead of cutting his losses and running away. \n\nI took a step back to improve my range for a counter if needed (I am a bouncer and have a enough boxing and Jiu-Jitsu training to handle myself; not much but enough). He decided to just go for the bucket and run off instead of attacking me. \n\nI didn\u2019t stop him. \n\nI could have, maybe. But a few thoughts went through my head as soon as he went for the bucket instead of me. \n\u201cI won\u2019t have the element of surprise the second time\u201d\n\u201cThere are no other men around to help if things go bad.\u201d\nAnd\n\u201cBest case scenario: I\u2019m the hero for rescuing $50 worth of quarters that don\u2019t really belong to anyone except a massive non-profit.\u201d\n\u201cWorst case scenario: I get stabbed in front of my girlfriend for trying to rescue $50 worth of quarters.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t worth it. \nAnyways, back to the asshole part. The two women catch up as he runs off. The short overweight one sarcastically mentions something about what a Good Samaritan I was. I say \u201cexcuse me?\u201d hoping that I misread her tone. She then scoffs at me again blaming me for letting him get away. \n\nI reply stating that I wasn\u2019t going to risk getting stabbed over a few dollars. \n\nTo which she says \u201cthis is the reason I\u2019m going into the [police] academy! Because of guys like you not doing anything to help!\u201d \n\nI yell back \u201cFuck you!\u201d and nothing more. She didn\u2019t like that very much. She said \u201csay it again! I\u2019m on the phone with the cops!\u201d Which is when we decided to leave. \n\nThis happened last night and I\u2019m still wondering if I should\u2019ve done more and cared more, and if she was right to call me out. My girlfriend thinks I did the right thing and so did my boss (who is an ex cop) but part of me still feels like Peter Parker letting the robber who then murdered his uncle get away. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully. \n\nThe author and their girlfriend were walking to the grocery store from Goodwill. They see a guy running with a Salvation Army bucket, and two women chasing him\u2014one is a bell ringer, the other is described as short and overweight. The author grabs the guy by his backpack strap and yanks him, causing him to fall. The bucket rolls away. The guy then tries to rush the author, but the author steps back. The guy decides to go for the bucket and run off. The author doesn't stop him, thinking about the risks involved\u2014like not having the element of surprise, no help around, and the potential for getting hurt. They mention their training as a bouncer and in boxing/Jiu-Jitsu but decide it's not worth the risk. \n\nThe other woman is sarcastic, calls the author out for not helping, and the author responds that they didn't want to risk getting stabbed over a few dollars. The woman mentions she's going into the police academy because of people like the author. The author gets angry, yells \"fuck you,\" and they leave. The girlfriend and the boss (ex-cop) support the author's decision, but they feel guilty, comparing themselves to Peter Parker letting Uncle Ben get killed.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The key points are: the author intervened initially by tackling the thief, which suggests they tried to stop the theft. Then, when the thief turned to run instead of fighting, the author chose not to pursue further. The reasoning given is the risk of personal harm and the low value of the stolen property.\n\nFirst, the author did take action to stop the theft by grabbing the thief. That shows they tried to help. However, when the thief tried to run, the author didn't chase. The question is whether they should have. The author's boss, an ex-cop, supports their decision, which adds weight to the idea that they made a reasonable choice given the circumstances. The author also considered the risk of harm to themselves. \n\nThe law often doesn't require you to put yourself in danger to prevent a crime, especially if you're not a law enforcement officer. The concept of \"duty to intervene\" isn't universal; many jurisdictions don't require bystanders to act unless there's a special relationship or duty. The author isn't a cop, so their responsibility is different. \n\nThe other woman's reaction seems harsh, but the author's judgment that the risk wasn't worth it might be reasonable. The value of the money is low ($50 in quarters), and the potential for violence is high. The author's training gives them some ability to handle themselves, but even trained individuals might avoid a no-win situation. \n\nThe comparison to Peter Parker is emotional, but in reality, Uncle Ben's death was due to a failure to stop a real threat (a burglar), but this situation is different. The author did take action initially but faced a choice between a low-value item and personal safety. Given the risk-benefit analysis, their decision might be justified. \n\nSo, considering all factors\u2014the initial intervention, the risk assessment, the advice from the ex-cop boss, and the lack of legal obligation to intervene beyond a certain point\u2014it seems the author isn't in the wrong. Their decision was based on practicality and self-preservation, which are valid considerations.\n"
