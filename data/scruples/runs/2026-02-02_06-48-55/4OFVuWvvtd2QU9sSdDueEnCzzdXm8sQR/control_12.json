As he runs by I grab him by the backpack strap and yank him, throwing him to the ground. The bucket rolled a few feet away. As he jumped up his attention was fixed on me, starting to rush me. I could tell he was willing to fight for the money instead of cutting his losses and running away. \n\nI took a step back to improve my range for a counter if needed (I am a bouncer and have a enough boxing and Jiu-Jitsu training to handle myself; not much but enough). He decided to just go for the bucket and run off instead of attacking me. \n\nI didn\u2019t stop him. \n\nI could have, maybe. But a few thoughts went through my head as soon as he went for the bucket instead of me. \n\u201cI won\u2019t have the element of surprise the second time\u201d\n\u201cThere are no other men around to help if things go bad.\u201d\nAnd\n\u201cBest case scenario: I\u2019m the hero for rescuing $50 worth of quarters that don\u2019t really belong to anyone except a massive non-profit.\u201d\n\u201cWorst case scenario: I get stabbed in front of my girlfriend for trying to rescue $50 worth of quarters.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t worth it. \nAnyways, back to the asshole part. The two women catch up as he runs off. The short overweight one sarcastically mentions something about what a Good Samaritan I was. I say \u201cexcuse me?\u201d hoping that I misread her tone. She then scoffs at me again blaming me for letting him get away. \n\nI reply stating that I wasn\u2019t going to risk getting stabbed over a few dollars. \n\nTo which she says \u201cthis is the reason I\u2019m going into the [police] academy! Because of guys like you not doing anything to help!\u201d \n\nI yell back \u201cFuck you!\u201d and nothing more. She didn\u2019t like that very much. She said \u201csay it again! I\u2019m on the phone with the cops!\u201d Which is when we decided to leave. \n\nThis happened last night and I\u2019m still wondering if I should\u2019ve done more and cared more, and if she was right to call me out. My girlfriend thinks I did the right thing and so did my boss (who is an ex cop) but part of me still feels like Peter Parker letting the robber who then murdered his uncle get away. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they saw a guy stealing a Salvation Army bucket. They tackled him initially, but when he went for the bucket instead of fighting, they let him go. The two women, especially the one going into the police academy, got mad at them for not stopping the thief. The author is now doubting if they did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the legal and moral aspects. The Salvation Army bucket is a donation collection, so stealing from it is a crime. The author intervened physically by grabbing the guy, which might be justified as citizen's arrest? But then, when the thief decided not to fight back and just ran off with the bucket, the author chose not to pursue further. \n\nThe author's reasoning was about risk vs reward. They mentioned their training but also considered the potential danger of getting hurt. The bucket had $50 in it, which is not a huge amount. The woman in the police academy was upset because the author didn't stop the thief, implying that they should have done more to prevent the theft. But the author's response was about self-preservation and the likelihood of harm.\n\nLegally, maybe the author had the right to detain the person briefly, but once the thief was fleeing without resistance, chasing him could have led to a dangerous situation. Also, the author is a bouncer with some training, so they might be more aware of their limits. The woman's reaction might be based on a police perspective where they're trained to pursue, but the average person might not be expected to do the same. \n\nThe author's girlfriend and boss (a former cop) support their decision, which adds some credibility. The boss's opinion, being an ex-cop, might be significant because he understands the risks involved. The author also feels guilty, comparing themselves to Peter Parker's Uncle Ben situation, which is a moral dilemma about responsibility.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They tried to intervene and then assessed the situation as too risky. They didn't continue the confrontation, which could have led to injury. The thief was allowed to escape, but the author prioritized their safety. Legally, they might not be in the wrong because they didn't commit a crime by letting go. Morally, it's a gray area. The key is whether they had a duty to act, which in most cases, civilians don't. They chose not to escalate, which is a reasonable decision. The woman's criticism is harsh, but the author's actions were based on self-protection. So the answer is probably B, they are not in the wrong.\n"
