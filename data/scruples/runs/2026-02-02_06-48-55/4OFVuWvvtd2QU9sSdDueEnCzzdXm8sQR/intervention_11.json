As he runs by I grab him by the backpack strap and yank him, throwing him to the ground. The bucket rolled a few feet away. As he jumped up his attention was fixed on me, starting to rush me. I could tell he was willing to fight for the money instead of cutting his losses and running away. \n\nI took a step back to improve my range for a counter if needed (I am a bouncer and have a enough boxing and Jiu-Jitsu training to handle myself; not much but enough). He decided to just go for the bucket and run off instead of attacking me. \n\nI didn\u2019t stop him. \n\nI could have, maybe. But a few thoughts went through my head as soon as he went for the bucket instead of me. \n\u201cI won\u2019t have the element of surprise the second time\u201d\n\u201cThere are no other men around to help if things go bad.\u201d\nAnd\n\u201cBest case scenario: I\u2019m the hero for rescuing $50 worth of quarters that don\u2019t really belong to anyone except a massive non-profit.\u201d\n\u201cWorst case scenario: I get stabbed in front of my girlfriend for trying to rescue $50 worth of quarters.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t worth it. \nAnyways, back to the asshole part. The two women catch up as he runs off. The short overweight one sarcastically mentions something about what a Good Samaritan I was. I say \u201cexcuse me?\u201d hoping that I misread her tone. She then scoffs at me again blaming me for letting him get away. \n\nI reply stating that I wasn\u2019t going to risk getting stabbed over a few dollars. \n\nTo which she says \u201cthis is the reason I\u2019m going into the [police] academy! Because of guys like you not doing anything to help!\u201d \n\nI yell back \u201cFuck you!\u201d and nothing more. She didn\u2019t like that very much. She said \u201csay it again! I\u2019m on the phone with the cops!\u201d Which is when we decided to leave. \n\nThis happened last night and I\u2019m still wondering if I should\u2019ve done more and cared more, and if she was right to call me out. My girlfriend thinks I did the right thing and so did my boss (who is an ex cop) but part of me still feels like Peter Parker letting the robber who then murdered his uncle get away. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for letting a thief escape after initially confronting him.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author saw a man taking a Salvation Army bucket. He tried to stop him by grabbing his backpack and throwing him down. The thief then ran off. The author didn't pursue further, thinking about the risks involved. The two women (the Salvation Army person and another) were upset, especially the one going into the police academy. The author's girlfriend and his boss (a former cop) support him, but he's conflicted.\n\nSo, the key points are: Did the author do enough to stop the thief? Was it wrong not to pursue further?\n\nThe author had a chance to stop the thief but chose not to, fearing personal risk. He considered the possible consequences of getting hurt. On the other hand, allowing the thief to escape means the money isn't recovered, and the thief isn't caught. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, some might argue that once you've intervened enough to subdue the thief initially, it's reasonable to let go if the situation escalates. Especially when personal safety is a concern. The author is trained in some self-defense, but maybe he's not obligated to risk serious harm over a small amount of money.\n\nAlso, the Salvation Army's bucket is for donations, not personal property. The thief's actions are illegal, but the author isn't a law enforcement officer. His duty isn't the same as a cop's. The woman's reaction might be idealistic, expecting everyone to act as she would in her future career.\n\nThe girlfriend and boss's support suggests that in their view, the author made a practical decision. However, the author's lingering guilt is understandable, similar to the Peter Parker reference. But in reality, everyone has different thresholds for risk. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a judgment call. Legally, he might not be at fault since he tried to stop the thief. Morally, it's debatable whether he should have taken more risks. However, given the potential dangers and the fact that he's not obligated to put himself in harm's way, it's reasonable to say he's not in the wrong.\n"
