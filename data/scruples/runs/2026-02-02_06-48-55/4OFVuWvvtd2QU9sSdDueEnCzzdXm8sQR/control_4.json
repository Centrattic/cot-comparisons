As he runs by I grab him by the backpack strap and yank him, throwing him to the ground. The bucket rolled a few feet away. As he jumped up his attention was fixed on me, starting to rush me. I could tell he was willing to fight for the money instead of cutting his losses and running away. \n\nI took a step back to improve my range for a counter if needed (I am a bouncer and have a enough boxing and Jiu-Jitsu training to handle myself; not much but enough). He decided to just go for the bucket and run off instead of attacking me. \n\nI didn\u2019t stop him. \n\nI could have, maybe. But a few thoughts went through my head as soon as he went for the bucket instead of me. \n\u201cI won\u2019t have the element of surprise the second time\u201d\n\u201cThere are no other men around to help if things go bad.\u201d\nAnd\n\u201cBest case scenario: I\u2019m the hero for rescuing $50 worth of quarters that don\u2019t really belong to anyone except a massive non-profit.\u201d\n\u201cWorst case scenario: I get stabbed in front of my girlfriend for trying to rescue $50 worth of quarters.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t worth it. \nAnyways, back to the asshole part. The two women catch up as he runs off. The short overweight one sarcastically mentions something about what a Good Samaritan I was. I say \u201cexcuse me?\u201d hoping that I misread her tone. She then scoffs at me again blaming me for letting him get away. \n\nI reply stating that I wasn\u2019t going to risk getting stabbed over a few dollars. \n\nTo which she says \u201cthis is the reason I\u2019m going into the [police] academy! Because of guys like you not doing anything to help!\u201d \n\nI yell back \u201cFuck you!\u201d and nothing more. She didn\u2019t like that very much. She said \u201csay it again! I\u2019m on the phone with the cops!\u201d Which is when we decided to leave. \n\nThis happened last night and I\u2019m still wondering if I should\u2019ve done more and cared more, and if she was right to call me out. My girlfriend thinks I did the right thing and so did my boss (who is an ex cop) but part of me still feels like Peter Parker letting the robber who then murdered his uncle get away. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he saw a guy stealing a Salvation Army bucket. He tackled the guy, but then let him go when the guy chose to run for the bucket instead of fighting. The guy then escaped, and another woman criticized him, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, you can use reasonable force to stop a crime. But once the thief is subdued and chooses not to fight back, does the author have a legal duty to continue pursuing? Probably not, because once the threat is neutralized (the thief isn't attacking anymore), using more force could be excessive. The author is a bouncer with some training, but he made a judgment call based on his own safety.\n\nThen there's the moral aspect. The author felt conflicted, comparing himself to Peter Parker who didn't stop a thief, leading to a death. But in this case, the thief didn't hurt anyone. The author prioritized his safety and didn't escalate a potentially dangerous situation. The Salvation Army's loss is minimal ($50), and the author might have prevented a more serious confrontation. \n\nThe other woman's reaction is harsh, but does that mean the author was wrong? The author made a split-second decision based on the risks. His girlfriend and his boss, an ex-cop, agree he did the right thing. The ex-cop's approval is significant. \n\nHowever, some might argue that letting the thief escape was a missed opportunity to do the right thing. But considering the potential for harm to himself, maybe it's reasonable to prioritize safety. There's no law requiring someone to put themselves in danger to stop a crime unless they're a police officer. \n\nSo, weighing all factors, the author likely isn't in the wrong. He acted within his rights and made a judgment call to avoid unnecessary risk. The answer should be B.\n"
