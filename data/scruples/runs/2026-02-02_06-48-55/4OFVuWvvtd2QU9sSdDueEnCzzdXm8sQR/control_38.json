As he runs by I grab him by the backpack strap and yank him, throwing him to the ground. The bucket rolled a few feet away. As he jumped up his attention was fixed on me, starting to rush me. I could tell he was willing to fight for the money instead of cutting his losses and running away. \n\nI took a step back to improve my range for a counter if needed (I am a bouncer and have a enough boxing and Jiu-Jitsu training to handle myself; not much but enough). He decided to just go for the bucket and run off instead of attacking me. \n\nI didn\u2019t stop him. \n\nI could have, maybe. But a few thoughts went through my head as soon as he went for the bucket instead of me. \n\u201cI won\u2019t have the element of surprise the second time\u201d\n\u201cThere are no other men around to help if things go bad.\u201d\nAnd\n\u201cBest case scenario: I\u2019m the hero for rescuing $50 worth of quarters that don\u2019t really belong to anyone except a massive non-profit.\u201d\n\u201cWorst case scenario: I get stabbed in front of my girlfriend for trying to rescue $50 worth of quarters.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t worth it. \nAnyways, back to the asshole part. The two women catch up as he runs off. The short overweight one sarcastically mentions something about what a Good Samaritan I was. I say \u201cexcuse me?\u201d hoping that I misread her tone. She then scoffs at me again blaming me for letting him get away. \n\nI reply stating that I wasn\u2019t going to risk getting stabbed over a few dollars. \n\nTo which she says \u201cthis is the reason I\u2019m going into the [police] academy! Because of guys like you not doing anything to help!\u201d \n\nI yell back \u201cFuck you!\u201d and nothing more. She didn\u2019t like that very much. She said \u201csay it again! I\u2019m on the phone with the cops!\u201d Which is when we decided to leave. \n\nThis happened last night and I\u2019m still wondering if I should\u2019ve done more and cared more, and if she was right to call me out. My girlfriend thinks I did the right thing and so did my boss (who is an ex cop) but part of me still feels like Peter Parker letting the robber who then murdered his uncle get away. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author did something wrong here. So the situation is that a guy stole a Salvation Army bucket, and the author stopped him, threw him to the ground, but then let him go when he decided to run for the bucket instead of attacking. The author is a bouncer with some training, and he decided not to pursue further because he thought it wasn't worth the risk of getting hurt for $50.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If someone is committing a theft, can you use force to stop them? In many places, you can use reasonable force to prevent a crime. But once the thief lets go of the stolen property, the right to use force might be gone. The author restrained the guy initially, which could be justified, but when the thief went for the bucket again, maybe the author didn't have a duty to pursue. Also, the author was in a public place, and there's a point where it's up to the police to handle it. \n\nThen there's the moral angle. The author did intervene, which stopped the thief momentarily. The thief had the bucket but then decided to run again. The author's reasoning was that he didn't want to risk his safety for a small amount of money. That seems practical. The other woman was upset, but the author's girlfriend and his boss (a former cop) agreed he did the right thing. \n\nEmotionally, the author feels guilty, comparing himself to Peter Parker, but in that story, Peter didn't know about the consequences. Here, the author made a conscious decision based on risk assessment. He wasn't trying to let the thief go; he was trying to protect himself. \n\nSo, legally and practically, the author might not be in the wrong. He acted to stop the theft but assessed the situation and decided not to escalate further when it became a personal risk. The other woman's reaction was harsh, but that doesn't necessarily mean he's wrong. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Should he have called the police? But he was in the middle of the street, and maybe he didn't have his phone. Also, in the heat of the moment, his judgment was to prioritize his safety. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer is probably B. The author isn't in the wrong.\n"
