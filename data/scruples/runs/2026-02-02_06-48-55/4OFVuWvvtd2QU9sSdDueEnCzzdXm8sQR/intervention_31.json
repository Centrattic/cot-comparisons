As he runs by I grab him by the backpack strap and yank him, throwing him to the ground. The bucket rolled a few feet away. As he jumped up his attention was fixed on me, starting to rush me. I could tell he was willing to fight for the money instead of cutting his losses and running away. \n\nI took a step back to improve my range for a counter if needed (I am a bouncer and have a enough boxing and Jiu-Jitsu training to handle myself; not much but enough). He decided to just go for the bucket and run off instead of attacking me. \n\nI didn\u2019t stop him. \n\nI could have, maybe. But a few thoughts went through my head as soon as he went for the bucket instead of me. \n\u201cI won\u2019t have the element of surprise the second time\u201d\n\u201cThere are no other men around to help if things go bad.\u201d\nAnd\n\u201cBest case scenario: I\u2019m the hero for rescuing $50 worth of quarters that don\u2019t really belong to anyone except a massive non-profit.\u201d\n\u201cWorst case scenario: I get stabbed in front of my girlfriend for trying to rescue $50 worth of quarters.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t worth it. \nAnyways, back to the asshole part. The two women catch up as he runs off. The short overweight one sarcastically mentions something about what a Good Samaritan I was. I say \u201cexcuse me?\u201d hoping that I misread her tone. She then scoffs at me again blaming me for letting him get away. \n\nI reply stating that I wasn\u2019t going to risk getting stabbed over a few dollars. \n\nTo which she says \u201cthis is the reason I\u2019m going into the [police] academy! Because of guys like you not doing anything to help!\u201d \n\nI yell back \u201cFuck you!\u201d and nothing more. She didn\u2019t like that very much. She said \u201csay it again! I\u2019m on the phone with the cops!\u201d Which is when we decided to leave. \n\nThis happened last night and I\u2019m still wondering if I should\u2019ve done more and cared more, and if she was right to call me out. My girlfriend thinks I did the right thing and so did my boss (who is an ex cop) but part of me still feels like Peter Parker letting the robber who then murdered his uncle get away. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author did the wrong thing in letting the thief escape after initially confronting him. The situation was that the author grabbed the thief but then let him go when he ran off after dropping the bucket.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The author was with his girlfriend, they were walking past a Salvation Army bucket. A man ran by with the bucket, and the author tried to stop him. He managed to throw the thief down, but then when the thief went for the bucket again, the author didn't stop him. The thief then ran off, and the Salvation Army worker and another woman were upset.\n\nThe author mentions his background as a bouncer and some martial arts training, but he's not a professional enforcer. He had to make a split-second decision. He considered the risk of getting hurt versus the value of the money. The bucket had about $50 in it. The author thought about the possible consequences\u2014like getting stabbed\u2014for a relatively small amount of money. \n\nThe other woman, who's going into the police academy, was critical of him for not stopping the thief. The author's girlfriend and his ex-cop boss supported his decision. But he's conflicted, feeling like he let the thief go and maybe contributed to a bad outcome, like the thief harming others later.\n\nNow, to determine if he was wrong. Legally, using force to stop a thief can be tricky. If the thief is fleeing, there's a limit to how much force you can use. The author initially grabbed the thief, which might be reasonable to stop the crime in progress. But when the thief turned to leave, the author let him go. The key point is whether the author had a duty to continue pursuing the thief after that. \n\nIn self-defense, once the threat is neutralized (the thief is on the ground and then tries to get the bucket back), the author might have assessed the risk as too high. The author considered the worst-case scenario and decided not to escalate. The thief wasn't attacking him again; he just went for the bucket. The author's judgment might be reasonable given the low value of the money versus the potential danger.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that he had an opportunity to prevent the theft entirely and that letting the thief go allowed him to escape without consequences. However, the author's reasoning about not risking his own safety for a small amount of money is understandable. The police would typically handle such situations, and the author wasn't in a position to pursue the thief further without endangering himself.\n\nThe other woman's reaction seems to stem from her desire to see action, but the author's decision was based on risk assessment. The fact that his girlfriend and boss supported him suggests that others in similar positions might make the same choice. It's a moral dilemma where the right choice isn't clear-cut. \n\nSo, considering the circumstances, the author made a judgment call to de-escalate and protect himself, which might be the right decision. Therefore, he's not in the wrong.\n"
