      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who started the post (AITA) is in the wrong for not wanting his wife's date of birth tattooed on him. The tattoo is meant to represent his lineage, with his parents, himself, and his daughter in Roman numerals, ordered from oldest to youngest. His wife was upset that her DOB wasn't included, and his mother sided with her, suggesting that their daughter is a product of both of them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The original plan was to show lineage, which typically refers to direct descendants. The wife's DOB isn't part of the person's own lineage but rather the lineage of the family as a whole. However, the wife might have felt that since she's the mother of the daughter, her inclusion is necessary. The husband's mother also took her side, implying that the daughter comes from both parents, so the wife's DOB should be included as part of the family tree.\n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. The husband mentioned he was \"using it to show my lineage\" which he clarifies as direct descendants. However, it's possible the wife and her mother interpreted this as a family tree, which would include both spouses. The husband might not have communicated clearly enough that this was strictly his personal lineage, not the entire family's. The wife's surprise and the mother's support suggest there was a misunderstanding.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the husband's intention was clear to him, but if he didn't adequately explain it to his wife and mother, leading to their confusion and hurt feelings, then he might share some responsibility. On the other hand, the wife might have assumed her inclusion was necessary without being asked, but it's also reasonable for her to feel her role as a parent is significant enough to be represented. The husband's mother's stance adds another layer, possibly pressuring the situation.\n\nConsidering all this, it seems like the husband's lack of clear communication led to the conflict. While his intention was valid (showing his direct lineage), not including the wife's DOB might be seen as excluding a parent of the child, which could be hurtful. Therefore, the husband might be in the wrong for not discussing the design more thoroughly with his wife to align expectations and for not considering her perspective as the mother of their child.\n"
