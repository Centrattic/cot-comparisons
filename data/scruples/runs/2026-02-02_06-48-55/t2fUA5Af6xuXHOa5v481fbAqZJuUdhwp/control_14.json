      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted the AITA question is in the wrong for not including his wife's date of birth in a tattoo that includes his parents, himself, and their daughter. The tattoo is meant to represent his lineage.\n\nFirst, the author's intention was to show his direct lineage from his parents through himself to their daughter. He mentioned that the design uses Roman numerals stacked from oldest to youngest. The wife expected her DOB to be included, which the author didn't plan for. His mother side with the wife, arguing that the daughter is a product of both parents. Now, the author is second-guessing the tattoo because of this conflict.\n\nSo, the key points are: the author's stated purpose was lineage, which typically refers to direct descendants. The wife's DOB isn't part of the author's lineage but of her own. However, the wife felt excluded, and the mother's argument implies that the daughter's existence is a joint result, so maybe the wife's role is important. But the author's design was about his lineage, not the family tree in general. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Probably not. He was clear about his intention, and lineage usually doesn't include a spouse. The wife's expectation might stem from a different perspective, thinking the tattoo represents the family unit, not just the author's line. The mother's input might have added pressure, but if the author communicated his purpose beforehand, he's not at fault. The confusion came from differing expectations, not the author's wrongdoing. So the answer is B.\n"
