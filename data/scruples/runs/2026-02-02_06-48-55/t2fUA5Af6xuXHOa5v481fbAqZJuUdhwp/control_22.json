      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a tattoo design that includes the birth dates of his parents, himself, and daughter in Roman numerals, stacked from oldest to youngest. The wife expected her birth date to be included and was upset when it wasn't. His mother also sided with the wife, thinking the daughter is a product of both parents.\n\nFirst, the author's intention was to show his lineage through his direct descendants. He clearly stated the design was for his lineage, which typically refers to one's own ancestry and descendants. The wife's expectation might have been based on a different interpretation, perhaps thinking family tree includes both spouses. However, lineage usually refers to the direct line of descent from parent to child. The author's mother supporting the wife might be confusing lineage with a family tree, which includes siblings and spouses. \n\nThe author didn't mention the tattoo being a family tree, so maybe there was a miscommunication. But since he explicitly said it was lineage, which is different, he might not be in the wrong. The wife's reaction could stem from feeling excluded, but the author's design was based on his own family line. The fact that he's having second thoughts shows he's considering the implications. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Probably not. The key points are his stated intent and the definition of lineage. Unless he promised to include her, which he didn't, he isn't wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
