My Parents &gt; Me&gt; My Daughter in Roman numerals stacked oldest to youngest, bottom to top.  \n\nFor some reason my wife thought that her DOB would be included in this tattoo and was shocked and upset her DOB was not included.  To make the situation worse, my mother (who has no tattoos) sided with my wife under the idea that our daughter was a product of both my wife and I.    I don\u2019t know if they are confusing the idea with family tree despite me saying I was using it to show my lineage or direct descendants.\n\nAITA for not wanting my wife\u2019s dob on my body / changing the design of the tattoo.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a tattoo that the author wanted to represent his lineage, including his parents, himself, and their daughter. The wife was upset that her birthday wasn't included, and the author's mother supported the wife's position. The author now is questioning if he's wrong for not including the wife.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations here. The author clearly stated that the tattoo was meant to show his lineage, which he defined as his parents, himself, and their daughter. The wife thought her birthday should be included, but the author didn't see it that way. The key point is whether the author was wrong in excluding the wife's DOB on his tattoo.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he might see the tattoo as a personal expression of his family line. However, the wife's reaction suggests she felt her role in their daughter's life was being acknowledged in the tattoo. The author's mother agreeing with the wife adds pressure. The author's hesitation now might stem from the conflict rather than the design itself.\n\nI should consider if the author failed to communicate his intent clearly. He mentioned he said it was about his lineage, but maybe the wife didn't interpret it the same way. The author's focus on lineage vs. family tree might be a technical point that the wife didn't grasp. Did the author make sure the wife understood the design's purpose? If not, his lack of clear communication could be a problem. However, if he did explain and she still had different expectations, maybe he's not in the wrong for sticking to his original plan.\n\nAlso, the tattoo is on the author's body, so he has the right to decide what's included. But the wife's feelings are valid. The author might have overlooked her perspective. The fact that the mother sided with the wife could indicate that the wife's viewpoint is more socially expected in terms of family representation. However, the author's intent was clear, so maybe it's not entirely his fault. The answer might hinge on whether the author adequately discussed the design with his wife beforehand. If he didn't, then he's at fault. If he did, then it's the wife's misunderstanding.\n"
