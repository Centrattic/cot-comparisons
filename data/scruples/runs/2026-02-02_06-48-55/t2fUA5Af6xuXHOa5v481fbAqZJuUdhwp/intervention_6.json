To make the situation worse, my mother (who has no tattoos) sided with my wife under the idea that our daughter was a product of both my wife and I.    I don\u2019t know if they are confusing the idea with family tree despite me saying I was using it to show my lineage or direct descendants.\n\nAITA for not wanting my wife\u2019s dob on my body / changing the design of the tattoo.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to include his wife's date of birth in a tattoo that shows his lineage. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author plans a tattoo with Roman numerals representing his parents, himself, and his daughter. His wife expected her DOB to be included, but the author didn't think of it that way. The wife and mother are upset, arguing that the daughter is a product of both parents, so the wife's DOB should be there.\n\nHmm, so the author's reasoning is about his lineage, which he defines as parents, himself, and daughter. The wife might feel excluded because her role in creating the daughter is significant. The author didn't consider her perspective, maybe assuming lineage is only about the male line. But the daughter's existence comes from both parents, so her exclusion might seem unfair to the wife.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he didn't communicate clearly. He thought he was clear about it being his lineage, but the wife still expected her DOB. Maybe he should have discussed the design more thoroughly with her beforehand. The fact that his mother sided with the wife might add pressure, but the key point is mutual understanding. The author's decision might overlook the collaborative nature of parenthood, which the wife could see as her being left out. So, the answer might be A, he is in the wrong for not considering her feelings and not ensuring communication.\n"
