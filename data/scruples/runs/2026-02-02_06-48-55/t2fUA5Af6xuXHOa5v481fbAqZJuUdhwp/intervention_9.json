My Parents &gt; Me&gt; My Daughter in Roman numerals stacked oldest to youngest, bottom to top.  \n\nFor some reason my wife thought that her DOB would be included in this tattoo and was shocked and upset her DOB was not included.  To make the situation worse, my mother (who has no tattoos) sided with my wife under the idea that our daughter was a product of both my wife and I.    I don\u2019t know if they are confusing the idea with family tree despite me saying I was using it to show my lineage or direct descendants.\n\nAITA for not wanting my wife\u2019s dob on my body / changing the design of the tattoo.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to include his wife's date of birth in a tattoo that's supposed to represent his lineage.\n\nFirst, the tattoo design is meant to show his lineage from parents to him to his daughter using Roman numerals. The wife thought her DOB would be included, but the author didn't plan to add it. The wife is upset because she feels excluded, and the mother sides with the wife, arguing that the daughter is a product of both parents. The author is now doubting if he's wrong.\n\nI need to consider communication. The author mentioned the design was about his lineage, but maybe he didn't clearly explain that it's his direct descendants, not the family tree including his spouse. The wife's assumption might stem from not understanding the design's intent. However, the author should have clarified if there was any ambiguity. On the other hand, the wife might have a right to feel left out, especially if she thought it was part of the family aspect. The mother's input adds another layer, suggesting societal expectations of joint parenthood. But the author's tattoo is personal, so including the wife's DOB might not be necessary from his perspective. Still, failing to communicate clearly could make the author at fault. So maybe the answer is A, but I need to be sure.\n"
