My Parents &gt; Me&gt; My Daughter in Roman numerals stacked oldest to youngest, bottom to top.  \n\nFor some reason my wife thought that her DOB would be included in this tattoo and was shocked and upset her DOB was not included.  To make the situation worse, my mother (who has no tattoos) sided with my wife under the idea that our daughter was a product of both my wife and I.    I don\u2019t know if they are confusing the idea with family tree despite me saying I was using it to show my lineage or direct descendants.\n\nAITA for not wanting my wife\u2019s dob on my body / changing the design of the tattoo. Cuse I\u2019m having serious second thoughts about getting it done.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to include his wife's date of birth in a tattoo. The author designed the tattoo to show his lineage with his parents, himself, and daughter in Roman numerals. The wife was upset her DOB wasn't included, and the author's mother agreed she should be part of it. The author is now considering changing the design.\n\nHmm. So, first, the author's intention was to show his lineage, which is his direct descendants. The wife's DOB isn't part of his lineage but rather his family tree as a spouse. The author explained this, but the wife and mother still feel it's important for her to be included. Is the author wrong for not including her?\n\nWell, the tattoo is on his body, so he has the right to decide what's on it. However, the wife felt left out, which might affect their relationship. The author might have failed to communicate clearly that the design was about lineage, not the entire family. Maybe he should have considered her feelings more, even if the design was technically correct. But the question is if he's in the wrong. \n\nFrom a rights perspective, he's not in the wrong because it's his tattoo. But in terms of relationship dynamics, he might have been negligent in considering her feelings. However, the story says he explained the idea, so if he did that, he's not entirely at fault. The mother siding with the wife complicates things, but the author's decision is his to make. So maybe B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
