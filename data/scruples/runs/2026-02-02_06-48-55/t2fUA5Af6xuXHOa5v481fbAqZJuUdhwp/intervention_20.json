      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a tattoo that includes dates of birth for the author's parents, himself, and his daughter, arranged to show lineage. The wife was upset that her DOB wasn't included, and the author's mother also sided with the wife, thinking the daughter is a product of both parents.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's reasoning. He designed the tattoo to represent his lineage, which he defines as parents, himself, and his child. That makes sense from a genetic or direct descent perspective. However, the wife felt excluded because she's part of the family, and the mother-in-law agreed, emphasizing that the daughter is a result of both parents. \n\nThe key points here are about expectations and communication. The author mentioned he intended it as lineage, which typically refers to direct bloodline. But maybe the wife and mother saw it as a family tree, which would include spouses. The author didn't include the wife's DOB, which could be seen as overlooking her role in their daughter's life. Even if lineage is technically about direct descendants, family dynamics might view the spouse as equally important in the family structure.\n\nCommunication seems to be an issue here. If the author didn't clearly convey that the tattoo is strictly about lineage (not a family tree), the wife could have a reasonable expectation to be included. The wife's reaction being \"shocked and upset\" suggests that the author didn't adequately explain his design choice before getting the tattoo. Now, changing the design after the wife is upset might not be feasible, but the author is reconsidering getting the tattoo at all, which shows he's aware of the problem.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, if he didn't communicate his intent clearly and the wife felt excluded despite being part of the family, then maybe he is at fault for not considering her feelings. On the other hand, if he was clear about lineage vs. family tree, then the wife and mother might be misunderstanding. But the author's explanation says he mentioned lineage, yet the wife still expected inclusion. That suggests the communication wasn't effective. The author's decision might be his right, but the way he handled it without considering the wife's perspective could be the issue. So, leaning towards AITA being on the author's side for not being considerate of his wife's feelings in the design.\n"
