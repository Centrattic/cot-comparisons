To make the situation worse, my mother (who has no tattoos) sided with my wife under the idea that our daughter was a product of both my wife and I.    I don\u2019t know if they are confusing the idea with family tree despite me saying I was using it to show my lineage or direct descendants.\n\nAITA for not wanting my wife\u2019s dob on my body / changing the design of the tattoo.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for not wanting to tattoo their wife's date of birth along with their own family's dates. The tattoo was meant to show their lineage: parents, them, and their daughter in Roman numerals. The wife thought her DOB would be included, but the author didn't include it. The mother-in-law sided with the wife, arguing that the daughter is a product of both parents, so maybe the wife's info should be there.\n\nFirst, the author's intention was to show their own lineage, not a family tree. They specified their parents, themselves, and their daughter. The wife misunderstood, expecting her DOB to be part of it. The author might not have communicated clearly enough that the tattoo was about their direct line, not including spouses. The mother-in-law's input complicates things, but maybe the main issue is the communication gap between the author and his wife. Did the author clearly explain the design's purpose? If he didn't, that's his fault. But if he did, then maybe not. However, since the wife was shocked, it seems communication was lacking. Also, the wife's perspective is valid because she's a parent to the daughter; maybe she felt her contribution wasn't acknowledged. So, the author might be at fault for not considering her feelings and not clarifying the design's intent properly. Therefore, answer A.\n"
