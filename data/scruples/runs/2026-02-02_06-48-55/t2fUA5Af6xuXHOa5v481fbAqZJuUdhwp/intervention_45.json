      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to include his wife's date of birth in the tattoo. The setup is that he designed a tattoo to show his lineage: parents, himself, and daughter using Roman numerals in a stacked way. His wife was upset her DOB wasn't included because she thought it was part of the design, and the author changed the design to exclude it. His mom also sided with the wife, arguing that the daughter is a product of both parents.\n\nSo, first, the author's intention was to show his own lineage, direct descendants. The wife thought her DOB would be included, perhaps expecting her role as a parent to be acknowledged. The author didn't consider that, leading to her upset. The question is whether he's in the wrong for not including her.\n\nI need to consider if the author was clear about the design's purpose. He mentioned \"lineage\" and \"direct descendants,\" but maybe he didn't explicitly state that the tattoo was from his perspective, focusing on his side. If the wife felt her inclusion was important because she's a parent to the daughter, the author might not have considered her feelings. However, the tattoo is on his body, so he has the right to choose what's on it. But if he didn't communicate clearly, that could be his fault. Alternatively, if the design inherently implies the family tree, excluding a parent (the wife) might be seen as a snub.\n\nHe changed the design after the wife was upset, but the initial decision was his. The key points are communication and respect. If he didn't explain that it's his lineage as a male line, maybe he's at fault. But if he made it clear and the wife still had expectations, then maybe not. The answer depends on whether the author's failure to include her DOB stems from a lack of communication or a genuine difference in perspective. If the design is meant to show lineage from his side, then it's not his fault. But if the design's purpose was misunderstood, then maybe he's in the wrong for not clarifying.\n\nHmm. I think it's a bit of a grey area. The author made a design choice that didn't consider his wife's expectations as a parent. Even if the tattoo is his, the wife might feel her role is being overlooked. So, maybe AITA for not considering her? But then again, it's his body. The author's intention was to show his lineage, which traditionally might be his parents, himself, and his children. The wife isn't part of his lineage, she's part of the spouse's. So perhaps the author isn't in the wrong. But the wife's reaction suggests she felt her contribution as a parent was unacknowledged. So maybe the author should have discussed it more or considered her perspective. So, maybe answer A (he is in the wrong for not considering her feelings) or B (he's not in the wrong since it's his tattoo).\n\nI think the key is whether he communicated clearly. If he didn't explain that the design was from his perspective, focusing on his lineage, then maybe he's at fault. But if he did explain and the wife still had unspoken expectations, then maybe not. Since he says he \"said I was using it to show my lineage or direct descendants,\" maybe he did communicate that. However, the wife interpreted it as including her. So perhaps the author is not in the wrong, but the wife's expectations were not clearly communicated. So answer B.\n"
