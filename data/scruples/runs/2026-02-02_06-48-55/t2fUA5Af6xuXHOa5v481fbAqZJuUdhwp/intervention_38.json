My Parents &gt; Me&gt; My Daughter in Roman numerals stacked oldest to youngest, bottom to top.  \n\nFor some reason my wife thought that her DOB would be included in this tattoo and was shocked and upset her DOB was not included.  To make the situation worse, my mother (who has no tattoos) sided with my wife under the idea that our daughter was a product of both my wife and I.    I don\u2019t know if they are confusing the idea with family tree despite me saying I was using it to show my lineage or direct descendants.\n\nAITA for not wanting my wife\u2019s dob on my body / changing the design of the tattoo.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to include his wife's date of birth in a tattoo that shows his lineage.\n\nFirst, the tattoo design is meant to represent his lineage: parents, himself, and daughter in Roman numerals. His wife expected her DOB to be part of it, leading to her being upset. His mom also took her side, arguing the daughter is a product of both parents. The author is now doubting the tattoo.\n\nHmm. The key points here are communication and assumptions. The author intended the tattoo to show his direct lineage, but the wife assumed her DOB would be included. Maybe the author didn't clearly explain the design's purpose. If he didn't communicate that it's only about his lineage (not the family tree), then perhaps the misunderstanding is on him. Including the wife's DOB might have been a way to honor her, and excluding it could feel dismissive. Also, the mother's support of the wife suggests the idea of mutual contribution is important here. The author's hesitation now might indicate he realizes that excluding her could be hurtful. So, even if the design is his choice, not considering the wife's feelings could make him at fault. Answer A.\n"
