      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not wanting their wife's DOB tattooed on them. The tattoo is supposed to represent their lineage: parents, themselves, and their daughter in Roman numerals. The wife expected her DOB to be included, but it wasn't. The mother also supported the wife's side, thinking the daughter is a product of both spouses.\n\nFirst, the author's intention was to show their direct lineage, which they specified as parents, self, and daughter. They didn't mention the wife. The wife might have assumed inclusion because she's part of the family, but the author made it clear it was about lineage, not the entire family tree. However, maybe the author didn't communicate clearly enough. The wife could feel her role is important in the family's lineage since the daughter is their child together. The author's mother also took the wife's side, implying the wife's inclusion is necessary.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the author didn't explain the distinction between lineage (direct descendants) and family tree (all immediate family), the wife's confusion is understandable. The author might have been too literal, not considering the emotional aspect. The wife's DOB is significant as it's part of the parent's identity in the child's lineage. The author's approach might be seen as excluding the wife's contribution, even if it's not part of the author's direct lineage. Therefore, the author could be at fault for not considering the wife's perspective and not clarifying the design's meaning thoroughly.\n"
