      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person (the author of the AITA post) is in the wrong for not wanting to include his wife's date of birth in his tattoo that shows his lineage. The tattoo is supposed to represent his lineage with Roman numerals stacked from oldest to youngest: parents, then himself, then his daughter. The wife expected her DOB to be there, and both the wife and the author's mother are upset because they think the daughter is a product of both parents. The author is now doubting if he did the right thing by excluding his wife.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's design is about his lineage, which he defines as parents, himself, and his daughter. The wife thought her DOB would be included, which suggests there was a miscommunication. The author should have discussed the tattoo design with his wife in detail to make sure both parties were on the same page. Since tattoos are permanent and personal, especially when involving family, it's important to include the spouse in the decision-making process. Even if the author's intention was to show his own lineage, the wife's contribution to the family (as the mother of their children) might be seen as significant. The mother's side is important, so excluding the wife's DOB could be viewed as overlooking her role. However, if the author clearly explained the purpose as his lineage and didn't mention including the wife, maybe he's not entirely wrong. But since the wife had an expectation and felt excluded, the author might be at fault for not discussing it thoroughly. The key points are communication and mutual agreement in a shared family decision. The answer hinges on whether the author's communication was sufficient and if excluding the wife's DOB was a fair omission given their relationship and family dynamics. It's possible that the author is in the wrong for not considering his wife's feelings and not ensuring mutual understanding before proceeding with the tattoo.\n"
