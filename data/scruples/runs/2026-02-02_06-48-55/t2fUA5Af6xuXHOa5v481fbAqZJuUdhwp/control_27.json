      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting to include his wife's date of birth on a tattoo that shows his lineage. The tattoo includes his parents, himself, and daughter using Roman numerals. The wife thought her DOB would be included and was upset. The mother also sided with the wife, thinking the daughter is a product of both parents.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are communication, expectations, and intentions. The author intended the tattoo to represent his direct lineage from his parents through him to his daughter. He didn't plan to include his wife's DOB, but the wife expected it. The author didn't clarify this expectation, leading to the conflict.\n\nCommunication seems to be a big factor here. If the author didn't make his intentions clear from the start, that's on him. The wife had a different expectation, possibly because she felt her role as a parent should be acknowledged. The author's design focuses on his lineage, which might overlook the collaborative nature of having a child. The mother's input adds to the pressure, but the main issue is between the couple.\n\nThe author is considering changing the design, which shows he's trying to find a middle ground. However, the initial problem is whether his original plan was wrong. Since the daughter is a product of both parents, excluding the wife's DOB might be seen as disregarding her contribution. The author's perspective is about his lineage, but the wife might see it as a family representation. The answer might hinge on how the design was communicated and the wife's feelings of being excluded despite her role in creating the family.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he didn't discuss the exclusion of his wife's DOB and it caused her distress, he might have failed to consider her feelings. On the other hand, if the tattoo was explicitly about his direct lineage, maybe it's not his fault. But given that the wife expected inclusion, and the mother supported her, there's a case that the author didn't adequately address her perspective. Therefore, he might be at fault for not communicating his intent clearly and not considering her feelings beforehand.\n"
