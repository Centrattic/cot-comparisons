My Parents &gt; Me&gt; My Daughter in Roman numerals stacked oldest to youngest, bottom to top.  \n\nFor some reason my wife thought that her DOB would be included in this tattoo and was shocked and upset her DOB was not included.  To make the situation worse, my mother (who has no tattoos) sided with my wife under the idea that our daughter was a product of both my wife and I.    I don\u2019t know if they are confusing the idea with family tree despite me saying I was using it to show my lineage or direct descendants.\n\nAITA for not wanting my wife\u2019s dob on my body / changing the design of the tattoo. Cuse I\u2019m having serious second thoughts about getting it done.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to include his wife's date of birth in a tattoo that includes his parents, himself, and daughter. The tattoo is meant to show his lineage, so maybe he's focusing on direct descendants from his side.\n\nThe wife was upset because she thought her DOB would be included. The author might not have communicated clearly. Maybe he didn't consider how important it was for her to be part of his personal lineage representation. Even though the daughter is a product of both parents, the author only included his side. His mother siding with the wife suggests that the wife's contribution is seen as significant. The author changed the design, which might have invalidated the wife's feelings. So, maybe the author didn't consider her perspective and the symbolism of the tattoo. Therefore, he might be in the wrong. But if the tattoo was specifically about his lineage from his family tree, maybe it's not his fault. However, relationships require consideration, so maybe he should have included her. I think the answer is A.\n"
