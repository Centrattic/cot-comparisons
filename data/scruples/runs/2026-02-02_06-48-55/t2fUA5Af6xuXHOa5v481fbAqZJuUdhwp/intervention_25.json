      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not wanting their wife's DOB on a tattoo that includes their parents, himself, and daughter. The tattoo is meant to show his lineage, going from parents to himself to the daughter, using Roman numerals stacked oldest to youngest. The wife expected her DOB to be there too, which upset her, and the mom agreed with her.\n\nFirst, the main issue is communication. The author explained the tattoo's purpose as his lineage, but the wife still expected her DOB included. Maybe the explanation wasn't clear enough. The wife might feel excluded if her birthdate isn't part of the tattoo, especially since she's the mother of the daughter. The mother-in-law's side about the daughter being a product of both parents adds another layer. It's possible the design doesn't reflect the collaborative nature of parenthood, which could be why they're upset.\n\nBut then, the tattoo is on the author's body. He has the right to choose what's on his own body. However, it's a shared family matter, so not considering his wife's feelings might be the problem. The key points here are consent and mutual understanding. Even if the initial idea was clear, maybe the author didn't check in with his wife enough. The wife's surprise and the mom's support suggest that the expectation wasn't communicated properly. The author might be in the wrong for not making sure everyone was on the same page, especially since it's a permanent decision. But if he clearly stated the purpose and the wife still had unspoken expectations, that's a different angle. It's a bit of a gray area, but leaning towards the author being in the wrong for not ensuring his wife felt included, given the circumstances.\n"
