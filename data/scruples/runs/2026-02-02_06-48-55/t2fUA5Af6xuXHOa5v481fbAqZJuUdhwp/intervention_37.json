To make the situation worse, my mother (who has no tattoos) sided with my wife under the idea that our daughter was a product of both my wife and I.    I don\u2019t know if they are confusing the idea with family tree despite me saying I was using it to show my lineage or direct descendants.\n\nAITA for not wanting my wife\u2019s dob on my body / changing the design of the tattoo.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (author) is at fault for not wanting to include his wife's date of birth in a tattoo that shows his lineage. The tattoo includes his parents, himself, and daughter, all in Roman numerals stacked from oldest to youngest. The wife was upset because she thought her DOB would be there, and the mother-in-law agreed with her, arguing that the daughter is a result of both parents.\n\nFirst, the main issue is about expectations. The author clearly stated the design was to show his lineage, which he defined as his parents, himself, and daughter. However, the wife and mother-in-law interpreted it as a family tree including both parents. The author didn't consider that his wife might expect her DOB to be part of the lineage or family tree concept. \n\nCommunication is key here. Even if the author's intention is to show his direct lineage, he should have discussed the design with his wife to ensure she understood and agreed. Since the wife was shocked and upset, it suggests a miscommunication. The author might have assumed his definition of lineage, but the wife had a different expectation. Also, the mother-in-law's input adds pressure, which could lead to family tension.\n\nThe author's second thoughts about the tattoo indicate he's reconsidering because of the conflict. This shows he values his wife's feelings, which is a positive sign. However, the issue is whether excluding her DOB is justified. Since the design is on his body, it's his choice, but not communicating properly might be where he's at fault. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but from a fairness perspective, it's about perspective. If the author made clear the design's purpose, maybe he's not wrong. But if he didn't discuss it thoroughly and caused hurt, then he's partially at fault. The answer hinges on whether the author adequately explained the design intent to his wife before proceeding.\n"
