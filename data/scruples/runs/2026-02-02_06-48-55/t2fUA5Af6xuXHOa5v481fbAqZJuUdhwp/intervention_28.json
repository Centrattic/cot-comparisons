      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting their wife's date of birth (DOB) on a tattoo that includes their parents, their own DOB, and their daughter's in Roman numerals.\n\nFirst, the tattoo is intended to represent lineage, from parents to the person, then to their daughter. The key point here is that the wife expected her DOB to be included, but the author didn't mention it. The wife was upset because she felt her DOB should be part of the lineage, especially since their daughter is a product of both spouses. The mother also supported the wife's viewpoint, probably thinking the author should include the wife's DOB as part of the family tree.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the tattoo is about his direct lineage\u2014parents, himself, and daughter. But the wife feels her role as a parent is being overlooked. The author didn't consult the wife properly, maybe, or didn't consider her feelings. The wife's DOB isn't part of his direct lineage in the same way as his own parents and children. However, the daughter's existence is a result of both parents, so excluding the wife's DOB might make her feel unacknowledged in the family structure.\n\nIs the author wrong for not including her? It depends on communication. If the author didn't discuss the design thoroughly with the wife and she felt it was implied her DOB would be included, then the author's oversight could be the issue. The wife's reaction suggests she felt her input was ignored, leading to hurt feelings. The mother's side-taking adds pressure on the author to include the wife's DOB, which complicates things further.\n\nThe author is having second thoughts about the tattoo now. Maybe the design doesn't reflect the family's dynamics accurately, especially since the daughter is a joint result. The author might need to rethink the tattoo to include the wife's DOB to honor her contribution. But if the original intention was strictly lineage from his side, maybe he's not wrong. However, the lack of communication and the wife's emotional reaction point more towards the author being at fault for not considering her feelings and input.\n"
