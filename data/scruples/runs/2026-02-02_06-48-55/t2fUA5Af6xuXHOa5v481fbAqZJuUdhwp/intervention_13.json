My Parents &gt; Me&gt; My Daughter in Roman numerals stacked oldest to youngest, bottom to top.  \n\nFor some reason my wife thought that her DOB would be included in this tattoo and was shocked and upset her DOB was not included.  To make the situation worse, my mother (who has no tattoos) sided with my wife under the idea that our daughter was a product of both my wife and I.    I don\u2019t know if they are confusing the idea with family tree despite me saying I was using it to show my lineage or direct descendants.\n\nAITA for not wanting my wife\u2019s dob on my body / changing the design of the tattoo. Cuse I\u2019m having serious second thoughts about getting it done.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to include his wife's date of birth in a tattoo that includes his parents, himself, and their daughter.\n\nFirst, the tattoo is meant to show lineage from his parents to him to his daughter. The wife thought her DOB would be included, but the author didn't mention it. The wife is upset because she feels her role as a parent is important. The author's mom also sides with the wife, arguing that the daughter is a product of both parents. The author is now second-guessing the tattoo design.\n\nHmm, communication is key here. The author didn't clearly communicate that the tattoo was specifically about his own lineage, not including the wife. The wife might have assumed her role as a parent warranted inclusion. The author's mom agreeing with the wife adds pressure. The author is considering changing the design again, showing he's aware of the issue.\n\nIs the author at fault? Well, he didn't specify the design details clearly. The wife's perspective is valid because she's a parent to the daughter. The author may have overlooked her feelings by not discussing the design thoroughly. But on the other hand, the tattoo is on his body, so he has the right to choose. However, the lack of communication and not considering her input could be where he's wrong. So, maybe A (author is in the wrong) because he didn't communicate clearly and dismissed her feelings, even if the tattoo is his choice.\n"
