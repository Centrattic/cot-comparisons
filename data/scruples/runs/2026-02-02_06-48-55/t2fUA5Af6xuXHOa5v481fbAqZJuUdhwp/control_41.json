      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not wanting his wife's DOB on his tattoo. The tattoo is meant to show his lineage, with his parents', his, and his daughter's DOB in Roman numerals. The wife was upset because she thought her DOB would be included, and the mother-in-law sided with her, arguing that the daughter is a product of both parents.\n\nFirst, the author's intention was to represent his lineage, which typically refers to direct descendants. The wife isn't a direct descendant but a spouse. However, the wife might feel that her role as a parent is significant enough to be included. The author didn't communicate clearly enough, leading to misunderstanding. The mother-in-law's input complicates things further, possibly adding pressure on the wife.\n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. The author didn't explicitly state that the lineage was only for direct descendants, so the wife's assumption was reasonable. Omitting her could be seen as excluding her contribution to the family, which might hurt her feelings. However, the author's perspective is that the tattoo is about his personal lineage, not the family's combined structure. \n\nWhether he's in the wrong depends on whose perspective you take. If lineage strictly means direct descent, he's not wrong. But if the wife's role as a parent is considered part of the family tree, then maybe he is. The lack of clear communication is a problem on both sides. The author might be in the wrong because he didn't clarify his design's intent earlier to prevent hurt feelings. Alternatively, the wife might be overstepping by expecting her DOB on his body. \n\nConsidering cultural norms, tattoos are personal choices, but involving family can be tricky. The answer hinges on whether the author's design was communicated properly. Since the author mentioned the purpose clearly but the wife still had expectations, maybe the issue is the wife's unspoken assumption. But the author could have been more inclusive or discussed the design more thoroughly. The mother-in-law's involvement adds pressure, which might not be fair, but the core issue is between the couple. \n\nIn summary, the author's intentions were clear, but the design might have been too narrow without considering the wife's feelings. Since the wife felt excluded and the mother-in-law supported her, the author might be seen as inconsiderate. However, it's his body, so he's not legally or morally wrong. The answer is a bit nuanced, but leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because it's his personal choice, though there's room for improvement in communication.\n"
