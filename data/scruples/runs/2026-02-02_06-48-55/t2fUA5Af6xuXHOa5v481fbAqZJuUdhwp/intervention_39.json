      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong regarding a tattoo that doesn't include their wife's birthdate.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author wanted a tattoo showing their lineage with Roman numerals for their parents, themselves, and their daughter. The wife expected her birthdate to be included too and was upset when it wasn't. The author's mom also took the wife's side, arguing that the daughter is a product of both parents. The author is now doubting if they're wrong for not including the wife.\n\nHmm. The key points here are communication and expectations. The author mentioned that they explained the tattoo was about their lineage, not a family tree. But the wife still thought it would include her. Maybe the author didn't communicate clearly enough. Even if the idea was to show direct descendants, the wife might feel left out, especially since they're part of the family. The author's mom agreeing with the wife suggests that the concept might be confusing from others' perspectives.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, it's their body, so they have the right to choose the tattoo design. However, the wife's feelings are valid because she might have expected to be included, especially since the daughter's birth is part of their shared life. The author's explanation about lineage being direct descendants might not have resonated with the wife. Maybe the author didn't consider the emotional aspect enough. So, while it's their decision, failing to see the wife's perspective could make them at fault for not being considerate. I think the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
