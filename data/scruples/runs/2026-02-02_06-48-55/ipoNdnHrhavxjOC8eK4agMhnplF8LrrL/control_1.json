We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for secretly using his wife's inheritance. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the couple has been married for 20 years. The wife received a large inheritance from her mother, and the husband was given legal authority to handle her mother's affairs while she was grieving. He used 40% of the inheritance to buy a new property in Colorado and the rest into their joint portfolio. The key points here are the legal authority, the wife's emotional state at the time, and the husband's intentions.\n\nThe husband claims he acted because the wife didn't want to deal with financial matters while grieving. He had prior interest in the Colorado market and saw an opportunity. His plan is to present the purchase to her later, hoping she'll like it. If not, he can rent or sell it.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. Legally, if he had authority, maybe he's in the right. But ethically, using someone's inheritance without their knowledge, even with authority, might be questionable. The wife might have different financial goals. Even if he had her permission to handle the affairs, using the funds without her explicit consent for a major purchase seems like a breach of trust. Inheritances are often personal, and using them without discussion could be seen as overstepping, regardless of the timing. The husband's plan to reveal it later might not mitigate the fact that he made a significant decision without her input. Trust and transparency are crucial in a marriage, so this action could be seen as selfish despite his intentions. Therefore, the answer is likely A.\n"
