We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for secretly using his wife's inheritance to buy a new property. \n\nFirst, the key facts: The wife's inheritance was from her mother, and she gave the husband legal authority to handle the will during her grieving period. He used 40% of that inheritance to buy a house in Colorado without her knowledge. He plans to see how she feels about it and either move there, rent it out, or sell it.\n\nSo, the main issue here is the unauthorized use of the wife's money. Even though she gave him legal authority to handle the will, that doesn't necessarily mean she gave consent to spend 40% of the inheritance without her knowledge. Legal authority to sort through affairs might not equate to a green light for making a significant financial decision like purchasing property. \n\nTrust is a big factor in a marriage. The husband didn't consult her about this major purchase, which could be seen as a breach of trust. Even if he thought he was acting in their best interest, the lack of communication is a problem. Additionally, the wife was grieving, which might make her more vulnerable, and using that time to make such a decision without her input could be seen as taking advantage of her emotional state.\n\nThe husband's reasoning is that he wanted to capitalize on a good investment opportunity and that he planned to involve her later. However, the act of making a large financial commitment without her knowledge and input is risky. If the wife is unhappy with the purchase, it could lead to significant marital conflict. The husband's plan to \"visit once a month\" to gauge her reaction is not a substitute for full disclosure and mutual decision-making.\n\nIn terms of financial ethics within a marriage, both partners generally have a right to be involved in major financial decisions, especially when dealing with assets that are not jointly owned. The inheritance is the wife's, so her consent should be required for such a large expenditure, regardless of the circumstances. The husband's actions, while possibly well-intentioned, lack transparency and respect for her autonomy in financial matters.\n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because he made a significant financial decision without his wife's knowledge and consent, even if she had given him authority to handle the will. The key issue is the unauthorized use of her inheritance, which undermines trust and financial partnership in the marriage.\n"
