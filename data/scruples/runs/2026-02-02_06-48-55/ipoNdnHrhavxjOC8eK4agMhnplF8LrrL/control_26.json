We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for secretly spending his wife's inheritance. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The husband and wife have been married for 20 years, living in a condo. The wife received a large inheritance from her mother, which the husband was given legal authority to handle because she was grieving. He used 40% of it to buy a new property in Colorado without her knowledge, putting the rest into their joint portfolio. His reasoning was that she didn't want to deal with financial matters during her grief, and he saw a good investment opportunity. Now he's considering telling her and is worried about being selfish.\n\nSo, the key points here are: legal authority given, but was it used appropriately? The husband had the legal power to manage her affairs, but does that mean he can spend the inheritance however he wants? Also, the inheritance is part of the wife's personal assets, even if they are in a joint portfolio now. \n\nMarital assets can be a gray area, but inheritances are typically considered separate property unless they are specifically transferred into joint ownership. If the husband used part of her inheritance without her consent, even with legal authority, that might be a problem. Legal authority to handle the affairs doesn't necessarily mean he can make such a significant financial decision without her input. The trust aspect is also important here. The wife might feel betrayed if he made a major purchase without discussing it with her, especially since they've been married for so long.\n\nAdditionally, the husband's plan to see how she feels about the new property shows he's aware that she might not approve. That suggests he knew there was a risk of her disapproval but went ahead anyway. The fact that he's considering resale or rental if she doesn't like it implies he's not fully committed to her wishes, which could be seen as self-serving.\n\nOn the other hand, he did have legal authority, which complicates things. But legal authority doesn't always equate to moral or ethical permission. The husband might have thought he was acting in their best interest, but using someone else's inheritance without their knowledge is a big decision. Even if the wife gave him the authority, she might not have intended for him to spend a significant portion on a new property. The grief angle is a factor, but that doesn't absolve him from transparency.\n\nIn summary, while the husband had the legal power to manage his wife's affairs during her time of grief, using a large portion of her inheritance without her consent and for a personal investment (even if he thinks it's for both of them) crosses ethical lines. The trust and financial autonomy in a marriage matter, and major decisions like this should involve both parties. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
