We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the person wrote a Reddit post asking if they're the asshole for secretly spending their wife's inheritance. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, they got a large inheritance from the wife's mother. The wife was grieving and gave him legal authority to handle the will. He used 40% of that inheritance to buy a new property in Colorado and put the rest into their joint portfolio. He did this without telling her because she didn't want to deal with financial matters while grieving. Now he's wondering if he's in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Let's consider the key points. The wife gave him legal authority, but did she explicitly give permission to spend the inheritance? He says she told him to take care of the implications of the will. But using a significant portion to buy a house might not be what she intended. Inheritances are often considered the recipient's separate property unless they commingle them. If the inheritance was meant to be her separate money, using it without her consent could be an issue, even if she gave him authority over the will's administration. \n\nLegal authority to handle the will might not mean he has the right to use her money for personal investment opportunities. The purpose of legal authority in handling a will is usually to distribute assets according to the will's terms or the law, not to make major purchases unless specified. So if the will didn't instruct that the inheritance be used for buying a house, he might have overstepped. \n\nAlso, even if they are married, each spouse typically has the right to control their own inherited property unless they have a specific agreement. Spouses don't automatically share all assets equally unless it's a community property state. But even in community property states, an inheritance is usually considered separate unless they agree otherwise. So using her inheritance without her consent could be a violation of her ownership. \n\nThe man's reasoning is that he did it without her knowing because she didn't want to deal with financial stuff while grieving. But that's not a valid excuse. He should have discussed the use of her money with her once she was ready, even if it was after the grieving period. The fact that he kept it a secret and made a major financial decision without her input is problematic. \n\nHe also plans to surprise her with the purchase and then decide based on her reaction whether to keep it or sell. That's risky because he's not considering her ownership rights. If she's unhappy, she might have legal recourse to reclaim her inheritance. His plan to use it as a rental or sell it shows he's aware it's not certain, but he's still taking her money without her approval. \n\nIn conclusion, even if he had legal authority to handle the will, spending her inheritance without her consent is likely wrong. Marital trust and transparency are important, and using her money without discussing it breaches that trust. So the answer is A.\n"
