We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for using their wife's inheritance without her knowledge. \n\nFirst, the wife gave the author legal authority to handle her mother's affairs while she was grieving. The author used 40% of the inheritance to buy a new property and put the rest in their joint portfolio. \n\nHmm, legal authority is a key point here. If he was given power of attorney or something similar, he might have the right to manage the funds. But wait, the question is about using the inheritance, not just managing it. Using a portion for a personal investment might not be within the scope of what she intended when giving authority. \n\nAlso, the author mentions they have different financial mindsets. The wife is conservative, and he's more aggressive. Even with authority, using a significant portion of her inheritance without her input could be an issue. She might not have wanted to invest in real estate, especially in another state, without discussing it. \n\nThe author's plan to surprise her with the purchase might backfire. While he thinks it's a good investment, it's a big decision that affects their finances. The fact that he's worried about her reaction and considering telling her suggests he's aware it's a gray area. \n\nInheritance is a personal asset, even if it's in a joint account. Depending on their jurisdiction, using it without consent could be problematic. Plus, the sentimental value of their current home vs. a new Colorado property might not align with her wishes. \n\nSo, even if he had the authority, using her money for his investment without her knowledge crosses a line. The key points are consent, transparency, and mutual decision-making in a marriage. The author acted unilaterally, which is likely the mistake here.\n"
