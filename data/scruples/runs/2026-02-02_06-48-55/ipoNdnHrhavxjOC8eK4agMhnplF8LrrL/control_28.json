We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the husband did the right thing here. So, he used his wife's inheritance to buy a new property without her knowing. The key points here are about consent and how the inheritance is handled.\n\nFirst, the wife gave him legal authority to handle her mother's affairs while she was grieving. That's important because it's a form of permission, but does that permission extend to spending the inheritance on a new property? He used 40% of it for the Colorado house. The inheritance is technically her money, right? Even if he had the legal power to manage the affairs, using her inheritance without her consent might be crossing a line. \n\nHe says he wanted to buy a house and saw an opportunity. But the money isn't his. Even if he's managing it, the decision to spend such a large portion on a personal investment without discussing it with her first seems like a problem. The wife might have different financial priorities, especially since she's more conservative. He's making a major financial decision that affects both of them without her input. \n\nAlso, he mentions that if she doesn't like it, he can sell it. But that's after the fact. The surprise could lead to resentment. Even if the plan is good, the lack of transparency is a big issue. In marriages, major financial decisions usually require both partners' agreement. The husband taking this action without her knowledge, even with legal authority, might not be ethical. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the legal authority might cover handling the affairs but not necessarily spending the inheritance on a personal investment. The wife might feel her money was misused. The answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
