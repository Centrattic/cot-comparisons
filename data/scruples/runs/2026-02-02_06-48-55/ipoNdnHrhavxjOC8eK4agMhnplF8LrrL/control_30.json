We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the husband who secretly spent his wife's inheritance is in the wrong. The scenario involves him using 40% of her inheritance to buy a property in Colorado without her knowledge, using her authority she gave him to handle her mother's affairs.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The wife gave him legal authority to sort through her mother's affairs. However, using a portion of the inheritance for a personal investment might be questionable. Inheritances are typically considered the sole property of the recipient unless specified otherwise in a will. Since the husband used her inheritance without her consent, even if she gave him authority, that might not cover personal financial decisions. Legally, he might have overstepped his authority here.\n\nNext, the ethical angle. Trust is crucial in a marriage. By making a major financial decision without informing his wife, especially one of this magnitude, he's acting unilaterally. Even though he had her permission to handle the will, using the funds for a shared investment or property purchase isn't something he should decide alone. The wife might feel disrespected or betrayed, which could harm their relationship. The husband's reasoning about her grieving and not wanting to deal with financial issues is valid, but it's not a substitute for transparency. He should have discussed the matter with her once she was ready, even if it was inconvenient.\n\nThe husband's plan to check in with her monthly shows he's considering her feelings, but it's reactive. The proactive approach would have been to communicate his intentions earlier. The surprise element could backfire, especially if the wife is unhappy with the decision. The fact that he's now seeking feedback on Reddit indicates he's aware this might be a problem, which suggests guilt or uncertainty about his actions.\n\nAdditionally, the husband mentions the property as a potential rental or resale, which introduces financial risks. If the market doesn't work out, the wife could be left with a loss from her inheritance. Even if the investment is sound, the lack of consent is an issue. Financial decisions of this scale require mutual agreement, especially when one person's inheritance is involved.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, inheritances received by one spouse are considered separate property. Using that without consent could lead to legal disputes, particularly if the marriage is in a community property state. Even in non-community property states, using someone else's separate funds without consent is problematic.\n\nThe husband's justification that he \"had to buy it without her knowledge\" because of her grieving might not hold up under scrutiny. While respecting her emotional state is important, it doesn't negate the need for transparency. The husband could have waited until she was ready to discuss the inheritance's use, even if it meant delaying the purchase. The opportunity cost of waiting might have been high, but the trust cost of acting unilaterally is even higher.\n\nIn conclusion, while the husband might have had good intentions and a valid reason for not discussing it immediately, the act of using her inheritance without her consent, despite having authority for other matters, is ethically and likely legally problematic. The key issue is the lack of consent for a personal financial decision that involves her separate funds. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
