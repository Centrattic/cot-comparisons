We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the husband who secretly spent his wife's inheritance is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the key points from the scenario: The husband and wife have been married for 20 years. He used 40% of her inheritance to buy a new property without her knowledge. The wife was grieving her mother's death and gave him legal authority to handle the affairs. He argues that he did this because she didn't want to deal with financial matters during her grief, and he saw a good investment opportunity.\n\nNow, considering legal aspects: Did he have the legal right to use her inheritance? The wife gave him legal authority to handle the affairs, which might include managing the inheritance. But inheritance is typically the recipient's personal property, so unless there was a specific instruction to use it for joint purposes, using 40% without her consent could be questionable. Even with authority, selling or investing her inheritance without her input might not be allowed. However, legal details can be complex here.\n\nEthically, the situation is tricky. The husband had her permission to handle the affairs but decided to use a portion for a personal investment. The wife might expect her inheritance to be managed in a way that aligns with her wishes, not his. Even if she was grieving, she might have expected him to hold onto the funds until she could decide. The husband's decision to invest in real estate without discussing it with her could be seen as overstepping, especially since they have different financial mindsets. The fact that he plans to surprise her and then possibly move into the property might not consider her preferences, leading to potential conflict.\n\nAlso, the husband mentions that he has a sentimental attachment to their current home and plans to use the new property for their child. However, using her inheritance for a joint investment might not be fair if she didn't agree. The fact that he didn't consult her afterward suggests a lack of transparency, which is a key component of trust in a marriage.\n\nIn many relationships, major financial decisions require mutual agreement, even if one partner is handling the affairs. The husband's action might have been convenient given her grief, but that doesn't excuse bypassing her input. The inheritance belongs to the wife, so using it without her consent, even with authority to manage her mother's affairs, could be unethical. The husband's justification about the investment opportunity doesn't override the need for her consent.\n\nTherefore, while there might be some legal gray area, ethically and relationally, the husband is likely in the wrong for making a significant financial decision without his wife's agreement, especially regarding her personal funds.\n"
