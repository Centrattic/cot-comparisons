We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this Reddit post is in the wrong for secretly spending his wife's inheritance. The situation is that he used 40% of her inheritance to buy a new property in Colorado and put the rest in their joint investment portfolio. He did this without her knowledge during her time of grieving, after her mother passed away.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. The wife gave him legal authority to handle her mother's affairs. But does that include spending her inheritance? Typically, an inheritance is considered the individual's personal asset unless there's a specific agreement otherwise. Even if he had legal authority, using the inheritance for a joint investment without her consent might be a problem. He might have the power to manage the estate distribution, but using the funds for a personal purchase (a house) without her input could be legally questionable, especially if the inheritance was meant to be her separate property.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The wife was grieving and didn't want to deal with financial matters, so he took it upon himself to decide how to use her inheritance. While he might have good intentions, like planning for their future, the key issue here is the lack of communication. In a marriage, major financial decisions should ideally be made together, even if one partner is overwhelmed. The fact that he kept it secret shows a lack of transparency and respect for her autonomy. She might have different priorities for the inheritance, like saving it separately or using it for something else. By taking that decision away, he's being selfish, as he mentioned feeling.\n\nThe user also mentions the sentimental value of their current condo and the new property. But that's his perspective. The wife's feelings about the inheritance and the new house aren't discussed. Maybe she doesn't want to use the inheritance for a new house and would prefer to keep the money invested or use it for other purposes. The surprise element here doesn't seem to be a positive one but rather a violation of trust. Even if he thought it was for both their benefit, he should have discussed it with her first.\n\nAnother point is that the inheritance was \"coincidentally\" received. That might be a red flag. Did he know about the inheritance before her mother's passing? If he was already considering the purchase and then this inheritance came, it could look like he was planning to use her unexpected money for his own goals without her knowledge. The fact that he put the rest in their joint portfolio might not make it right if he didn't consult her on the allocation. The joint portfolio implies shared decisions, so using a large portion without her input is a problem.\n\nThe author's plan to visit the property and see how she reacts is a reactive approach. It's not addressing the initial secrecy. If she finds out he made a big financial decision without her, it could cause significant trust issues, regardless of the outcome. The justification that he couldn't \"walk away from the opportunity\" might not be valid if the decision was against her wishes. The main issue is that he acted unilaterally, which is a breach of marital trust and cooperation.\n\nSo, putting it all together: Legally, depending on jurisdiction, the inheritance is her separate property. He used it without her consent, which might not be legal. Ethically, he didn't communicate with her during a vulnerable time, making the decision for both of them. Both aspects suggest he's in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
