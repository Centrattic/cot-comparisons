We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for secretly using their wife's inheritance. So, first, I need to break down the situation.\n\nThe author is married for 20 years, living in a condo with sentimental value. They want to buy a new house in Colorado, but the wife is more conservative and didn't want to deal with financial issues during her grief. The author had legal authority from the wife to handle her mother's affairs, which included the inheritance. He used 40% of that inheritance to buy the new property and put the rest into their joint portfolio. The key points here are the legal authority and the secrecy.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let me think about the legal aspect first. If the wife gave him legal authority, maybe through a power of attorney or a specific directive, to handle her mother's affairs, then technically he might have the legal right to manage that money. But did she authorize him to spend it for their mutual benefit, or just to sort through the affairs? The line here is important. Managing affairs might include distributing the inheritance, but using a portion of it without her consent could be an overstep, even if it's for the family.\n\nThen there's the ethical angle. The wife was grieving, which makes her more vulnerable. Even if she gave authority, using a significant portion of her inheritance without discussing it afterward seems like a breach of trust. The author mentions wanting to benefit both of their lives, but that's a common argument in these situations. The fact that he's keeping it a secret and planning to reveal it only when he feels it's appropriate shows a lack of transparency, which is a big issue in relationships. Trust is crucial, and withholding such a major financial decision could lead to serious problems.\n\nAlso, the inheritance is the wife's personal money, especially since it came from her mother. Even if it's in a joint portfolio, the source is her inheritance. The author might have thought he was acting in their best interest, but without mutual agreement, it's a risk. The wife might feel her financial autonomy was violated. Plus, the author's plan to use it as a rental or resell if she doesn't like it implies a potential conflict of interest if he's the one making those decisions unilaterally.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, even if the husband had legal authority to handle the inheritance, using it for joint purposes without the wife's explicit consent could be problematic. Inheritances are typically considered separate property unless the wife chooses to combine them. So by using her inheritance to buy a property in their name, he might have mixed her assets without her agreement. If they have a joint investment portfolio, maybe the rest is there, but the 40% used for the house purchase is a different matter. If the house is in their joint name, that's using her inheritance for a shared asset without her input.\n\nAnother point is the timing. The wife was grieving, and he took advantage of that to make a big financial decision. Even if she initially agreed to him handling the affairs, the use of her inheritance for a new home without her consent during a vulnerable time could be seen as manipulative. The husband's reasoning that he couldn't wait for the opportunity might not excuse the secrecy.\n\nSo, putting it all together: legally, there might be some gray area if the authority was granted, but ethically, the lack of transparency and the use of her inheritance without her input (even if she was grieving) is a major issue. The husband's actions could be seen as violating the trust and respect that are fundamental in a marriage. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
