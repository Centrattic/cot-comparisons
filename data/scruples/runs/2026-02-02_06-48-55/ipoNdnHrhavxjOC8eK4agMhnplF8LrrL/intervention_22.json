We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for secretly spending his wife's inheritance. \n\nFirst, the key points from the situation: The husband spent 40% of the inheritance to buy a new property in Colorado without his wife's knowledge. He had legal authority to handle her mother's affairs, but he used the inheritance for his own investment. The wife was grieving and didn't want to deal with financial matters, so she gave him authority. The husband's reasoning is that he saw a good opportunity and didn't want to miss it, planning to either move there or rent it out.\n\nNow, considering legal and ethical aspects. Legally, if the wife gave him authority, he might have the power of attorney or some legal permission. However, using someone else's inheritance without their consent, even if they're a spouse, is a big deal. Inheritance is typically considered separate property unless there's a joint account or something. So using it without asking could be problematic. \n\nEthically, even if he had authority, the inheritance belongs to the wife. Using it for a personal investment without her input shows a lack of trust and respect. The husband might have thought he was acting in their best interest, but withholding such a significant decision from the spouse is a breach of trust. \n\nThe husband's plan to \"visit it once a month and see how she feels\" seems dismissive of her potential feelings and ownership. The surprise element implies he didn't care to include her in the decision-making process. \n\nIn most relationships, major financial decisions should be discussed. Even if the wife was grieving, the husband should have waited until she was ready to make such a decision together. His actions might have been driven by his own desires under the guise of acting on her behalf, which could lead to resentment.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is likely A. The husband is in the wrong because he used his wife's money without her consent, even with legal authority, which doesn't negate the ethical breach in a marriage where joint decisions are expected.\n"
