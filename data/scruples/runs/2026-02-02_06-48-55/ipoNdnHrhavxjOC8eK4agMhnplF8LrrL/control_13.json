We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he used his wife's inheritance money without her knowledge to buy a new property and invest the rest. \n\nFirst, inheritance is typically considered separate property, right? If the wife received it as her own, especially as the only child, then it's hers. Even though he had legal authority to handle her mother's affairs, using 40% of her inheritance without her consent seems like a big deal. The legal authority might allow him to manage the affairs, like closing accounts or handling legal stuff, but spending such a large portion on a property that they might move into\u2014does that fall under the authority? Maybe not. The authority might be for administrative tasks, not financial decisions like investing.\n\nHe mentioned she was grieving, so he took advantage of that time to act. Even if he had her permission to handle the will, using her money without her input is a problem. Trust is important in a marriage. Even if he thought it was for both their benefits, making such a big financial decision without her, especially with her inheritance, which is a personal asset, is a breach of trust. \n\nAlso, the fact that he's planning to move there or rent it out shows he didn't consider her wishes. They were living in a place with sentimental value, and he's moving to another state without her knowledge. That's a major life decision. Even if he has a plan to check in with her, he already used her money without her consent. \n\nFinancial decisions should be mutual in a marriage. Using her inheritance without discussing it, even if he thought she wouldn't want to deal with it during grief, is wrong. He should have waited or discussed it once she was ready. So yeah, the author is in the wrong because he misused his wife's money without her consent, which is a serious issue.\n"
