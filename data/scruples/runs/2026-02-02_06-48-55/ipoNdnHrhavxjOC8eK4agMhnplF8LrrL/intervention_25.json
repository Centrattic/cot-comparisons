We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the situation is that the person used their wife's inheritance to buy a new property without her knowledge. They had legal authority to handle the affairs because the wife was grieving and gave them power of attorney. But the key point is whether they did the right thing by using 40% of the inheritance without her consent.\n\nFirst, legal authority is important. If the wife specifically gave them the legal right to handle her mother's affairs, maybe that's a factor. But inheritance is a personal asset, even if managed by someone else. Even with legal authority, using a significant portion for a personal investment, like buying a house in Colorado, might be crossing a line. The wife might not have intended for her inheritance to be used in that way, especially since they have a kid and the current condo is sentimental. \n\nThe husband's reasoning is that he wanted to take advantage of the Colorado market and didn't want to burden her during her grieving. However, using someone else's money without their explicit consent, even if they gave you power of attorney, could be problematic. The power of attorney usually allows for making decisions on their behalf but doesn't necessarily mean they can make major financial decisions that benefit themselves. The husband's plan to check in later is risky because the wife might be upset when she finds out, especially since the investment isn't guaranteed to be a success. \n\nAlso, the husband's financial freedom now that the kid is gone might be a personal justification, but the inheritance is separate from their joint finances. The wife's conservative mindset versus the husband's more aggressive approach isn't a valid reason to make a unilateral decision. Transparency in a marriage is crucial, especially regarding major financial decisions. Even if the husband thought it was for the best, the lack of communication and consent is a big issue. \n\nSo, even with legal authority, using the inheritance without discussing it with his wife is likely wrong. He should have gotten her consent after the initial authority was given for handling the will. The surprise move could lead to trust issues. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
