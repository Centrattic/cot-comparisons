We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's analyze this situation. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for secretly spending their wife's inheritance. \n\nFirst, the key points: The husband used 40% of the inheritance (which he was given legal authority to handle during her mother's will settlement) to buy a house in Colorado. The rest went into their joint portfolio. He didn't inform her about the purchase, waiting until after she was grieving. His reasoning is that he saw a good investment opportunity and didn't want to walk away from it. Now, he's considering telling her or keeping it a secret, planning to visit monthly to gauge her reaction.\n\nNow, considering legal aspects: He had legal authority to manage the inheritance, but that doesn't necessarily mean he can use it as he pleases. Inheritances can sometimes be considered separate property, especially if the will specified it. However, depending on the jurisdiction, marital status might affect this. However, the wife might expect that her inheritance is her separate property, not marital. If the husband used a portion of it without her knowledge, even with her initial permission to handle the will, there's a question of consent for the specific use of the funds.\n\nEthically, transparency is important in a marriage. Even if he had the legal authority, the lack of communication could be seen as a breach of trust. The husband's justification is that he didn't want to burden her during her grieving period, but that doesn't negate the need for honesty once she was ready. The surprise factor here might lead to significant conflict if she feels her inheritance was used without her input, especially since it's a large sum and a decision of this magnitude affects both their financial futures.\n\nAdditionally, the house is in Colorado, which might not be where they currently live, and using her inheritance for a property that could become a rental or resale might not align with her long-term goals. The husband's plan to see her reaction passively (visiting monthly) seems risky and could lead to resentment if she's unhappy.\n\nIn many relationships, major financial decisions require mutual agreement. Even if the husband believed he had the right to use the funds, the secrecy is a red flag. The wife might feel violated or disrespected, which can erode trust. The husband's actions could be seen as selfish because he made a unilateral decision that affects their shared life without her consent.\n\nLegally, if the inheritance was her separate property, using it without her consent could be an issue. Even if it's joint, the manner in which he used it without discussing it is problematic. Ethically, the lack of transparency is a significant factor here.\n\nSo, considering both legal and ethical angles, the husband is likely in the wrong. The answer is A.\n"
