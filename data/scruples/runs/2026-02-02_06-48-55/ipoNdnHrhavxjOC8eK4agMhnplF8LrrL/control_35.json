We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for secretly spending his wife's inheritance. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The wife received an inheritance from her mother, and the husband was given legal authority to handle her mother's affairs. With that authority, he used 40% of the inheritance to buy a new property in Colorado and put the rest into their joint portfolio. He did this without her knowledge because she was grieving and didn't want to deal with financial matters.\n\nNow, legal authority is important here. If he had legal power of attorney or some form of legal permission to manage her affairs, he might have the right to make decisions on her behalf. But even with legal authority, using a significant portion of her inheritance without her knowledge could be problematic. Inheritance is typically considered personal property, and while she gave him authority to sort out her mother's affairs, the inheritance is hers, not the estate's. So, he might have the legal right to manage the estate's affairs but not necessarily to spend her personal inheritance.\n\nAlso, the husband's reasoning is that he wanted to take advantage of a market opportunity and thought this would benefit both. However, using her money without her consent, even if with good intentions, is a breach of trust. The wife might feel betrayed, especially since the inheritance is her personal asset. The fact that he used 40% of it without discussing it with her is a big deal. Even if she was grieving, once she finds out, she might feel her autonomy was violated.\n\nAnother angle is the joint investment portfolio. By putting the remaining money there, he's mixing her inheritance with their joint funds, which could complicate things if she decides to dispute the use of her inheritance. Legally, this might be an issue if she contests the transaction later. Financial decisions of this magnitude usually require mutual agreement, especially when it's her personal money.\n\nSentimentally, the husband mentions the condo has sentimental value and they might use the new property for their son. But the main issue is the unauthorized use of her inheritance. Even if the outcome is beneficial, the method of doing it without her knowledge is ethically questionable. Trust is a cornerstone in a marriage, and this action could damage that trust irreparably.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, even with power of attorney, managing someone else's personal assets without their consent can be legally questionable, especially if it's in their inheritance. The husband might have had the authority to handle the estate's affairs, but the inheritance is separate. He should have waited until she was ready to discuss or made sure he had her explicit consent for such a significant expenditure.\n\nSo, putting it all together, while he might have had some legal authority to handle her mother's affairs, using her inheritance without her knowledge is a breach of trust and likely a misuse of her personal funds. Ethically and possibly legally, he's in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
