We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for secretly spending his wife's inheritance.\n\nFirst, the key points here: The husband used 40% of his wife's inheritance to buy a new property in Colorado without her knowing. He had legal authority to handle her mother's affairs, but he used the inheritance without consulting her. The wife was grieving, and he took advantage of that time to make a significant financial decision. \n\nInheritance is typically considered the individual's property, especially if it's left directly to her. Even though the husband had legal authority, using the inheritance without her consent for a personal investment (like a new home) might be problematic. Marital trust and transparency are important here. Even if he had good intentions, keeping such a large decision a secret could be seen as a breach of trust. \n\nAlso, the fact that he plans to use the property as a rental or sell it if she doesn't like the idea shows that he's considering potential backlash. He's aware that she might not approve, which adds to the ethical issue of making a unilateral decision. \n\nFinancial decisions involving someone else's inheritance, especially without their input, are generally considered wrong unless there's a prior agreement or legal obligation. The husband's justification about the opportunity and his own financial freedom doesn't outweigh the importance of mutual consent in a marriage. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the husband is likely in the wrong because he made a significant financial commitment with his wife's money without her knowledge or consent, even if he had legal authority to handle some aspects of her affairs. The lack of communication and respecting her autonomy in financial matters is a major issue here.\n"
