We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband secretly using his wife's inheritance to buy a new property without her knowledge. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. The wife gave him legal authority to handle her mother's affairs, which includes the inheritance. So, legally, he might have the power to manage that money. But using 40% to buy a house without consulting her is a big step. Even if he had the authority, using someone else's money (which is technically his wife's now) without her consent could be problematic, especially for such a significant purchase.\n\nThen there's the emotional side. The wife was grieving, and he took advantage of that by not discussing the major decision. Trust in a marriage is built on open communication. By keeping this a secret, he's undermining that trust. Even if his intentions are good, the method is questionable.\n\nFinancial decisions of this scale should be mutual. They've been married 20 years, so major life choices, like moving or investing a large sum, should be discussed together. The husband's reasoning that he didn't want to burden her during her grief might be understandable, but it's not a valid excuse for not seeking her input afterward. Presenting the decision as a surprise might lead to resentment if she doesn't agree with it.\n\nAlso, the husband's plan to visit the property monthly and see her reaction suggests he's aware there might be a problem. His hesitation and the \"sinking feeling\" indicate guilt or uncertainty, which points to potential wrongdoing. Even if the investment is sound, the lack of transparency is a red flag.\n\nIn relationships, financial transparency is crucial. The husband's action could be seen as a breach of trust, even if he had legal authority. The key issue here is the lack of communication and mutual agreement on a significant financial decision. Therefore, the husband is likely in the wrong.\n"
