We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for secretly using their wife's inheritance to buy a new property. \n\nFirst, the key points from the story: The husband used 40% of his wife's inheritance to buy a house in Colorado without her knowledge. The wife was grieving her mother's death and gave him legal authority to handle her mother's affairs. However, he didn't consult her about using the inheritance for this purchase.\n\nNow, inheritance is typically considered personal property, especially if it's from a family member. Even though he was given legal authority to handle the affairs, that doesn't necessarily mean he had the right to spend the inheritance without her consent. The wife might view the inheritance as her personal asset, not joint marital property. \n\nThe husband's reasoning is that he wanted to take advantage of the Colorado market and didn't want to burden her during her grief. But the fact remains that he made a significant financial decision without her input. Even if he intended to share the benefits later, the act of using her money without permission is a breach of trust. \n\nFinancial decisions of this magnitude usually require mutual agreement in a marriage. Secrets like this can lead to major trust issues. The husband's plan to \"surprise\" her with the new house if she likes it suggests he didn't value her input in the decision-making process. \n\nIn many legal systems, inherited money is the individual's property, not the couple's. So he might have had the legal right to use it, but ethically, it's questionable. The emotional aspect of trust and transparency in a marriage is crucial here. Even if he had good intentions, the method was wrong because he didn't communicate openly with his wife.\n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because he violated his wife's trust by using her inheritance without her knowledge, regardless of the reasoning. The answer is A.\n"
