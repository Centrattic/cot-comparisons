We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for secretly spending their wife's inheritance. The situation is that the husband used 40% of her inheritance to buy a new property in Colorado without her knowledge. The wife was grieving her mother's death and gave him legal authority to handle the affairs, but he used that to make a big financial decision without consulting her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The wife gave him legal authority, which might mean he had the power to act on her behalf. However, using a significant portion of her inheritance without her consent, even if she was grieving, is a big deal. Legal authority doesn't necessarily mean he can make all decisions; there might be bounds, especially when it's a major financial decision that affects her assets. Also, Colorado is a different state, so maybe there are state-specific laws about joint ownership or inheritance.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. Even if he had the legal authority, using her inheritance without discussing it with her once she's out of the grieving period could be considered a breach of trust. Marriages usually require transparency about major financial decisions. The husband's reasoning is that he wanted to take advantage of a market opportunity and plans to check in with her later. But that's not really being upfront; it's more like keeping a secret and waiting to see her reaction, which could lead to a bigger issue if she's upset.\n\nAlso, the husband mentions that the money is in their joint investment portfolio. If the inheritance was meant to be hers specifically, using part of it for a joint account might not be appropriate. Inheritances are typically considered separate property unless the wife had already commingled it with marital assets. If the husband used her separate property for a joint account, that could be problematic.\n\nAnother point is the husband's intention to use the property as a rental or sell it if she doesn't like the idea. This shows that he's considering his own financial gain, possibly at her expense. The wife might not have wanted to invest in Colorado, and her inheritance was her personal asset. Even if he had the authority to handle her affairs, that doesn't mean he can make unilateral decisions that could affect her financial security.\n\nThe husband's plan to \"visit it once a month and see how she feels\" is a bit passive. It's not addressing the issue head-on. If he's planning to surprise her, that's not honest communication. Trust in a marriage is built on transparency, so keeping this secret until he deems it appropriate to reveal could damage the relationship if she finds out she was kept in the dark about such a significant matter.\n\nLooking at legal precedents, in many jurisdictions, even if one spouse has authority over another's assets during a specific time, major decisions like purchasing real estate should be made with the asset owner's consent, especially if there's a potential for conflict of interest. The husband's use of her inheritance for his investment could be seen as a conflict because he stands to benefit from the property's appreciation, while she might not agree with the risk involved.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that the husband is using the joint investment portfolio suggests that he's mixing her inheritance with their shared funds. This could complicate things legally if they ever need to determine separate versus joint assets, especially in case of a divorce or other legal matters. The wife might not be aware of how her inheritance is being used and could face financial repercussions if the investment goes south.\n\nIn summary, even if the husband had legal authority during the grieving period, using a significant portion of her inheritance without her knowledge for a personal investment is ethically questionable and likely legally problematic. The lack of transparency and the potential financial risk involved without her consent makes it more than just a personal decision; it affects both parties' financial futures. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because he violated his wife's trust and possibly breached legal responsibilities regarding her inheritance.\n"
