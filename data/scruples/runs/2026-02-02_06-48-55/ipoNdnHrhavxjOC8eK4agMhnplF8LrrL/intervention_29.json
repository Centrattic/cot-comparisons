We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person in this AITA scenario is in the wrong. Let me break down the details.\n\nThe husband used his wife's inheritance to buy a new property in Colorado without her knowledge. He had legal authority to handle her mother's affairs because she was grieving, but he didn't consult her about spending 40% of the inheritance. He put the rest into their joint portfolio. His reasoning is that he wanted to take advantage of the market opportunity and didn't want to burden her with financial decisions while she was grieving. Now he's considering telling her or using it if she doesn't like it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. He had legal authority to handle the affairs, so maybe using the inheritance wasn't illegal. But legally doesn't always mean ethically. The key here is the lack of communication and consent. The wife gave him authority to manage her mother's estate, not to spend her inheritance on a personal purchase. Even if she was grieving, the inheritance is her money. Using a significant portion (40%) without discussing it with her seems like a breach of trust. \n\nMarriage usually involves shared financial decisions, especially when using a large sum like an inheritance. The husband's actions were secretive, which is a big red flag. He might have thought he was acting in their best interest, but the method\u2014hiding it\u2014could be problematic. The wife might feel disrespected and untrusted. The surprise plan is risky because if she's upset, it could cause major conflict. \n\nAlso, the husband's reasons don't fully justify the secrecy. He mentions the kid being gone and financial freedom, but the inheritance is her personal asset. The fact that he didn't wait to discuss it shows a lack of consideration for her wishes and financial autonomy. Even if the investment is good, the decision to use her money for a new home (which they might not both agree on) is a big step without her input.\n\nSo, while he might not be legally at fault, ethically and in terms of trust within the marriage, he's in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
