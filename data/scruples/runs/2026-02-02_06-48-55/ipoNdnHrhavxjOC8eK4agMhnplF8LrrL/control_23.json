We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for secretly using his wife's inheritance to buy a new property. \n\nFirst, the key points: The wife gave the author legal authority to handle her mother's affairs while she was grieving. The author used 40% of the inheritance to buy a house in Colorado and put the rest into their joint portfolio. The author didn't tell her about the purchase, planning to surprise her later.\n\nNow, considering legal and ethical aspects. Legally, if the wife gave him authority to manage the inheritance, maybe he had the power to do so. But ethical issues arise because he made a significant financial decision without her knowledge. Even if she was grieving, major decisions like spending a large portion of an inheritance should be discussed. The author didn't mention consulting her after the initial authority, just acted on his own.\n\nAlso, the house was bought with the idea of possibly moving there, which affects their shared future. The wife's financial conservatism versus his more aggressive approach isn't the main issue here\u2014it's about transparency. Trust is a big part of a marriage, and keeping such a big decision a secret could be seen as a breach of trust.\n\nEven though the intention was to benefit both, the method of making the decision without her input is questionable. The author's plan to \"visit it once a month and see how she feels\" suggests he's aware it might not be well-received. The surprise element is risky and could lead to conflict if the wife is upset. \n\nIn many relationships, major financial decisions are made together, especially when using shared or jointly controlled funds. The inheritance was hers, but the joint portfolio part complicates things. Using her money without her knowledge, even with authority, seems ethically wrong because it's a significant life decision affecting both of them. \n\nSo, even if legally he might have had the authority, ethically, he's in the wrong for not being transparent. The answer is A.\n"
