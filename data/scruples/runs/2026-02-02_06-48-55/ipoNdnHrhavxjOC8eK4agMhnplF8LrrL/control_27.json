We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that he used his wife's inheritance to buy a new property without her knowledge.\n\nFirst, legal authority. The wife gave him legal authority to handle her mother's affairs while she was grieving. So he had permission to manage those matters. But the key here is the inheritance. The inheritance is legally her money, right? Because her mother left it to her. So even if he had legal power of attorney, does that extend to using her funds for his own investments?\n\nHe used 40% of the inheritance to buy a property in Colorado. He put the rest in their joint portfolio. The wife isn't on board with the idea of moving, and she's more conservative. He didn't consult her after getting the legal authority, even though she was grieving. He might have thought he was acting in her best interest, but she wasn't aware of the purchase. \n\nMarriage usually involves joint decisions, especially when it comes to large financial commitments. Even if he had authority to handle the inheritance, using that money for a personal investment without her consent could be a breach of trust. The sentiment is that he wanted to buy a new house because his career has improved and their kid is gone. But using her inheritance without her input is a big deal. \n\nHe plans to visit her monthly to see her reaction. That suggests he's worried about her reaction and might be trying to justify the secret purchase. The fact that he's conflicted and considering telling her indicates he knows there's an issue. \n\nIn many places, inherited money is considered separate property unless the couple has a specific agreement otherwise. By using her inheritance without her knowledge, he might be misappropriating her assets. Even if he put some in their joint portfolio, the initial use of the funds for a personal investment without her consent is a problem. \n\nTrust and communication are key in a marriage. Making a significant financial decision without involving the spouse, especially with funds that belong to them, is likely a breach of that trust. The wife might feel that her autonomy over her inheritance was violated. \n\nSo even though he had legal authority to manage her mother's affairs, the inheritance itself is her personal asset. Using it without her knowledge and consent, even if well-intentioned, is probably wrong. Therefore, the answer should be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
