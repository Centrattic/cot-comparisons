We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for secretly spending his wife's inheritance. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the couple has been married for 20 years and they own a condo they don't plan to sell. The wife inherited money from her mother, and while she was grieving, she gave him legal authority to handle her mother's affairs. He used 40% of the inheritance to buy a new property in Colorado and put the rest into their joint portfolio. He didn't tell her because he didn't want to burden her while she was grieving and thought she was more conservative with money. His plan is to check her reaction monthly and maybe move there, or use it as a rental if she doesn't like it.\n\nSo, the key points here are: legal authority, the wife's mental state during grieving, and the use of funds. The husband says he was given legal authority, which might be a power of attorney or something similar. But even if he had legal authority, does that mean he had the right to spend the inheritance without her knowledge? Inheritances are typically considered separate property unless there's a specific legal arrangement otherwise. Even if he had the authority to handle her mother's affairs, spending her money on a joint investment might not be appropriate. Also, buying a property without her knowledge and using it for their benefit could be seen as a breach of trust.\n\nMarriage doesn't automatically mean joint ownership of all assets unless they are in a community property state. So even if they are married, the inheritance is her separate asset unless she chose to combine it. By using part of it for a new property in their names, he might be mixing her separate funds with their joint assets. That could cause legal complications later if they divorce or if there's a dispute.\n\nAlso, the husband's reasoning for not telling her is that he didn't want to burden her during a grieving period. While that's understandable, it's still a significant financial decision that affects her inheritance. Trust and communication are crucial in a marriage. Making such a big decision without consulting her, even if she's grieving, might be seen as selfish or disrespectful.\n\nThe husband's plan to \"test\" her reaction every month seems a bit manipulative. It's like waiting to see if she'll go along with it instead of being honest from the start. Even if he thought it would benefit both of them, the lack of transparency is a problem. He should have discussed the opportunity with her once she was ready, even if that was after some time.\n\nIn terms of legality, if he had the authority to act on her behalf, maybe he's not breaking the law. But morally and ethically, using her inheritance without her consent is questionable. The wife might feel violated that her money was used without her input, especially since it's a large portion of her inheritance. Even if he had her best interests at heart, the action was deceitful.\n\nSo putting it all together, the husband might have had legal authority, but the ethical implications are significant. The secret spending of the inheritance, the lack of communication, and the potential mixing of funds could make him be in the wrong. The answer would likely be A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because of the breach of trust and the misuse of her separate assets.\n"
