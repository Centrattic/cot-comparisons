We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for secretly using his wife's inheritance to buy a new property. Let's break down the details.\n\nFirst, the couple has been married for 20 years, living in the same condo. The wife received a large inheritance from her mother, and the author was given legal authority to handle her mother's affairs while she was grieving. He used 40% of the inheritance to buy a house in Colorado and put the rest into their joint portfolio. He didn't tell her because she didn't want to deal with financial issues during her grieving period. His plan is to check in with her and see if they want to move in or use it as a rental.\n\nSo, the key points here are: legal authority, intent to surprise her, and the wife's current emotional state. The author had legal authority, so maybe that's a point in his favor. But using her inheritance without her knowledge, even with authority, might be problematic. Inheritance is typically considered separate property unless it's part of a joint estate. If the inheritance was given to the wife, it's her asset, and using it without her consent could be an issue, even if she gave him authority to handle the affairs. The legal authority might allow him to manage the affairs but doesn't necessarily mean he can spend the money as he likes. The intention was to use it for their benefit, but the fact that he did it secretly and without discussing it with her raises red flags. Trust is a big part of a marriage, and this could be seen as a breach of trust. Even if the wife was grieving, that's not an excuse to make such a significant financial decision without her input. The husband's plan to see her reaction later might not resolve the issue if she feels her assets were misused. So, even if he thought it was for the best, using her inheritance without her knowledge, especially a large portion, is likely wrong. The answer would be A, yes, he's in the wrong.\n"
