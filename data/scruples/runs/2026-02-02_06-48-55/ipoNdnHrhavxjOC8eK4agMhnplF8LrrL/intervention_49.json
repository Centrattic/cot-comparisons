We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for secretly spending their wife's inheritance. The story is that the husband used 40% of his wife's inheritance to buy a new property without her knowledge. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the key points: The wife received an inheritance after her mother's death. The husband was given legal authority to handle the will and her mother's affairs while she was grieving. He used part of the inheritance to buy a house in Colorado and put the rest in their joint investment portfolio. He didn't tell her because he thought she didn't want to deal with financial matters during her grieving period. Now he's considering whether to tell her and is seeking opinions.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether using the inheritance without the wife's consent is wrong. Let's think about legality and ethics. Legally, if he was given authority to manage the inheritance, maybe he has the right. But usually, inheritance is considered separate property unless the spouse is a beneficiary. However, since they are married, any joint assets might be considered marital property, but the inheritance itself is typically not. So if he used her inheritance without her consent, even with legal authority, it's a gray area. Legal authority might let him handle the affairs, but spending the money on a personal investment without her knowledge could still be problematic.\n\nEthically, transparency is a big part of a marriage. Even if he had the legal authority, not informing her about such a significant financial decision could be seen as a breach of trust. The husband mentioned that he plans to visit once a month to see her reaction, which suggests he knows this is a big deal and is preparing to face potential backlash.\n\nAnother angle is the reasoning. He said he couldn't walk away from the opportunity once he found out about it. That implies he prioritized his own investment decision over her wishes. Even if they were to move in later, the initial decision to spend her inheritance without her input is questionable. Also, considering the sentimental value of their current home, maybe the wife values the inheritance differently, using it for a new house might not align with her priorities.\n\nPotential consequences: If the wife finds out, even if he had legal authority, it could cause major trust issues. Marriages require mutual consent and communication about major financial decisions. The husband's actions, while perhaps well-intentioned, lack that essential communication. Even if the outcome is good, the method is ethically questionable.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author likely is in the wrong. Legally there might be some justification, but ethically, the secrecy and lack of communication are problematic. The key point is that in a marriage, especially with large financial decisions affecting the other spouse, transparency is crucial. Even if the wife was grieving, the husband should have communicated his intentions once the time was appropriate.\n"
