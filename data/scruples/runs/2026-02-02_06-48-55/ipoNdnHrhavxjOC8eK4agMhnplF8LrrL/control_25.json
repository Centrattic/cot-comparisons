We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for secretly spending his wife's inheritance. \n\nFirst, the key points: The husband used 40% of the inheritance to buy a new property without the wife's knowledge. He had legal authority to handle her mother's affairs, but she gave that authority to him during her grieving period. The husband claims he did it because she didn't want to deal with financial issues at the time. \n\nNow, legal authority doesn't necessarily mean the wife intended for him to spend the inheritance on a new home. Typically, inheritance is the recipient's to manage as they see fit, but since it was given to the wife, using it without her consent could be an issue. Even if he had authority to handle the affairs, spending the money on a personal investment might go beyond what she authorized. \n\nAlso, the husband's reasoning is that he had an opportunity in Colorado and didn't want to miss it. But he didn't consult her, which is a major financial decision affecting both of them. Even if the plan is to check her feelings later, the secrecy and lack of communication are problematic. \n\nMarriage involves trust and transparency, especially with large sums of money. The inheritance isn't joint property unless specified, so using it without her input, even if she's grieving, might be seen as overstepping. The husband's intention to use the property as a rental or sell it shows he's considering alternative uses, which the wife might not agree with. \n\nIn terms of ethics, even if legally possible, the moral aspect of transparency in a marriage is important. The wife might feel betrayed or disrespected, which could harm their relationship. So, the author likely is in the wrong because he made a significant financial decision without his wife's consent, despite having her authority for handling affairs, which might not include spending her inheritance on a personal investment.\n"
