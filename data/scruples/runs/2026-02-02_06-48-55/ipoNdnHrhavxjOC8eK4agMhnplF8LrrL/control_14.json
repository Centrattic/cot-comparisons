We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for secretly spending their wife's inheritance. \n\nFirst, the key points: They were given legal authority by their wife to handle her mother's affairs while she was grieving. They used 40% of the inheritance to buy a new property in Colorado and put the rest in their joint portfolio. They didn't tell her about the purchase yet, planning to see how she feels when they visit.\n\nNow, legal authority is important here. If the wife explicitly gave them permission to handle her mother's affairs, that's a point in their favor. But the inheritance is hers, so even with authority, using a portion without her knowledge might be an issue. The question is about trust and communication.\n\nMarriage usually involves shared financial decisions, especially when it's a large sum like an inheritance. Even if the wife was grieving, the husband made a significant financial decision without discussing it with her. The intent to check later doesn't negate the initial secrecy. \n\nThere's also the aspect of using joint authority. The wife might have expected him to handle the affairs but not to spend the inheritance on a new property. The husband's reasoning about the market opportunity might be valid, but the lack of transparency is a red flag. Trust is crucial in a marriage, and this could be seen as a breach of that trust.\n\nIn terms of legal vs. moral wrong, legally he might have the authority, but morally, acting without her input on such a big purchase could be problematic. The fact that he plans to visit monthly to gauge her reaction shows he's aware of possible issues, which suggests he knows there's a problem here.\n\nSo, even if the legal aspect is okay, the ethical side\u2014keeping such a big decision a secret\u2014likely means he's in the wrong. The answer would be A.\n"
