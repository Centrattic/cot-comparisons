We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for secretly spending their wife's inheritance. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the key facts: The husband used 40% of his wife's inheritance to buy a new property in Colorado without her knowledge. He had legal authority to handle her mother's affairs because she was grieving and gave him that authority. But he used part of the inheritance for their joint benefit, thinking it would be good for them to move. The rest he put into their joint portfolio.\n\nNow, the ethical question. The wife is described as more conservative, so she might not have wanted to spend the inheritance on a new property. By not discussing it with her, especially since she was grieving and already gave him authority to handle the will, he might have overstepped. Even if he had good intentions, using someone else's inheritance without their explicit consent is a big deal. Inheritance is personal property, and while the husband was acting on her authority for the will, that doesn't necessarily mean he had permission to use the money for a new house. The wife might have different financial priorities or emotional attachments to the inheritance. \n\nAlso, the husband's reasoning that he couldn't wait for the opportunity in Colorado seems a bit self-serving. He should have waited until she was ready to discuss financial decisions. The fact that he's planning to surprise her adds to the secrecy. Even if he plans to check in with her later, the initial act of using the funds without her input is problematic. Financial transparency in a marriage is crucial, and this action shows a lack of communication and respect for her autonomy over her own money. \n\nSo, even though he had the legal authority to handle the will, using the funds without her consent for a personal investment is ethically wrong. The inheritance is hers, and he shouldn't have made that decision without her. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
