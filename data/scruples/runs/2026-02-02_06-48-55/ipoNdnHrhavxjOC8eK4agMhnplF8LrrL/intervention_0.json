We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for secretly using their wife's inheritance to buy a new property. \n\nFirst, the inheritance is their wife's money. She gave him authority to handle her mother's affairs, but does that include spending 40% of it on a new house without her consent? Probably not. Even if she was grieving, giving someone legal authority to handle affairs doesn't mean they can spend large sums without the owner's knowledge. That's a big chunk of money, and the wife might not have wanted it used this way.\n\nThe husband's reasoning is that he wanted to act on a good investment opportunity and didn't want to burden her during her grieving. But that's a risky move. Trust is crucial in a marriage, and secretly using her money like that could damage their relationship. Even if the intention was good, the action was a breach of trust. \n\nHe also mentions using the rest in their joint portfolio, which might be better than using it all on a house, but still, the main issue is the lack of communication. The wife might have different priorities for her inheritance, like saving it or using it for something else. By not discussing it with her first, he's made a decision that affects her financially without her input.\n\nThe plan to visit the house and see her reaction is a bad idea. It's not about surprising her with something that cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. The husband should have had an open conversation before making the purchase. The fact that he's now considering whether to tell her shows he knows it's a problem. \n\nIn the end, even if the investment turns out well, the secrecy is the main issue. Financial decisions, especially involving a spouse's personal funds, require mutual agreement. So yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
