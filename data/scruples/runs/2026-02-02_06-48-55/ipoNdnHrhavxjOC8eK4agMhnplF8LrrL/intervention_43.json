We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that he secretly used his wife's inheritance to buy a new property without her knowledge. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The wife gave him legal authority to handle her mother's affairs while she was grieving. He used 40% of the inheritance to buy a house in Colorado and put the rest into their joint portfolio. His reasoning is that she didn't want to deal with financial matters during her grieving period, and he saw a good investment opportunity.\n\nNow, the ethical issues here. Even though he had legal authority, the inheritance belongs to his wife. The legal authority might cover handling the affairs (like paying debts, closing accounts, etc.), but using a portion of the inheritance without her consent could be problematic. The inheritance is her personal asset unless they have a specific agreement otherwise. \n\nTrust is a big factor in a marriage. By not informing her about such a significant decision, he might have broken that trust. The fact that he plans to check her reaction later doesn't negate the initial secrecy. Also, the house he bought is for himself and possibly future plans, which might not align with her wishes. Even if the investment is sound, the method of handling it without transparency is questionable.\n\nHowever, there's a counterpoint: he acted under the given legal authority and perhaps thought he was helping by making a good investment. But the key here is that the inheritance is hers, and using it without her knowledge, regardless of intentions, might be seen as misuse of her assets. The legal authority might not extend to spending the money without her input, especially on a major purchase like a house.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author is in the wrong because he used his wife's money without her knowledge, even if he had legal authority. The lack of transparency and respect for her ownership of the inheritance is the main issue here.\n"
