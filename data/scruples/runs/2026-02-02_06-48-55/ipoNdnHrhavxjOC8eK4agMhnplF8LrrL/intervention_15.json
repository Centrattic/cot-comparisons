We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for secretly spending their wife's inheritance.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The husband used 40% of his wife's inheritance to buy a new property in Colorado and put the rest into their joint investment portfolio. He did this without her knowledge, claiming she was grieving and didn't want to deal with financial issues. He also mentions that he had been eyeing this market for a while and couldn't pass up the opportunity.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the wife's inheritance, the husband's unauthorized use of a significant portion of it, the lack of prior discussion, and the potential consequences. \n\nInheritance is typically considered personal property, especially in many states where it's not part of marital assets. Even if the couple is married, unless they're in a community property state, the inheritance belongs solely to the wife. The husband didn't consult her or get her consent, which is a big red flag. Using someone else's money without their knowledge, even if they were grieving, is a breach of trust. \n\nThe husband's reasoning is that he was taking care of her affairs as she asked him to, but that doesn't justify using a large portion of the inheritance without her input. The fact that he kept it a secret and made a major financial decision on her behalf could lead to serious conflict. Even if the investment might be beneficial, the lack of transparency is a major issue. \n\nAlso, the husband's plan to see if she likes the new property and then decide whether to move in or rent it out shows that he's not considering her autonomy over her own money. The wife might have had different plans for the inheritance, and he's essentially making assumptions about how she should use it. \n\nIn terms of legal implications, depending on the state, the wife could have the right to reclaim the funds or take legal action. But even if there's no legal issue, the ethical and relational aspects are clear. Trust is a cornerstone of marriage, and this action would likely damage that trust irreparably. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the husband's actions were wrong. He violated his wife's trust, made a significant financial decision without her consent, and used her personal funds for a joint investment without her knowledge. Even if the outcome could be positive, the means were unethical.\n"
