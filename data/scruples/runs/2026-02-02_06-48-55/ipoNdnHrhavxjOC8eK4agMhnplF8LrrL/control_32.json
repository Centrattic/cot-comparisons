We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the husband is in the wrong for using his wife's inheritance without her knowledge. \n\nFirst, the wife gave him legal authority to handle her mother's affairs during her grieving period. He used that to spend 40% on a new property and the rest in their joint portfolio. But he did so without her consent, even though she was preoccupied.\n\nLegal authority doesn't necessarily mean he can make such a big financial decision on his own. Inheritances are typically considered the recipient's personal property, especially since she's the sole heir. Even if he had authority to manage the affairs, spending a large portion on a house without her knowledge crosses a line. Marital trust is important, and this action could breach that trust. \n\nHe had a plan to see her reaction later, but that's not how financial decisions should be made. Transparency in a marriage is key, and this secret purchase might cause future conflicts. Also, using the inheritance for a joint purchase or another property without her input could be seen as taking advantage of her vulnerable state. \n\nEven if the intention was to benefit both, the method is questionable. The husband should have discussed it with her once she was ready, rather than acting unilaterally. So, the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
