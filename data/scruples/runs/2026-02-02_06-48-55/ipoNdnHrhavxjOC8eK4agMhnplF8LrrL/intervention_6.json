We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for secretly using their wife's inheritance to buy a new property. They had legal authority to handle her mother's affairs because she was grieving and gave them power of attorney. But they used 40% of the inheritance without her knowledge.\n\nFirst, legal authority doesn't necessarily mean full permission to spend the money as they see fit. Even if the wife gave them the authority to sort out her mother's affairs, that doesn't automatically include using the inheritance for their own real estate investment. The inheritance belongs to the wife, so using it without her consent, even with legal authority, might be overstepping. The husband's intention is to buy a new house, which he plans to use or rent out. That's a personal financial decision, and using someone else's inheritance for that without their input is a big deal.\n\nAlso, the wife is described as more conservative with money, so she might not have wanted to spend the inheritance on real estate, especially in a different state. The husband's decision could put them in financial or legal trouble if the wife objects. Even though he mentions he'll check with her later, the secrecy is a problem. Transparency is key in a marriage, especially regarding major financial decisions. The fact that he's worried about her reaction and considering telling her now suggests he knows it's a risky move.\n\nSo, even though he had a reason to handle the will, using the inheritance without her knowledge for their own purposes is a breach of trust. The answer is A.\n"
