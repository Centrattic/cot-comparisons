We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that he used his wife's inheritance to buy a property without her knowledge. First, inheritance is typically considered separate property, right? So even if they're married, the wife's inheritance is hers alone. The author had legal authority to handle her mother's affairs, but he used 40% of the inheritance to buy a house in Colorado. \n\nHe said he did it without her knowledge because she was grieving and didn't want to deal with financial stuff. But even with her permission to sort through the affairs, using the inheritance money without her knowledge for a personal investment seems like a problem. He might have thought he had the authority, but spending someone else's money without their consent is usually a big no-no. \n\nAlso, the house he bought is in his name? Or in their joint name? If it's joint, then using her money without her input is a breach of trust. Even if he plans to tell her later, the fact that he didn't inform her upfront is an issue. The wife might have different financial priorities, especially since she's more conservative. She might not want to invest in real estate, especially in another state. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that it could benefit both, but he decided unilaterally. Financial decisions, especially large ones involving someone else's money, should be mutual. Even though he had her permission to handle her mother's affairs, that doesn't extend to making purchases without her. The key here is consent. He didn't get her permission to use the inheritance for this purchase. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author likely is in the wrong because he spent his wife's inheritance without her knowledge, even if he had her permission to handle the estate. The inheritance is her separate property, and using it without her agreement is a breach of trust and possibly illegal. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n"
