We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the husband spending his wife's inheritance without her knowledge. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The husband and wife have been married for 20 years, living in the same condo. The husband used 40% of the wife's inheritance (from her mother's will) to buy a new property in Colorado and put the rest in their joint portfolio. He did this without telling her, claiming she was grieving and didn't want to deal with finances. He thought it was a good investment and plans to check her reaction later.\n\nSo, the key points here are: 1) the inheritance is the wife's, 2) the husband spent it without her consent, 3) he used it for a personal investment (buying a house in Colorado), 4) he gave her the choice later. \n\nNow, inheritance is typically considered the individual's property, even in a marriage. Unless there's a specific law in their state that makes it marital property, the wife's inheritance is hers alone. By using 40% of it for his own investment, the husband might have violated her property rights. Also, the fact that he took legal authority to handle her mother's affairs doesn't necessarily mean he can spend her inheritance. Legal authority might be about managing assets but not necessarily liquidating them for personal use. \n\nThe husband's reasoning is that he did it without her knowledge because she didn't want to deal with financial matters while grieving. But that doesn't justify using her money without her consent. Trust and communication are key in a marriage. Even if the opportunity was good, the husband should have discussed it with her, even if she was grieving. \n\nThe plan to check her reaction later is a bit of a cop-out. He's assuming she might like it, but if she doesn't, he can sell it. However, the fact that he made the decision unilaterally is a problem. The investment risk is on her now if the property doesn't appreciate as expected. Also, the joint portfolio part\u2014using the rest in their account might be okay if they usually manage finances together, but the main issue is the 40% spent on the property.\n\nIn most jurisdictions, spouses don't have automatic rights to each other's separate property. So, unless there's a marital agreement that allows the husband to manage her assets, this would be a breach of trust and possibly illegal. Also, the husband's intention to use it as a rental or sell it if she doesn't like it shows he made a unilateral decision, which is problematic.\n\nTherefore, the husband is in the wrong because he used his wife's inheritance without her consent for his own investment, which is both ethically and legally questionable.\n"
