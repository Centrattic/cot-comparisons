We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for secretly using his wife's inheritance to buy a house in Colorado. \n\nFirst, the key points from the scenario: The husband used 40% of his wife's inheritance without her knowledge to purchase a property. He had legal authority to handle her mother's affairs, but he didn't consult her about this specific purchase. His reasoning was that she was grieving and didn't want to deal with financial matters. He plans to check in on her feelings about it later.\n\nNow, considering legal aspects. The husband had legal authority given by the wife to handle her mother's affairs. But does that extend to making a large financial decision like buying a property? Legal authority usually has specific limits. If the will only allowed him to manage the affairs, like settling the estate, but not to spend the inheritance on personal investments, he might be overstepping. Also, the inheritance is the wife's personal asset, not joint property unless specified otherwise. Even if it's joint, using a portion without consent could be problematic.\n\nEthically, the main issue is consent. The wife didn't agree to this use of her inheritance. The husband decided unilaterally, which could be seen as a breach of trust. Even if his intentions were good\u2014like wanting to use the money for their benefit\u2014without her input, it's a major decision. Financial decisions of this scale typically require mutual agreement in a marriage, especially when it involves a spouse's personal inheritance.\n\nThe husband's justification is that she was grieving and didn't want to deal with financial issues. But that doesn't absolve him of the responsibility to communicate. He should have waited until she was ready or at least discussed it with her, even if she was upset. The fact that he acted without informing her, despite having her authority for managing the will, doesn't make it right. The authority given for handling the will might not include personal financial investments unless explicitly stated.\n\nAlso, the plan to visit the property monthly and then decide based on her reaction seems like a way to avoid accountability. The surprise aspect could lead to significant conflict if she's not comfortable with the decision. The husband's confidence that it will \"clearly benefit both\" is subjective and assumes her agreement without her input.\n\nIn summary, while there might be legal gray areas depending on the specifics of the authority given, ethically, the husband made a major financial decision without his wife's consent, which is a breach of trust and marital expectations. Therefore, he's in the wrong.\n"
