We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the husband is in the wrong for secretly using his wife's inheritance to buy a house. \n\nFirst, the inheritance is legally hers. Even though he had authority to handle her mother's affairs, the money is hers. Using 40% without her consent seems like a major issue. The key point here is that he had legal authority but didn't discuss this big financial decision with her, especially when she was grieving. \n\nHe mentions she didn't want to deal with financial matters during her grief, but that doesn't mean she waived all control over her inheritance. Using a significant portion of it for a personal investment without her knowledge crosses a line. Even if the intention was to benefit both of them, the lack of transparency and her lack of consent is problematic. \n\nAdditionally, the husband's plan to \"visit it once a month\" implies he's not being upfront. He's keeping this a secret, which shows a lack of trust and respect for her autonomy. The fact that he's considering selling or renting it if she doesn't like it further indicates he didn't really consider her desires. \n\nIn a marriage, major financial decisions typically require mutual agreement. By making this decision unilaterally, especially with her inheritance, he's violating that trust. Even if he saw an opportunity, he should have waited until she was ready to discuss it. The emotional aspect of her grieving adds another layer of sensitivity.\n\nSo, the answer is A\u2014Yes, the author is in the wrong because he misused his wife's inheritance without her consent and acted without transparency.\n"
