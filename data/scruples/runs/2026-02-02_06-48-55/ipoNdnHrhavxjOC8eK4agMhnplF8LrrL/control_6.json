We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the person wrote on Reddit about secretly spending their wife's inheritance. Let's break down the situation.\n\nThe wife inherited a large sum from her mother, and the husband was given legal authority to handle the affairs while she was grieving. He used 40% of the inheritance to buy a new property in Colorado and put the rest in their joint portfolio. The key points here are whether the husband had the right to use the inheritance without her knowledge and the implications of that.\n\nFirst, legal authority. The husband says he was given legal authority to handle the will's implications. But does that authority include spending a significant portion of the inheritance on a new property? Typically, handling affairs might involve things like closing accounts, distributing assets, or managing the estate, but using a large portion for a personal purchase might not be covered by that. Unless the will specifically gave him such authority, which he didn't mention, it's possible he overstepped.\n\nSecond, the inheritance is the wife's personal asset. Even though they are married, in many jurisdictions, an inheritance is considered separate property. So, using it without her consent could be a breach of trust. The husband might have thought he was acting in their best interest, but the wife's consent is crucial, especially for a major decision like buying a house.\n\nHe also mentions that they have a joint investment portfolio, so putting the remaining money there might mix her separate inheritance with their joint funds. That could complicate things legally if there's a dispute later. \n\nThe husband's reasoning was that she didn't want to deal with financial issues while grieving, but that's not a valid excuse for making such a significant decision without her input. The wife has the right to make decisions about her inheritance, even if she's grieving. He could have waited until she was ready to discuss it. \n\nThe plan to visit the property monthly and see her reaction is risky. If she finds out and is upset, it could cause major marital issues. Trust is essential in a marriage, and this action might erode that trust. Even if the husband believed it was for the best, the lack of transparency is a red flag.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the husband likely acted unethically and possibly illegally by using his wife's inheritance without her consent. The answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
