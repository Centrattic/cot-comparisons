We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for secretly using his wife's inheritance. The situation is that the wife inherited money from her mother and gave him legal authority to handle the will. He used 40% of it to buy a new property in Colorado without her knowledge, planning to either move there or rent it out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Since the wife gave him legal authority to handle her mother's affairs, maybe he had the right to make decisions about the inheritance. But inheritance is a sensitive topic. Even if he had authority, using a significant portion (40%) for a personal investment without discussing might be an issue. The key points here are consent and transparency.\n\nHe mentions that she was grieving and didn't want to deal with financial issues, which he took as an opening. But did he have explicit permission to use the money for real estate? The legal authority to sort through affairs might not necessarily mean he can make such a large investment. There's a difference between handling the will (like distributing funds to beneficiaries) and using the money for a personal property purchase.\n\nAlso, the fact that it's a joint investment portfolio\u2014does that mean the inheritance is now part of their marital assets? If they are legally married and the inheritance is considered separate property, using it without her consent could be problematic. But if she gave him authority, maybe it's not. However, even with authority, the ethical side is questionable. He kept it secret, which could damage trust. The plan to surprise her might backfire if she's upset about the decision.\n\nHe also mentions the sentimental value of their current home. Using her inheritance to buy a new property could be seen as prioritizing his own desires over her wishes, especially if she's conservative with finances. He might have acted on his own interests without considering her perspective. Even if the investment is sound, the lack of communication is an issue. Trust is crucial in a marriage, and this action could lead to resentment. So, even if legally he had the authority, ethically, he's in the wrong for not being transparent.\n"
