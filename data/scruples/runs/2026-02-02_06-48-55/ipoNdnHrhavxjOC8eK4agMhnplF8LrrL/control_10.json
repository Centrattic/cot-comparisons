We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that he used his wife's inheritance to buy a new property without her knowledge. \n\nFirst, the wife gave him legal authority to handle her mother's affairs while she was grieving. He used 40% of the inheritance to buy a house and the rest into their joint portfolio. The key question here is whether he overstepped his authority.\n\nLegal authority might cover handling the affairs, like settling the will, but using a significant portion of the inheritance for a personal purchase (a new property) could be questionable. Even if she was grieving, the inheritance is her money. He might have thought he was acting in her best interest, but using 40% without her consent is a big decision. Marital trust and transparency are big factors here. Even if the intention was good, the secrecy could be a problem. The wife might feel betrayed once she finds out, especially if she had a different mindset about finances. The author's justification of not wanting to burden her during grief might not excuse the lack of communication. So, from a moral standpoint, he probably acted selfishly by not discussing the major financial decision with her. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
