We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for secretly using his wife's inheritance to buy a property. First, I need to analyze the situation step by step.\n\nThe author and his wife have been married for 20 years. She received an inheritance from her mother, and he was given legal authority to handle the affairs while she was grieving. He used 40% of the inheritance to buy a house in Colorado and put the rest into their joint investment portfolio. He didn't tell her because she didn't want to deal with financial issues during her grieving period.\n\nThe key points here are the legal authority and the intent. He had legal authority, so maybe that's a point in his favor. But even with legal authority, using a significant portion of her inheritance without her knowledge might still be a problem. In many jurisdictions, inherited assets can be considered separate property, especially if the wife is the heir. Even if he had the legal power to manage the inheritance, spending it without consent could be an issue because the inheritance is her money. \n\nAlso, the author's reasoning is that he didn't want to burden her during her grieving. While that's understandable, it's important to consider whether he had the right to make such a large financial decision without her input. Even with the best intentions, making decisions about someone else's money, especially a life-changing amount, without their knowledge could be seen as overstepping, regardless of the legal authority. \n\nAnother angle is the concept of marital trust and transparency. Even if legally he had the right, the act of hiding such a major purchase might erode trust. The fact that he plans to reveal it later by visiting monthly shows he's aware of potential issues, but the secret action itself might be problematic. \n\nIn some cases, joint ownership might come into play if the inheritance is considered marital property, but typically inheritance is separate. However, mixing it into a joint portfolio could complicate things. \n\nSo, weighing these factors: legal authority might protect him in a court of law, but ethically and in terms of marital trust, he's likely in the wrong. The answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because he used her inheritance without her consent, even if he had the legal power. The intent doesn't absolve the act of breaching trust and transparency in a marriage.\n"
