We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for secretly using their wife's inheritance to buy a new house. They were given legal authority to handle her mother's affairs, but they spent 40% of the inheritance without telling her. The wife was grieving, so he didn't want to bother her with financial matters. His plan is to check in on her feelings about it later.\n\nHmm. Legal authority doesn't necessarily mean they can spend the money however they want. Even if they have power of attorney or something, using someone else's inheritance without their consent... that seems like a problem. Inheritance is typically the recipient's personal money, right? So even if he was handling the affairs, the money belongs to his wife. Spending 40% of it without her knowledge, especially on a personal investment like a house, crosses a line. \n\nAlso, the fact that he used the money for a new property in Colorado, which he wants to maybe move into or rent out. The wife might not be on board with that. The premise is that he thought it's for the benefit of both, but without her consent, it's a breach of trust. Marriages involve joint decisions, especially when it comes to large sums. Even if he had the legal power, the emotional and ethical aspect is important. \n\nHe mentions the wife is more conservative, so she might have had different plans for the inheritance. By using her money without her input, he's making a financial decision that affects their future together. That's a big deal. The justification about not wanting to bother her during grieving is a bit thin because the money is hers, and handling it without her input could lead to resentment. \n\nSo, yeah, the author is in the wrong because he used his wife's inheritance without her consent, even if he had legal authority. The ethical side is about trust and mutual decision-making in a marriage. Answer A.\n"
