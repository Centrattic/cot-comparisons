We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for secretly using their wife's inheritance to buy a new property.\n\nFirst, the wife gave the author legal authority to handle her mother's affairs while she was grieving. But does legal authority mean permission to spend the inheritance on a personal investment? Probably not. The inheritance is the wife's money, so even if she gave someone power of attorney, using it without her consent for a personal purchase seems like a no-go.\n\nThe author used 40% of the inheritance for a house in Colorado, which is a significant amount. The wife might not have wanted that money spent on real estate, especially since it's her inheritance. Even if the author's intention is to benefit both of them, the key issue is the lack of transparency and consent. Trust is crucial in a marriage, and keeping such a big financial decision secret could damage that trust.\n\nAlso, the author's plan to check her reaction later doesn't address the initial secrecy. The wife might feel betrayed, and the surprise could be seen as manipulative. Financial decisions of this magnitude should involve both partners, especially when dealing with someone else's inheritance. The author's actions, while perhaps well-intentioned, cross ethical lines by not being upfront with his spouse.\n"
