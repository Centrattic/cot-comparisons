We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for secretly spending their wife's inheritance. The wife gave them legal authority to handle her mother's affairs, and he used 40% of the inheritance to buy a new property in Colorado. The rest went into their joint portfolio. He didn't tell her because she was grieving and didn't want to deal with financial stuff.\n\nFirst, legal authority is mentioned. If he had legal power of attorney or something similar, he might have the right to act on her behalf. But even with legal authority, there's an ethical question. The inheritance is her money, and using part of it without her explicit consent, even if she gave him the power to handle the affairs, might be crossing a line. Especially since the purpose of the inheritance was for her mother's affairs, and he used a portion for his own investment.\n\nHe mentions the reason he didn't tell her was because she was grieving and said she didn't want to deal with financial issues. That's a common tactic people use to justify not communicating. But even if she was grieving, using someone else's money without their knowledge is problematic. The trust between spouses is important, and this could lead to serious issues. \n\nAlso, the fact that he's planning to visit the property monthly and see if she's okay with it shows he's aware there's a problem. He's conflicted, which suggests he knows he might be wrong. The key points here are consent, transparency, and the nature of the funds. The inheritance is her money, and while she gave him legal authority, that doesn't necessarily mean she intended for him to use it for purchasing a new home unless explicitly stated. \n\nThe author's actions could be seen as taking advantage of a vulnerable situation. Even if the legal aspect allows it, the ethical aspect is murky. The wife might feel violated or betrayed once she finds out, especially since the purchase is a significant financial decision. The potential for conflict is high, and the surprise plan to present it to her later doesn't address the initial lack of transparency. \n\nSo, considering the ethical implications and the trust aspect, even with legal authority, using someone's inheritance without their knowledge for a personal investment is wrong. The answer is A.\n"
