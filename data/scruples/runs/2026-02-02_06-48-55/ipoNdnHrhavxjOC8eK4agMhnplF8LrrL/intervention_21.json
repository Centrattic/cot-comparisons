We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband used his wife's inheritance to buy a new house in Colorado without her knowledge. He had legal authority to handle her mother's affairs, but he used 40% of the inheritance for the property and the rest into their joint portfolio.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. The wife gave him legal authority to sort through her mother's affairs. So maybe he had the legal right to handle the inheritance. But the inheritance is her money, so even with authority, using it without her consent might be an issue. Inheritance is typically considered separate property, especially if it's left directly to her. Even if he had power of attorney, using the funds for joint investments and another property without her agreement could be problematic.\n\nThen there's the moral aspect. The husband didn't consult his wife about using her inheritance. He made a big financial decision without discussing it with her, even though they're married. Marital trust and communication are important. The fact that he kept it a secret suggests he knew it might not be something she would agree with. She was grieving, which might have influenced her state of mind, and he took advantage of her vulnerability by not informing her.\n\nHe mentions that he plans to visit her once a month to gauge her reaction. That seems like a way to avoid direct confrontation and see how she'll react instead of being honest upfront. The surprise element might lead to conflict if she's upset about it. Even if the investment could benefit them, the method of using her inheritance without her input is ethically questionable.\n\nAlso, the husband's reasoning is that he wanted to take advantage of a financial opportunity. But using someone else's inheritance, even with authority, for a joint investment might not be the best use of her money. She might have had different plans for her inheritance, especially if she's more conservative. The fact that the property has appreciated shows that he might have made a good investment, but that doesn't justify the lack of transparency.\n\nIn many places, inheritance is separate property unless it's gifted to the couple. If the inheritance is separate, using it without consent could be a breach of trust or even grounds for legal action. Even if it's joint now, the initial act of using the inheritance without her knowledge is a problem. The husband's actions show a lack of respect for his wife's autonomy over her inherited funds.\n\nSo putting it all together, while he might have had legal authority, the ethical and moral issues are significant. The trust between spouses is compromised, and the wife's emotional state during her mother's passing might have been a factor in her decision to let him handle the affairs, which he then used to make a major financial decision without her input. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
