We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. So, the situation is that the husband spent his wife's inheritance without her knowledge. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The couple has been married for 20 years, living in the same condo. The husband used 40% of her inheritance to buy a property in Colorado. He had legal authority from her to handle her mother's affairs during her grieving period. His reasoning is that he wanted to take advantage of the market and didn't want to pressure her during her emotional time.\n\nNow, the key points to consider: Legal authority. The wife did give him the legal authority to handle the will. But does that extend to spending her inheritance? Maybe, but maybe not. The legal authority might be for managing the affairs, not necessarily for making financial decisions on her behalf, especially significant ones like buying a house. Also, the inheritance is the wife's personal asset, so using it without her consent could be a big issue even if there's some authority given.\n\nAnother point is the intent. The husband's plan is to surprise her and see her reaction. If she's okay, they move in; if not, sell or rent. But surprise inheritance usage might not be the best approach. Even if the wife gave authority, the use of such a large portion of her inheritance for a new property might not be something she would endorse later. There's a potential for conflict here.\n\nSentimentality and financial decision-making. The husband mentions the condo has sentimental value. But this new investment in Colorado is a different matter. The wife's conservative mindset versus his more aggressive financial approach could lead to disagreements. Also, the husband didn't consult her after the initial authority was given, which is a red flag. Even if she was grieving, once she's able to handle financial matters, transparency is important.\n\nMoral aspect: Trust and communication. Using someone's inheritance without their knowledge, even with legal authority, can strain trust. The husband is hiding the purchase, which might come off as deceitful. Even if he thinks he's acting in their best interest, the lack of transparency is problematic.\n\nLegal vs. moral. Legally, maybe he's within his rights if the authority was broad. Morally, it's a different story. The wife's autonomy over her inheritance is a key factor. In many places, inheritance is considered separate property unless it's commingled into a joint account. However, if he used the authority to manage the affairs, using the funds without her knowledge might still be ethically wrong.\n\nAlso, the husband's reasoning about not wanting to burden her while grieving is understandable, but that doesn't absolve him from discussing major financial decisions later. He chose to act on his own, which could backfire if she finds out and feels her assets were misused.\n\nIn conclusion, while the husband might have had the legal authority to handle some aspects, the use of her inheritance for his investment without her consent is ethically questionable. The lack of communication and the potential for her to feel her assets were taken without her input makes him at fault. So, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
