We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for secretly using their wife's inheritance to buy a new property.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The husband and wife have been married for 20 years and live in a condo with sentimental value. The wife received a large inheritance from her mother, and the husband was given legal authority to handle her mother's affairs during her grieving period. He used 40% of the inheritance to buy a house in Colorado without her knowledge, putting the rest into their joint portfolio. The husband's reasoning is that he saw a good investment opportunity and didn't want to burden his wife during her grief. Now he's considering whether to tell her or not.\n\nSo, the key points here are: legal authority, intention to use the funds, and the secrecy involved. The husband had the authority to handle the will, which might mean he had permission to manage the inheritance. But using a significant portion (40%) without consulting her might be an issue. Even if he had the legal authority, the emotional aspect of the inheritance could be important. Inheritances are often seen as personal, and unless there's a specific clause stating how they should be used, it's usually up to the heir. However, in a marriage, there might be shared responsibilities and expectations. \n\nThe husband didn't consider his wife's perspective. She might have wanted to use the inheritance differently, especially since it's her money. The fact that he kept it a secret could be a major problem. Marital trust and communication are crucial. Even if the husband had good intentions, the lack of transparency is a red flag. Financial decisions of this magnitude typically require both partners' input, especially when using someone else's money. \n\nThe husband's plan to see how she feels later doesn't address the initial secrecy. He might be hoping for a positive reaction, but if she's upset about the unauthorized use of her inheritance, it could lead to bigger issues. The appreciation of the property might help, but it doesn't negate the ethical issue. \n\nIn many places, inherited money is considered separate property, but since it's in a joint portfolio and used to buy a property, there might be legal complications. Even if legally permissible, the ethical aspect is about respecting each other's wishes and involving each other in major decisions. The husband's actions could be seen as a breach of trust, regardless of the legal authority. So, I think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because he didn't communicate with his wife and used her inheritance without her consent, despite having the authority, which doesn't excuse the lack of transparency and mutual decision-making.\n"
