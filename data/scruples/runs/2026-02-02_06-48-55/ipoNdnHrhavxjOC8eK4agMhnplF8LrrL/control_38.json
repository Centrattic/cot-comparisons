We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person asks if the author is in the wrong for secretly using his wife's inheritance to buy a new property.\n\nFirst, the key points from the story: The husband took control of his wife's inheritance because she was grieving and gave him legal authority. He used 40% of it to buy a house in Colorado without her knowledge. His reasoning is that he saw a good investment opportunity and didn't want to miss it. He plans to check her reaction later.\n\nNow, considering legal and ethical aspects. Legally, if he had the authority, maybe he's okay there. But ethically, it's more complex. Using someone else's inheritance without their consent, even if they gave authority, could be questionable. The wife didn't know about the purchase and might not have agreed to how the inheritance was used. Inheritance is personal, and while the husband managed the affairs, the decision to spend such a large portion on a new property without her input might be seen as overstepping. Even if he had her permission to handle the will, spending the money without her knowledge for an investment (even if it's a good one) might not align with her wishes. Also, the husband's plan to surprise her with the purchase or sell it later could be seen as manipulative. The wife might feel disrespected or deceived. So ethically, the husband is likely in the wrong because transparency and mutual agreement are important in a marriage, especially when dealing with significant financial decisions involving someone else's money.\n"
