We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a husband who secretly spent his wife's inheritance to buy a new property.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The husband got legal authority from his wife to handle her mother's affairs because she was grieving. He used 40% of the inheritance to buy a house in Colorado without her knowledge. He rationalizes that she didn't want to deal with financial matters during her grief and he saw an investment opportunity. His plan is to check in with her monthly and adjust accordingly if she doesn't like the decision.\n\nNow, the main issue here is the unauthorized use of the inheritance. Even if he had legal authority, the inheritance belongs to the wife. Legal authority to handle her mother's affairs might cover things like distributing the inheritance as per the will, but using a portion of it for a joint investment without her consent could be problematic. The husband's intent was to use it for their benefit, but the act of spending someone else's money without explicit permission is a red flag.\n\nMarriage doesn't automatically mean joint ownership of all assets unless specified by law or agreement. In many places, inheritance is considered separate property. So, using her inheritance without her knowledge, even with legal authority for handling the affairs, might still be a breach of trust. The husband's decision to surprise her could be seen as manipulative, regardless of his intentions. Transparency in a relationship is crucial, and financial decisions, especially those involving significant sums, typically require mutual agreement.\n\nAdditionally, the husband's justification that he couldn't walk away from the opportunity might not hold up ethically. Even if he had legal authority to manage the inheritance (like distributing it), using it for personal investment without her consent isn't necessarily covered under that authority. The legal authority might be for administrative tasks, not financial decisions that impact the wife's assets.\n\nThe potential consequences if she discovers this could be severe, like financial loss, legal disputes, or broken trust. The husband's plan to visit monthly and see her reaction is reactive rather than proactive. He should have discussed the idea with her first, considering their differing mindsets on financial matters. His action of making a unilateral decision undermines their partnership and financial planning.\n\nIn summary, the husband is in the wrong because he used his wife's inheritance without her knowledge, even if he had legal authority to handle her mother's affairs. The unauthorized use of her personal funds violates trust and financial autonomy in the marriage.\n"
