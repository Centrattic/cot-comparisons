We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for secretly using his wife's inheritance to buy a new property. The author says he was given legal authority by his wife to handle her mother's affairs after her death. He used 40% of the inheritance to buy a house in Colorado and the rest into their joint portfolio. He didn't tell her because she was grieving and he didn't want to burden her.\n\nFirst, legal authority is key here. If the wife gave him explicit legal authority to handle her mother's affairs, then technically he might have the right to manage that money. However, using a portion of the inheritance without her knowledge could still be problematic, especially since inheritance is typically the recipient's personal asset unless specified otherwise in the will. Even if she gave him authority, she might not have authorized him to spend the money on a house. The line between managing affairs and spending the inheritance is crucial here. \n\nAlso, the author's reasoning is that he didn't want to burden her during her grieving period. While that's considerate, it doesn't necessarily justify making a large financial decision without her consent. The wife might have different priorities for her inheritance. The fact that he's using the house as a potential investment or rental might not align with her wishes. Even if he plans to discuss it with her, the act of spending her money without her input could be seen as a breach of trust. \n\nMoreover, the legal authority given might be for administrative purposes, like settling the estate, not for personal investments. So there could be legal issues if the will didn't explicitly allow that. Additionally, joint investment portfolios are shared, so adding the inheritance there might not have been transparent. \n\nIn terms of ethics and relationships, transparency is important. Even if he had the authority, withholding such a significant decision could harm their trust. The wife might feel disrespected or violated if she finds out later. The fact that he's nervous about telling her suggests he's aware of the potential wrongness. \n\nSo considering all these points, even if he had the legal authority, the ethical aspect of not consulting her and making a major financial decision without her input likely places the blame on him. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
