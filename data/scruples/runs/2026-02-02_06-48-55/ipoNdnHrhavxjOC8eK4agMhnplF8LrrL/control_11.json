We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is wrong for secretly using his wife's inheritance to buy a house. First, I need to break down the situation. The wife received an inheritance, and he was given legal authority to handle her mother's affairs. He used 40% of it to buy a property in Colorado without telling her. The main points here are consent, legal authority, and the reason behind his actions.\n\nHe was given legal authority, but does that mean he can use the money as he sees fit? Maybe the authority was to handle the affairs, like distributing the inheritance properly, not to spend it on personal investments. The fact that he used a portion for a joint investment portfolio might be okay if that's part of their shared finances, but buying a house without her consent seems like a major financial decision. Even though he had her instructions to handle things while she was grieving, that might not cover spending such a large amount on a personal project. The author mentions he wants to surprise her, which implies he didn't discuss it with her first. That's a red flag because major purchases usually require mutual agreement, especially when involving someone else's money. Also, the sentimental value of their current home vs. the new investment. He might be justifying it as for their future, but without her input, it's a big risk. The answer here is probably A because he acted without her consent, even with legal authority. The legal authority might be for administrative tasks, not personal financial decisions. So, he's in the wrong.\n"
