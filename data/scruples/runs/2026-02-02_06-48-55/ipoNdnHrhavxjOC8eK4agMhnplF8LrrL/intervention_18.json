We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the husband is wrong for secretly using his wife's inheritance. He had legal authority to handle her mother's affairs, but he used 40% of the inheritance to buy a new property without her knowledge.\n\nFirst, legal authority doesn't necessarily mean complete discretion. Just because she gave him power of attorney or legal authority to handle the will doesn't automatically give him the right to spend a significant portion on a personal investment. The key here is whether he had explicit permission to use the funds for that purpose. The wife mentioned she didn't want to deal with financial issues while grieving, but that's not a blanket approval for him to make large financial decisions.\n\nSecond, using a substantial portion of her inheritance without her knowledge is a red flag. Inheritances are typically considered separate property, especially if received by one spouse. Even in a long-term marriage, major financial decisions that affect a spouse's assets without their consent can be problematic. The husband's justification that he's acting in their best interest doesn't override the fact that he made a unilateral decision with her money.\n\nThird, the husband plans to present the purchase as a surprise, which shows a lack of transparency. Trust is crucial in a marriage, and this kind of action could lead to significant conflict. Even if the investment turns out well, the breach of trust is a major issue. The husband's reasoning that he couldn't walk away from the opportunity might be valid business-wise, but it doesn't excuse the lack of communication and consent.\n\nAlso, the husband's intention to use the property as a rental or sell it if she's unhappy implies that he's gambling with her money. The risk is hers, but the decision was made without her input. The sentimental value of their current home versus the new investment isn't a solid reason to bypass her autonomy over her inheritance.\n\nIn summary, despite the legal authority given during her mother's affairs, the husband's use of her inheritance without her knowledge crosses ethical and possibly legal boundaries. Trust and mutual consent in financial decisions are fundamental in a marriage, and this action undermines that. So, the answer is A.\n"
