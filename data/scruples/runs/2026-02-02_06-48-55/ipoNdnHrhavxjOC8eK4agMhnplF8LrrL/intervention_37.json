We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for secretly spending his wife's inheritance. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The husband used 40% of his wife's inheritance to buy a new property in Colorado without her knowledge. The wife was grieving her mother's death and had given him legal authority to handle the affairs. He claims she didn't want to deal with financial issues at the time, and he wanted to take advantage of a market opportunity.\n\nNow, the key points to consider. Legally, if the inheritance is the wife's personal property, then even with authority to handle her mother's affairs, using the funds without her consent might be questionable. The husband might have the legal authority to manage the estate, but using the inheritance funds for a personal investment (like buying a new home) without her consent could be a problem. Inheritance is typically considered separate property unless otherwise specified in a will or trust.\n\nEthically, the main issue is the lack of communication. The husband made a significant financial decision without discussing it with his wife. Even if he had her authority to handle the affairs, using a portion of the inheritance for a joint purchase (since the new property will be in their names?) without her knowledge is a breach of trust. The wife might have different financial priorities or expectations for the inheritance. The husband's justification that he didn't want to burden her during grieving doesn't excuse the lack of transparency, especially since the decision affects their shared financial future.\n\nAlso, the husband's plan to \"visit it once a month and see how she feels\" suggests he's uncertain about her reaction. This indicates he didn't consider her wishes beforehand, which is a red flag. Financial decisions of this magnitude should involve both partners to maintain trust and avoid conflicts.\n\nSo, putting it together: Legally, there might be issues if the inheritance was supposed to be her separate property. Ethically, the lack of discussion and the surprise approach are problematic. The husband acted unilaterally, which is a breach of trust in a marriage. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
