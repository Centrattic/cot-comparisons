We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is wrong for secretly using their wife's inheritance to buy a property. \n\nFirst, the key facts: The husband and wife have been married 20 years. The wife inherited money from her mother, and the husband was given legal authority to handle her mother's affairs during her grief. He used 40% of the inheritance to buy a house in Colorado, keeping it secret because he thought she didn't want to deal with finances during that time.\n\nSo, the main issues here are legal and ethical. Legally, the husband had authority to manage the affairs, but was he allowed to use the inheritance for his own investment? The inheritance was the wife's, so using it without her consent might be a problem, even if he was handling the will. He could argue that he had legal power of attorney, but that might be for handling the affairs, not necessarily disposing of the funds. \n\nEthically, there's a big issue. Marriages typically involve shared financial decisions, especially when it comes to large sums. Even if the wife was grieving, the husband should have discussed this with her once she was ready. His decision to make a major purchase without her knowledge could be seen as a breach of trust. The fact that he's now considering telling her and adjusting based on her reaction is a good sign, but the secrecy itself is problematic.\n\nAlso, the husband is using the wife's money for an investment that he benefits from. Even if he plans to share the proceeds, the initial decision to act unilaterally without her input is questionable. The wife might feel disrespected or manipulated, especially since the inheritance is hers. \n\nIn many places, joint decision-making is important in marriage, even if one spouse has control over certain matters during a crisis. The husband might have overstepped by using the inheritance without waiting for her to process the grief and make an informed choice. \n\nSo, considering both legal and ethical aspects, the husband is likely in the wrong. The answer should be A (Yes).\n"
