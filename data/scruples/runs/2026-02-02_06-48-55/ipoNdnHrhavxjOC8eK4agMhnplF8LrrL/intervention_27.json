We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for secretly spending his wife's inheritance. The situation is that he used 40% of her inheritance to buy a new property without her knowledge. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The wife gave him legal authority to handle her mother's affairs while she was grieving. He used that authority to spend part of the inheritance on a Colorado property. He didn't consult her after that, even though he plans to visit her to see her reaction later.\n\nThe main issue is the unauthorized use of her inheritance. Even if he had legal authority to handle the affairs, the inheritance is her personal asset. Using a significant portion (40%) without her knowledge, even if she was grieving, crosses into personal financial decisions. The legal authority might cover handling the affairs, like paying debts or closing accounts, but buying a property with her money isn't something she would typically delegate without specific instructions.\n\nAlso, the husband's justification is that he couldn't miss the opportunity, but that doesn't negate the fact that he made a major financial decision unilaterally. Trust and transparency in a marriage are crucial. Even if the wife was grieving, it's important to respect her autonomy over her inheritance. He might have thought he was acting in their best interest, but the lack of communication and consent is a problem. \n\nThe plan to check her reaction later is a bit of a \"wait and see\" approach, which isn't the best way to handle such a significant decision. The author is in a position where he's made a substantial investment that affects their joint finances without her input. That seems to be a breach of trust, even if the intent was to benefit both. So, I think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
