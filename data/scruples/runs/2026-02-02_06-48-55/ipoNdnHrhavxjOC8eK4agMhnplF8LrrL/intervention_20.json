We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband who secretly used 40% of his wife's inheritance to buy a new property without her knowledge.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In most jurisdictions, when a spouse inherits money, it's considered their separate property unless they are in a community property state. However, even in community property states, if the inheritance is given to one spouse specifically, it might still be considered their individual asset. But the husband had legal authority to manage her mother's affairs, which he obtained during her time of grieving. That's a key point. Did he have the right to use the funds without her consent beyond handling the will and affairs? Probably not. The inheritance was hers to do with as she wished, and using 40% of it without her knowledge crosses into misuse of authority, even if he had power of attorney.\n\nEthically, there's the issue of transparency in a marriage. Even if the husband thought he was acting in their best interest, not discussing such a significant financial decision undermines trust. The wife was grieving, which might make her more vulnerable. The husband's justification is that he wanted to avoid burdening her during that time, but that doesn't negate the fact that he made a major decision without her input. The surprise element could be seen as manipulative, especially when dealing with substantial financial matters that affect both partners.\n\nThe husband's plan to \"visit it once a month\" and see her reaction is not really a plan but a gamble. He's putting their relationship at risk for a potential financial gain. The fact that he's considering using it as a rental or reselling if she doesn't like it shows that he's prepared to take a risk with her money. This seems self-serving and disregards her autonomy over her inheritance.\n\nMoreover, the husband mentions that the wife is more conservative, implying that she might not have made the same decision. But that's not his call to make. Even if he had good intentions, using her money without her consent is a breach of trust and likely a violation of their mutual understanding in the marriage. The sentimental value of their current home is noted, but the new property purchase is a different matter entirely.\n\nIn terms of legal authority, if he had a power of attorney, it might be limited to specific tasks like handling the will and settling affairs, not making personal investments. Unless the power of attorney explicitly allowed him to make investments with her inheritance, this would be an overreach. Even if the power of attorney was broad, using her money for personal or joint financial gains without her consent is problematic.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the husband acted unethically and likely illegally by using his wife's inheritance without her knowledge. The trust between spouses is crucial, and such a decision without her input is a serious breach. The answer should be A, yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
