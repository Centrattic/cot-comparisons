We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The husband used 40% of his wife's inheritance to buy a new property without her knowledge. He had legal authority to handle her mother's affairs, but does that extend to making such a big financial decision? The wife didn't want to deal with financial stuff while grieving, so he took the initiative. But inheritance is typically considered separate property unless it's commingled. He put part of it into their joint portfolio, which might mix her inheritance with their shared funds. Even if he had permission to handle the affairs, spending a significant portion on something like a house without her input seems like a big step. The main issue is whether he had the right to make such a substantial investment using her money without discussing it with her. Also, the fact that he's using it as an investment opportunity might not have considered her financial priorities. The wife might have had her own plans for the inheritance. So, even if the intentions were good, the action of spending her inheritance without her consent is a problem.\n"
