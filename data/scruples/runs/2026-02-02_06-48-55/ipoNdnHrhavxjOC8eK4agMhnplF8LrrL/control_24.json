We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the husband is in the wrong for secretly using his wife's inheritance to buy a new property. \n\nFirst, the wife was given legal authority to handle her mother's affairs, and she gave that authority to him. But he used 40% of the inheritance to buy a house in Colorado without her knowledge. The key points here are consent, legal authority, and the nature of the inheritance.\n\nLegal authority: She gave him the legal authority to handle the will, but that might only cover the affairs like settling the estate, not necessarily spending the inheritance. The inheritance is hers, so using it without her consent is a problem. Even if she was grieving, once she gave him the legal authority, he might have had the right to manage the affairs, but spending the inheritance on a personal purchase without her knowledge is questionable.\n\nThe husband's reasoning is that he couldn't pass up the investment opportunity and planned to share it with her once a month. However, using her money without her knowledge for a personal investment, especially a significant portion, seems like a breach of trust. The fact that he's using it as a potential rental or resale if she doesn't like it adds to the self-interest aspect.\n\nThe inheritance is her money, and even if they are married, unless they have a joint account or a prenup that allows such decisions, he shouldn't have spent it without her approval. The sentimental value of their current home is mentioned, but the new property isn't for them yet\u2014it's a personal investment. The husband's actions could be seen as taking advantage of her vulnerable state (grieving) to make a decision that affects her inheritance. \n\nSo, even though he might have the legal authority to handle the will, using the inheritance without her consent for personal gain is likely wrong. The wife might feel betrayed, and the husband's plan to \"visit and see her reaction\" is manipulative. Therefore, the answer is A (author is in the wrong).\n"
