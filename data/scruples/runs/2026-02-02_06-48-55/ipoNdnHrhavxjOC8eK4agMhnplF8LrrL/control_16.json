We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for secretly spending their wife's inheritance. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the couple has been married for over 20 years. They live in a condo with sentimental value. The husband wants to buy a new house in Colorado but his wife is more conservative. The wife inherited money from her mother and gave him legal authority to handle the affairs while she was grieving. He used 40% of the inheritance to buy the Colorado property and put the rest in their joint portfolio.\n\nNow, the key points here. The wife gave him legal authority to sort through her mother's affairs. So he had permission, but the question is whether using her inheritance without her knowledge crosses a line. Legal authority might cover handling the will and affairs, but using a large portion of the inheritance for a personal purchase without her consent could be an issue, especially since it's her money. Even if she was grieving and asked him to handle things, the decision to spend a significant portion on a new property without discussing it with her later might be considered a breach of trust. \n\nThe husband's reasoning is that he couldn't pass up the opportunity and planned to surprise her. However, in a marriage, major financial decisions typically require mutual agreement. Using inherited money without consulting her, even if she gave authority for handling the will, might not be appropriate. The money is hers, and the inheritance is her asset. The husband's actions might have been well-intentioned, but the lack of communication and transparency could be seen as selfish or disrespectful.\n\nAlso, the plan to use the property as a rental or sell it if she doesn't like the surprise introduces risk. The wife might have different financial priorities. The husband's assumption that this benefits both might not hold if she disagrees. The fact that he's now considering whether to tell her shows guilt, which suggests he might know he did something wrong.\n\nSo, even though he had legal authority to handle the will, spending a large portion of her inheritance without her input on a personal purchase is likely wrong. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
