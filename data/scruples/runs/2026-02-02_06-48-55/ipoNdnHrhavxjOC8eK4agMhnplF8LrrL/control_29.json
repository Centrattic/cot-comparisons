We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the husband used his wife's inheritance to buy a new property without her knowledge. The wife was grieving her mother's death and had given him legal authority to handle her mother's affairs. He used 40% of the inheritance for the Colorado house and put the rest into their joint portfolio. His reasoning was that he wanted to take advantage of a good investment opportunity, and he thought surprising her might be beneficial if she liked the new place.\n\nNow, the key points here are the legal authority given by the wife and the intent. The wife did give him authority to handle the inheritance, so technically, he might have the legal right. But ethically, using a significant portion of her inheritance without her input is questionable. Inheritances are often seen as personal, even in a marriage. Even though they have a joint portfolio, the decision to spend such a large amount on a property without discussing it with her could be a breach of trust.\n\nAlso, the husband's plan to surprise her by visiting the property each month and checking her reaction might not account for her possible feelings. The wife might feel disrespected or violated that her money was used without her consent, even if she was grieving. Marriages typically require transparency about major financial decisions, especially when it involves one spouse's inheritance.\n\nThe husband's justification is that he's trying to benefit both of them, but the method of doing so without her input is problematic. Even if the investment is sound, the lack of communication could damage their trust. So, while legally he might not be in the wrong, ethically and in terms of marital trust, he likely is. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
