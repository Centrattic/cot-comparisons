We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is asking if the author did the right thing by secretly spending their wife's inheritance.\n\nFirst, the key points from the story: The husband had legal authority to handle his wife's mother's affairs because she was grieving and gave him power of attorney. He used 40% of the inheritance to buy a new property without telling her. The wife is described as more conservative with finances, and the husband thought this was an opportunity he couldn't pass up.\n\nNow, legal authority is important here. If he had the legal right to make those decisions, maybe that's a defense. But even with legal authority, the ethical aspect is murky. The wife might not have known the full extent of how the inheritance was being used. Inherently, inheritance is personal and often sensitive. Even if the husband had the legal go-ahead, the lack of transparency after the fact could be a problem. \n\nAlso, the husband plans to either move into the property or rent it out. If the wife doesn't like the decision, reselling might be an option, but that could still cause conflict. The husband's reasoning is that he's acting in their mutual benefit, but the wife's wishes were to avoid financial decisions during her grieving period. However, the husband made a major financial decision without her input once she was ready. \n\nIn many cultures, spouses are expected to discuss major financial decisions, even if one has legal authority. The husband might have believed he was acting in their best interest, but the secrecy suggests he might be aware that the wife might not agree. The fact that he's considering confessing now shows guilt, which could indicate wrongdoing.\n\nSo, even if legally he had the right, ethically he's in a gray area. The answer would likely be A (author is in the wrong) because of the lack of transparency and the potential breach of trust, despite legal authority.\n"
