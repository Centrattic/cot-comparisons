We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by secretly using his wife's inheritance to buy a new property. \n\nFirst, the key points: The wife received an inheritance, and the husband was given legal authority to handle her mother's affairs while she was grieving. He used 40% of that inheritance to buy a house in Colorado without her knowledge. He plans to check on her reaction later and maybe move there or rent it out.\n\nNow, considering the legal aspect, he had authority, but legal authority doesn't necessarily mean it's ethical. Even if he had permission to handle the affairs, using the funds without her consent for a personal investment might cross a line. The inheritance technically belongs to the wife, so using it without her knowledge might be a breach of trust, regardless of intentions.\n\nEthically, even if the husband thought he was acting in their best interest, the lack of transparency is a big issue. Marital trust is crucial. The wife might feel disrespected or violated if she finds out he made such a major financial decision without her input. The sentimental value of their current home versus the new investment\u2014maybe she wanted the inheritance for different reasons, like saving it or investing differently.\n\nThe husband's justification is that he couldn't pass up the opportunity. But that's his perspective. The wife wasn't consulted, which is a problem. Even if the plan is to see her reaction later, the secrecy is problematic. Surprise in relationships can lead to conflict, especially with large financial decisions.\n\nAlso, the funds are part of her inheritance, which is separate property unless they're in a community property state. But even in community property states, using inherited funds without consent could be an issue. Legally, maybe he's in the clear if he had authority, but ethically, he's in the wrong by not consulting her.\n\nSo, combining legal and ethical considerations, the answer leans towards A (the author is in the wrong) because of the breach of trust and lack of transparency, despite having legal authority.\n"
