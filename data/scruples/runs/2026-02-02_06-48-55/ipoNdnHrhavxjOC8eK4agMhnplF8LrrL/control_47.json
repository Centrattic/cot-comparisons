We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe person is married for 20 years, living in a condo with sentimental value. They used 40% of their wife's inheritance to buy a new property in Colorado without telling her. The wife was grieving her mother's death and had given him authority to handle the will, but he used that to make a big financial decision on his own. The wife is described as more conservative, and he mentions that he didn't consult her because she was dealing with grief and he didn't want to burden her. Now he's planning to visit the property and see her reaction, expecting it to benefit both of them, but he's worried he's being selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The wife gave him legal authority to handle her mother's affairs, which includes the inheritance. However, using a significant portion of her inheritance (40%) without her knowledge raises questions about the scope of that authority. Typically, handling affairs might involve distributing the inheritance according to the will, not making large purchases. But since he had legal authority, maybe he's within his rights, but that's not the only consideration.\n\nThen there's the ethical angle. Even if he had legal authority, the emotional aspect is important. The wife was grieving, which might have made her more vulnerable. He might have taken advantage of her emotional state to make a decision that's a big financial commitment. The fact that he didn't discuss it with her could be seen as a breach of trust, especially since they've been married for a long time. Marriages typically involve joint decision-making for major purchases, even if one partner is more conservative.\n\nHe also mentions that the new property is in Colorado, which implies a move, potentially disrupting their current life. The wife might not be on board with this change, and by not discussing it, he's not respecting her autonomy in financial decisions. Even if he thinks it's for the best, making such a large decision unilaterally could be seen as selfish, especially when the money isn't jointly theirs\u2014it's her inheritance.\n\nThe fact that he's planning to surprise her by visiting the property and seeing her reaction suggests he's aware there's a risk she's not okay with it. That hesitation might indicate he's in the wrong. Also, the potential for conflict if she doesn't like the decision could lead to bigger issues in their marriage.\n\nIn summary, while he might have had legal authority, the ethical issues around using her inheritance without her consent, especially during a vulnerable time, and not involving her in a major life decision seems problematic. The right approach would have been to discuss the opportunity with her once she was emotionally ready, even if it delayed the purchase. So, the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
