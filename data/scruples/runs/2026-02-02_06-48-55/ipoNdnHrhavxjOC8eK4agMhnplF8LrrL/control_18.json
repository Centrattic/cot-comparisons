We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the husband is wrong for secretly using his wife's inheritance to buy a new property. \n\nFirst, the key points: The wife gave him legal authority to handle her mother's affairs while she was grieving. He used 40% of the inheritance to buy a house in Colorado and put the rest into their joint portfolio. He didn't tell her, thinking she didn't want to deal with it during her grief. His plan is to check her reaction later.\n\nNow, considering legal aspects, he had authority, but the inheritance is her money. Even with legal power of attorney, there's a question about transparency and consent. Financial decisions of this magnitude typically require mutual agreement in a marriage, especially when using someone else's funds. The husband acted without discussing it, which could be seen as a breach of trust. \n\nEthically, even if he had the legal right, the secrecy is a big issue. The wife might feel betrayed if she hadn't agreed to the use of her inheritance. The husband's justification is that she didn't want to deal with financial matters while grieving, but that's his interpretation of her wishes. He should have at least kept her informed, even if he made the decision. \n\nAlso, the potential for future conflict is high. If the wife discovers this, she might feel her autonomy over her inheritance was violated. Even if the investment is good, the lack of communication is problematic. \n\nSo, while he might have had legal authority, the ethical and relational aspects suggest he's in the wrong. The answer is A.\n"
