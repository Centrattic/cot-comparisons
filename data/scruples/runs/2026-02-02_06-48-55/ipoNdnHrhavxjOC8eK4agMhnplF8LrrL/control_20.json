We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for secretly spending his wife's inheritance. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The husband used 40% of his wife's inheritance to buy a new property in Colorado without her knowing. The wife was grieving, and he had legal authority to handle her mother's affairs. But he didn't consult her about the purchase.\n\nHmm, legal authority doesn't necessarily mean consent for personal use. Even if he had the legal power, using the inheritance for his own investment might not be right. Inheritances are typically considered separate property, especially if it's given directly to the wife. So, unless they have a specific agreement or joint ownership, using that money without her permission could be problematic.\n\nThe husband says he did it because she didn't want to deal with financial issues while grieving. But that's not an excuse to make such a large financial decision without her input. Trust is important in a marriage, and hiding a $650k purchase is a big deal. Even if he plans to involve her later, the secrecy is an issue. Financial decisions, especially major ones involving significant assets, should be mutual. \n\nAlso, the husband's reasoning about the condo having sentimental value doesn't directly relate to using the inheritance. The fact that he might use the new property as a rental or sell it shows that it's a personal investment, not a shared family expense. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the husband acted without transparency, used his wife's money for his own goals, and didn't consider her financial autonomy. That makes me think he's in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
