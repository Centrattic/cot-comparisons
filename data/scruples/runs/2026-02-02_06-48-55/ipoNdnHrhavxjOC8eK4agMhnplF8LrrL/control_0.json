We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who secretly spent his wife's inheritance is in the wrong. The key points here are about consent and trust in a marriage.\n\nFirst, the husband had legal authority to handle his wife's affairs after her mother's death. He used 40% of the inheritance to buy a new property in Colorado and put the rest into their joint portfolio. The wife was grieving and wanted to avoid financial issues at that time.\n\nSo, the husband acted under her given authority. But the question is about whether he was wrong to do so without her knowledge. Even though she gave him the authority, using a significant portion of her inheritance without consulting her later might be an issue. Inheritances are usually considered separate property, but since they're married, there might be complexities in how that's handled.\n\nThe husband's reasoning is that he saw a financial opportunity and wanted to invest for their future. However, making such a big decision without discussing it with his wife could be seen as violating trust. Even if the wife gave him authority, there's a difference between handling her affairs (like paying bills or settling the estate) and making a large investment that affects their future together.\n\nAlso, the husband plans to surprise her and see her reaction. That approach seems risky because it depends on her being okay with the decision. If she's upset, it could cause major conflict. Trust is a big part of a marriage, and keeping such a significant decision a secret might erode that trust.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband might argue that he acted in their best interest financially and that he had the authority. But the authority she gave was likely for managing the estate, not making personal investments. The line between managing her affairs and using the money for a joint investment could be blurry here.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, even if you have authority to manage someone else's money, you can't make decisions that don't benefit them or go against their interests. The husband's decision to spend the inheritance on a new property might be seen as a misuse if it wasn't in her best interest at the time. Plus, inheritances are often protected from marital debts unless they're commingled, so using part of it for a joint investment could have legal implications.\n\nThe main issue is the lack of communication and consent. Even if the husband had the legal authority, the emotional and ethical aspect of making such a big decision without discussing it with his wife is questionable. The wife might feel betrayed, especially since the money was her inheritance and a major life event (her mother's death) was involved.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the husband is probably in the wrong for not being transparent and respecting his wife's autonomy over her inheritance. Even if his intentions were good, the method of acting without her knowledge is problematic.\n"
