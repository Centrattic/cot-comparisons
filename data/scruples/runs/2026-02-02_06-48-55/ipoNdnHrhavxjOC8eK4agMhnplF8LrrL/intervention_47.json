We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for secretly spending their wife's inheritance. The person wrote an AITA post where they explain that they used 40% of the inheritance to buy a new property in Colorado without their wife's knowledge. The wife was grieving her mother's death and gave them legal authority to handle the affairs. The husband claims they did this because the wife didn't want to deal with financial issues during that time, and he wanted to take advantage of a real estate opportunity.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The inheritance is the wife's, as her mother passed away and she's the only child. The husband had legal authority to manage the affairs, which might mean he was the executor or had power of attorney. However, using 40% of the inheritance to buy a property without her consent could be problematic. Even if she gave him authority, the inheritance is her personal asset, so he might not have the right to spend it freely. Also, the husband's intention to use the property as a potential rental or resale if the wife doesn't like the move suggests he didn't consider her wishes beyond just moving in.\n\nThe wife's grieving process and not wanting to deal with financial issues could be a reason she gave him authority, but that doesn't mean he can make such a significant decision without her input. There's a lack of transparency here. Even if he had her permission to handle the affairs, using a substantial portion of the inheritance for a personal investment without her knowledge is a breach of trust. The husband's plan to \"visit it once a month and see how she feels\" after the fact shows he didn't communicate his intentions upfront, which is a major issue in a marriage.\n\nMarriage usually involves mutual financial decisions, especially regarding large sums of money. The fact that he's considering using it as a rental or reselling implies he might benefit more from this decision than his wife. The inheritance is her money, so he shouldn't have made such a large financial commitment without her consent. Even if the authority was given, that might not cover using her money for his own investment purposes without her approval. The husband's actions seem self-serving, and the secrecy is a key factor here. The wife might have different priorities, especially since the inheritance is a significant emotional and financial asset for her. \n\nAdditionally, the husband's justification that he wanted to take advantage of the market opportunity doesn't outweigh the need for transparency and consent in a marriage. The fact that he's planning to approach her after the fact to see her reaction is manipulative. He should have had an open discussion before making the purchase. The sentiment about the condo having sentimental value for their child also shows that the husband values family history, yet he didn't consider his wife's feelings about her inheritance. \n\nIn conclusion, the husband acted without his wife's knowledge, used her money for a personal investment, and didn't communicate his intentions. These actions breach marital trust and financial responsibility. So, the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
