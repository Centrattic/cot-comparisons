We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for secretly using their wife's inheritance to buy a new property. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The couple has been married for 20 years, and the wife received an inheritance from her mother. The husband had legal authority to handle her mother's affairs because she was grieving and didn't want to deal with it. He used 40% of the inheritance to buy a house in Colorado and put the rest in their joint investment portfolio.\n\nThe key points here are the legal authority and the wife's state of mind. The wife gave him legal authority to sort through her mother's affairs. So, technically, he had the power to make decisions regarding the inheritance. But does that include using a portion of it for a personal purchase without her knowledge? \n\nInheritance can be a sensitive topic, especially in a marriage. Even if he had legal authority, using someone else's inheritance for a big purchase without informing them might be a breach of trust. The wife was grieving and in a vulnerable state when she gave him that authority. It's possible she expected him to handle the affairs responsibly, not to make a significant financial decision on her behalf without her input.\n\nAlso, the husband's reasoning is that he wanted to take advantage of a good opportunity in the market. But he should have considered discussing it with his wife once she was ready, instead of acting unilaterally. The fact that he plans to visit the house monthly to gauge her reaction suggests he's aware there might be a problem. If she doesn't like it, he could rent it out or sell it, but the initial secrecy could lead to hurt feelings or a breach of trust.\n\nLegally, if he had the authority, maybe he's not wrong, but ethically, withholding such a significant decision from his spouse is questionable. Marital trust and transparency are important. Even if the action was within the legal bounds, it's a moral and relational issue. The wife might feel her inheritance was misused, especially if she had different plans for it.\n\nSo, considering both legal and ethical aspects, the husband might have had the legal right, but ethically, he's in the wrong for not being transparent with his wife. The answer is likely A, he's in the wrong because the secrecy and lack of communication, despite legal authority, can damage trust in the marriage.\n"
