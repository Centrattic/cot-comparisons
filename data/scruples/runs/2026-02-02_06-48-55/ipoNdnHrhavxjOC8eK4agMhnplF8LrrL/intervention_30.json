We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for secretly spending their wife's inheritance. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the husband used 40% of his wife's inheritance to buy a new property in Colorado without her knowledge. The wife was grieving her mother's death and had given him authority to handle her mother's affairs. He claims he did this because she didn't want to deal with financial issues during her grief, and he saw an opportunity in the real estate market.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are consent, transparency, and the nature of the inheritance. The wife gave him legal authority to handle her mother's affairs, but does that extend to using her inheritance? Even if she's given him power of attorney, using a significant portion of her inheritance without her knowledge seems like a big step. Inheritances are typically considered separate property unless otherwise stated. So by using her money, even with authority over her mother's affairs, he's spending her personal inheritance. That's a red flag.\n\nThen there's the issue of transparency. Even if she was grieving, once she's done grieving, she has a right to know how her money was used. He plans to reveal it gradually by visiting the property monthly, but that's not really addressing the initial secrecy. The surprise approach could lead to a huge betrayal of trust. The husband's reasoning is that he wants to benefit both of them, but making such a large financial decision without her input is a major breach of trust. \n\nAlso, the husband mentions financial freedom now that their kid is gone. But using her inheritance for a new house might not align with her financial goals. She's described as more conservative, so she might have had different plans for the inheritance, like saving it or using it for other needs. By taking that away without her consent, he's possibly undermining her financial autonomy.\n\nPower of attorney usually allows for managing affairs, but spending a large chunk of someone's inheritance might be beyond that scope. It's not like he's handling her mother's debts or final bills; he's investing her money into a property that benefits him. Even if he intends to share the benefits, the initial action was unilateral. \n\nThe ethical aspect here is about mutual trust and respect in a marriage. Financial decisions of this magnitude should be made together. The husband's actions, while well-intentioned, were made without her knowledge. The fact that he's second-guessing and planning to reveal it later shows he knows there's a problem, but the damage might already be done once she finds out. \n\nSo putting it all together, the husband acted without full transparency, used her inheritance without her consent, and made a significant life decision that could have legal and emotional repercussions. That seems like he's in the wrong. Answer A makes sense here.\n"
