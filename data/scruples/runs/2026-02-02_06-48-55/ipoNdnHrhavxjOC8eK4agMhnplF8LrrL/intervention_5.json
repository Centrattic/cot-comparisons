We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the person (the husband) is in the wrong for secretly using his wife's inheritance. Here's what I know:\n\nFirst, the wife inherited money from her mother's will. The husband was given legal authority to handle her mother's affairs while she was grieving. He used 40% of the inheritance to buy a new property in Colorado without her knowledge and put the rest in their joint account. His reasoning is that he didn't want to burden her during her grieving period and saw a good financial opportunity.\n\nNow, considering the facts. Legal authority was given, but that doesn't necessarily mean he had the right to use the money how he wanted, especially a significant portion. The inheritance is her money, and even though he was handling it, major decisions like purchasing a property worth $650k should probably be discussed. Also, the wife is conservative with finances, so her mindset might differ. The husband's actions might be seen as overstepping, even if he had good intentions. The key points here are consent and transparency. He made a big financial decision without consulting her, which could lead to trust issues. Even if he planned to discuss it later, the secrecy might be problematic. So, the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong."
