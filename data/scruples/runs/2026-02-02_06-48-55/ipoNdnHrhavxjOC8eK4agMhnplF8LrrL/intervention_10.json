We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for secretly using their wife's inheritance to buy a new property. \n\nFirst, the key points from the scenario: The husband and wife have been married for 20 years. The wife received an inheritance from her late mother, and she gave him legal authority to handle the inheritance while she was grieving. He used about 40% of it to buy a house in Colorado without her knowledge, planning to use it as a rental or for themselves later.\n\nSo, the main issue here is the unauthorized use of funds that belong to his wife. Even though she gave him legal authority to manage the inheritance, using a portion of it without her consent for a personal investment might be problematic. The inheritance is her money, so he should have discussed it with her first. Even if he had her permission to handle the will, spending a significant portion on a house without her input could be seen as overstepping. Also, the fact that he's trying to justify it by saying he couldn't walk away from the opportunity doesn't necessarily absolve him of responsibility. Financial decisions that impact both partners should be mutual. The husband's plan to surprise her might backfire if she's unhappy with the use of her money. So yes, he's in the wrong because he acted unilaterally with funds that are her inheritance, even if he had the authority to manage them. The key here is consent and transparency in marital finances.\n"
