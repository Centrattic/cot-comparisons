We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by secretly spending his wife's inheritance. \n\nFirst, the key points from the story: The wife received an inheritance, and the husband was given legal authority to handle her mother's affairs while she was grieving. He used 40% of the inheritance to buy a new property in Colorado and put the rest into their joint portfolio. The husband didn't tell her about the purchase, fearing she might not want to deal with financial stuff during her grieving period. He plans to visit the property monthly and see how she feels about moving in, using it as a rental if she doesn't like the idea.\n\nNow, considering the ethical angle: Even though he had legal authority, the inheritance technically belongs to the wife. Using someone else's money without their consent, even with good intentions, can be seen as a breach of trust. Marriages require transparency and mutual agreement, especially when dealing with significant financial decisions. The husband might have thought he was acting in their best interest, but by not discussing the purchase with her first, he's withholding information that affects her assets. \n\nLegal authority doesn't necessarily equate to moral right, especially when it comes to personal finances. The wife might have different priorities or values regarding her inheritance. The husband's decision to act alone, despite her being the sole heir, could be viewed as overstepping. He also mentions feeling a \"sinking feeling\" that he's being selfish, which suggests he's aware there's something ethically off here. \n\nHowever, some might argue that he was respecting her wishes to avoid financial stress during her time of grief. But respecting her wishes doesn't justify using her money without her knowledge. The surprise element could lead to betrayal if she finds out later, which could harm their relationship more than if he had been honest from the start.\n\nIn summary, while the husband had legal authority, the ethical responsibility in a marriage usually involves transparency. Using her inheritance without her consent, even with the intention of benefiting both, is likely wrong. The answer would be A.\n"
