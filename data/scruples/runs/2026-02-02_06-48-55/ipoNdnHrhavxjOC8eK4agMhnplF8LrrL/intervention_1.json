We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for secretly using his wife's inheritance to buy a new property. \n\nFirst, the key points here are that the husband had legal authority to handle his wife's mother's affairs after her death. He used 40% of the inheritance to buy a house in Colorado and put the rest into their joint portfolio. The wife didn't know about this purchase until now. The husband's reasoning is that she was grieving and didn't want to deal with financial matters, so he took the initiative without telling her.\n\nNow, considering legal authority\u2014just because he had the legal right doesn't necessarily mean it's ethically right. In many places, joint ownership and significant financial decisions usually require mutual consent, even if one spouse has legal authority over certain matters. The inheritance might be considered the wife's personal asset, even if they're married. Using a substantial portion of it without her knowledge, especially for a personal investment, could be seen as overstepping.\n\nAlso, the husband's intention to surprise her with the purchase adds to the ethical issue. The fact that he's planning to visit the property monthly to gauge her reaction and then decide whether to move into it or rent it out shows a lack of transparency. Even if he had good intentions, withholding such a large financial decision from his spouse, especially after a significant life event like an inheritance, is problematic.\n\nThere's also the aspect of mutual trust and communication in a marriage. Financial decisions of this magnitude typically require open discussion. The husband's action might lead to a breach of trust, as he prioritized his own opportunity without considering his wife's feelings or financial autonomy. The wife might have different plans or values regarding the inheritance, and not consulting her respects her autonomy.\n\nWhile the husband might have acted with the belief that it's for the couple's benefit, the lack of communication and the surprise element are key factors here. Even if the investment turns out well, the method of handling it without her input is ethically questionable. So, I think the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
