We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he secretly used his wife's inheritance to buy a new property and invest some, without her knowledge. \n\nFirst, the inheritance is his wife's money. Even if she gave him legal authority to handle her mother's affairs, that might not necessarily mean she intended for him to spend her inheritance on a new house. Legal authority to sort through affairs doesn't equate to permission to spend the money. The fact that she was grieving and he took advantage of that situation adds another layer. She might not have been in a state to make a rational decision, but he was supposed to be handling her affairs, which could mean managing them responsibly, not using the funds for his own plans.\n\nHe mentions that he wanted to buy a new house because he's in a better position financially and their kid is gone. But using her inheritance without her consent is a big deal. Inheritance is often considered separate property, even in a marriage. So if they're in a community property state, there might be different rules, but in many places, inheritance is the individual's own. So using her money without her knowledge is a breach of trust. \n\nHe also says he's planning to tell her by visiting the place monthly and seeing her reaction. That's a bit sneaky. He should have been honest from the start. The fact that he's second-guessing and considering the possibility that she might not like it shows he knows it's risky. \n\nFinancial decisions of this magnitude, especially involving someone else's inheritance, should be made together. His decision to act unilaterally, even with the intent to benefit both, is problematic. The key points are consent, transparency, and trust. Without her knowledge and agreement, he's overstepping. So, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
