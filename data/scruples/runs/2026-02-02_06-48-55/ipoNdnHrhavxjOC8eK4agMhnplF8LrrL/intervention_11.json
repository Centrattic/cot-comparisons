We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for secretly spending his wife's inheritance. \n\nFirst, the key points: The wife received an inheritance, and the husband used about 40% of it to buy a new property in Colorado without her knowledge. He had legal authority to handle her mother's affairs because she was grieving and entrusted him with that. He decided to act on an opportunity he saw in the market.\n\nNow, considering the legal aspect: Since the wife gave him legal authority to manage her mother's affairs, he might have had the right to handle the inheritance. But the inheritance is hers, so even with power of attorney, using a significant portion without her consent could be problematic. The money is her inheritance, not joint property, so he might not have the right to spend it without her approval.\n\nEthically, even if there's some legal authority, transparency is important in a marriage. The husband didn't discuss a major financial decision with his wife. He made a big investment that affects their shared finances. The wife might feel betrayed if she finds out, especially since she's more conservative with money. Using her inheritance for a personal investment without her input seems like a breach of trust, regardless of the legal authority.\n\nThe husband's reasoning is that he wanted to take advantage of a market opportunity. But the wife wasn't consulted, and the inheritance is a significant amount. Even if he had the legal right, the ethical aspect is about mutual trust and communication in a marriage. Financial decisions that impact both partners should be made together.\n\nAlso, the husband mentions that they've been married 20 years and live in a condo with sentimental value. He's considering moving to the new property, which could disrupt their living situation. Without her agreement, this decision could cause more harm than good. The wife's conservative nature suggests she might not have agreed to such a risky or extravagant purchase.\n\nIn summary, even if there's some legal justification, the ethical failure is in not involving his wife in a major financial decision that uses her inheritance. The answer should be A\u2014yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
