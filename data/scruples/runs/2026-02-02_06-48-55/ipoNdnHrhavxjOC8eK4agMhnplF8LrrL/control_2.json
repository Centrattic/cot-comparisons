We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for secretly spending their wife's inheritance. \n\nFirst, the key points: The husband used 40% of the wife's inheritance to buy a new property in Colorado without her knowledge. He had legal authority to handle her mother's affairs, but he used that to make the purchase. The wife was grieving and didn't want to deal with financial matters at the time. The husband's reasoning is that he saw an investment opportunity and couldn't pass it up, planning to check in with her later.\n\nNow, considering legality: The husband had legal authority, so maybe from a legal standpoint, he's okay. But ethics and marriage dynamics are different. In a marriage, major financial decisions usually require mutual agreement. Even if he had the legal right, using her inheritance without her consent could be seen as a breach of trust. The inheritance belongs to the wife, so she might have different priorities for its use. The husband's action could be seen as overriding her wishes, especially since she was in a vulnerable state (grieving). \n\nAlso, the part where he says he plans to surprise her\u2014whether it's a good surprise or not\u2014shows a lack of transparency. Even if the outcome is positive, the method is problematic. Trust is crucial in a marriage, and this action might erode that trust. The husband might argue it's for both their benefit, but without her input, it's a big decision that affects their shared financial future.\n\nSo, even though he might not be legally wrong, ethically and in terms of marital trust, he's likely in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
