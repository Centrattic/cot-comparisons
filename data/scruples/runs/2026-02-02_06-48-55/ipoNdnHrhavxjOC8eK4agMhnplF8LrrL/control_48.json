We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for secretly using their wife's inheritance to buy a new property. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the key points from the scenario: The husband and wife have been married for 20 years, living in a condo for 10. The wife received a large inheritance from her mother's will, which the husband was given legal authority to handle while she was grieving. He used 40% of it to buy a house in Colorado and put the rest into their joint portfolio. The husband didn't tell her because he thought she didn't want to deal with financial matters during her grief. He plans to check her reaction later and consider moving in or using it as a rental.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's consider the legal and ethical aspects. The wife gave him legal authority to handle her mother's affairs, including the will. So legally, he might have the right to manage the inheritance since she appointed him. However, using 40% for his own investment (buying a house) without consulting her raises ethical concerns. Even if she gave him authority, using the funds in a way that affects their joint finances without her knowledge could be a problem. Inheritances are typically considered separate property in many jurisdictions, so he might not have the right to spend that portion without her consent. Also, the fact that he used her inheritance for a joint investment portfolio complicates things, as that's mixing her personal funds with their shared finances.\n\nEthically, transparency is important in a marriage. Even if he had the legal authority, keeping such a significant purchase a secret from his spouse for a long time could be seen as dishonest. The husband's reasoning is that he didn't want to burden her during her grieving, but that doesn't necessarily justify the secrecy. A spouse has a right to be informed about major financial decisions that affect their shared life, especially when using their partner's inheritance. The plan to \"visit and see her reaction\" seems like an afterthought and doesn't address the ethical breach of secrecy.\n\nMoreover, the husband's intention to use the property as a rental or resell if she objects shows a lack of consideration for her wishes. The wife might not agree with the investment strategy or the use of her inheritance. Even if the husband believes the decision benefits both of them, the lack of communication is a major issue. Trust is a cornerstone in marriages, and this secrecy could erode that trust.\n\nSome might argue that the husband acted in good faith, trying to make a sound financial decision. However, the means (secrecy) and the use of her inheritance without her input likely make him at fault. In many cases, even with authority to handle financial matters, a spouse's input is necessary for major decisions, especially when it's their personal inheritance. The husband might have overstepped by using the funds for his own purposes without discussing it with his wife first.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the husband is likely in the wrong because he used his wife's inheritance without her knowledge, even if he had legal authority, and did so in a way that disregards her autonomy and the importance of transparency in their relationship.\n"
