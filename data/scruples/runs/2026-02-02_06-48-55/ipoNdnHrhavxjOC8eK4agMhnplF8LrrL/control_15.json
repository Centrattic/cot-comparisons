We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband secretly spending his wife's inheritance. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the couple has been married for 20 years. They live in a condo with sentimental value. The husband wants to buy a new house, which is possible now that their kid is grown. The wife is more conservative with finances. She recently inherited money from her mother's will and gave him legal authority to handle the affairs during her grief. He used 40% of the inheritance to buy a property in Colorado and put the rest into their joint portfolio. He didn't tell her because she didn't want to deal with financial issues while grieving. Now, he's considering telling her and is unsure if he's in the wrong.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the use of the inheritance, the legal authority, and the secrecy. The wife gave him legal authority to handle the will, but did she authorize the spending of the inheritance on a personal investment? Even if she gave legal authority, the inheritance is her personal asset. Using a significant portion without her knowledge for a personal purchase might be an issue. The husband might argue that he had the authority, but legal authority doesn't necessarily mean consent for the specific use of funds. Also, the fact that he's using it for a new house they might move into suggests it's for mutual benefit, but the lack of transparency is a big factor.\n\nMarital trust is crucial. Even if the wife was grieving, the husband should have communicated this decision properly. The wife might feel her inheritance was misused, especially if she didn't agree to the terms. The husband's plan to visit the property monthly and see her reaction might be too late if there's already resentment. The surprise element could lead to conflict regardless of the outcome. The husband might think it's for their benefit, but without her consent, it's a breach of trust.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, inheritances are considered separate property unless pooled by the couple. So using her inheritance without her consent could be legally and ethically wrong. Even if she gave legal authority to handle the will, that's about managing the affairs, not necessarily spending the money. The husband might have overstepped by making a major financial decision without her input, especially for a personal investment.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the husband likely is in the wrong because he used his wife's inheritance without her explicit consent for a personal purchase, which is a breach of trust and financial responsibility in a marriage.\n"
