We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who spent his wife's inheritance without her knowledge is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the situation: The husband used 40% of his wife's inheritance to buy a property in Colorado. He had legal authority from his wife to handle her mother's affairs, but he didn't inform her about the investment. The key points here are the legal authority, the lack of communication, and the nature of the inheritance.\n\nLegal authority is important. The wife gave him power of attorney to handle the will, but using her inheritance money for a personal investment, even with her authority, might be crossing a line. The inheritance is her separate property, not joint. Even if he had the legal right to manage the assets, using a significant portion for a personal project (like a second home) without her consent might not be ethical.\n\nThen there's the aspect of trust. Marriages require transparency. Even if the husband thought she was grieving and didn't want to burden her, keeping such a major financial decision a secret could damage trust. The wife might feel her autonomy over her own inheritance was violated. The husband's plan to \"see how she feels\" by visiting monthly doesn't seem proactive; it's passive and risks her discovering it in a bad way.\n\nThe husband's reasoning about financial freedom and future plans for the kid are valid, but the method of using her inheritance without her input is questionable. He should have discussed the investment with her, even if she was grieving. Respecting her wishes during a sensitive time doesn't mean ignoring her long-term financial interests.\n\nAlso, the fact that the inheritance was from her mother adds another layer. It's her personal asset, and using it for a shared decision (like a new house) without her agreement could be seen as overstepping. Even if the investment is sound and beneficial, the lack of communication is the main issue here.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the husband acted without transparency, used her money for a decision that affects both of them, and didn't respect her autonomy over her inheritance. That makes him at fault.\n"
