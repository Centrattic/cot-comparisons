We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this Reddit post is in the wrong for secretly spending their wife's inheritance. The scenario is that the husband used 40% of her inheritance to buy a new property in Colorado without her knowledge, even though she had given him legal authority to handle her mother's affairs during her grieving period. The husband's reasoning is that he wanted to take advantage of a market opportunity and didn't want to burden her with financial decisions while she was grieving.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points here. The wife was grieving and gave her husband legal authority to handle the will. So there's some level of trust given. But the husband used part of the inheritance for a personal investment rather than just handling the affairs. Inheritance is typically considered the recipient's personal property, unless there's a legal agreement otherwise. Since the wife was the sole heir, that money is hers. Even if she gave him authority to manage the will, that doesn't necessarily mean he can use the funds for his own purposes unless there's a specific directive allowing that.\n\nAnother angle: the husband acted without consulting her further. Even if he was handling the affairs, using 40% of her inheritance to buy a property seems like a significant financial decision that should require her consent. The legal authority might cover things like settling the estate (paying debts, taxes, etc.), but using the funds for a personal investment could be outside the scope of that authority. \n\nThe husband's justification is that he couldn't walk away from the opportunity and wanted to make a good decision. But the wife might see this as a betrayal of trust. Financial decisions, especially involving someone else's inheritance, require transparency. The husband's plan to visit her and see her reaction later suggests he's aware of the potential issue but is choosing to act first and ask questions later. \n\nAlso, the property is in Colorado, which the husband has been eyeing. It's possible he saw this as a way to benefit both of them, but without her input, it's a unilateral decision. The wife might not want to move there, and using her inheritance without her knowledge could lead to resentment. \n\nLegally, depending on the jurisdiction, the husband might have overstepped his authority if the legal documents he was given didn't explicitly allow him to make such investments. Ethically, it's a breach of trust, as the wife likely expected him to handle her inheritance responsibly but not to make large personal financial decisions without her involvement.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the husband is likely in the wrong. He used his wife's money without her consent for a personal investment, even though she had given him authority to handle the will. That authority probably didn't extend to using the funds for his own property. The answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
