We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for secretly spending their wife's inheritance. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The husband and wife have been married for 20 years. They own a condo with sentimental value. The husband wanted to buy a new house in Colorado, but the wife is more conservative. The wife inherited money from her mother and gave him legal authority to handle her mother's affairs, which he used to buy the new property and invest the rest. He didn't tell her because she was grieving and didn't want to deal with financial issues.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's consider a few points. \n\n1. **Legal Authority vs. Ethical Responsibility**: The wife gave him legal authority to handle her mother's affairs. That might mean he had the power to make decisions about the inheritance, but does that extend to using the money for a new home? The will might specify how the inheritance should be used, but the post doesn't mention that. If he had the legal right, maybe he's not breaking the law. However, using the money without her knowledge could still be ethically questionable.\n\n2. **Trust and Communication in Marriage**: Marital property and joint finances usually require mutual consent. Even if he had legal authority, using a significant portion of her inheritance for a big purchase (like a $650k property) without her knowledge might breach trust. The wife might feel that her inheritance was misused, especially since it's a large portion (40%) and a big financial decision. \n\n3. **Intentions and Consequences**: The husband's intention was to buy a new home that could benefit both of them, potentially as a future home or rental. However, the fact that he didn't discuss this with his wife before acting could lead to resentment. The wife might feel disrespected or feel that her wishes (being conservative) were ignored. \n\n4. **Grieving Context**: The wife was grieving, which the husband used as a reason not to inform her. While she did instruct him not to involve her in financial matters during that time, that might have been a temporary measure. Using a large portion of the inheritance for a major purchase during her grief could be seen as taking advantage of her vulnerable state.\n\n5. **Joint Portfolio**: The rest of the inheritance was put into a joint investment portfolio. That part might be less controversial since it's a shared account. But using 40% for a personal investment (the new property) without her input is a big deal. Even if it's a joint investment, the initial decision to invest in a specific property without her knowledge is a problem.\n\n6. **Cultural and Legal Norms**: Depending on the jurisdiction, inheritance laws vary. If the inheritance is considered the wife's separate property, then the husband using it without her consent could be legally problematic, even if she gave him authority. Legal authority to handle affairs might not equate to permission to use the funds for a personal purchase. \n\nIn many places, inheritance is considered separate property, especially if the spouse is the sole heir. Even if the husband was handling the affairs, using the money for a joint purchase (a house) might require her consent, especially since it's a significant portion. The fact that he didn't consult her, despite the sentimental value of their current home, shows a lack of communication and mutual decision-making, which is crucial in a marriage.\n\nThe husband's plan to surprise her by visiting the property monthly and seeing her reaction is risky. It assumes she'll be okay with it, but the surprise factor and lack of transparency could lead to major conflict. Trust is a key component in a marriage, and this action could erode that trust.\n\nSo, putting it all together: Even if he had legal authority, the ethical aspect of using her inheritance without her knowledge, especially a large sum, is questionable. The breach of trust and lack of communication likely place the husband in the wrong. The answer is A.\n"
