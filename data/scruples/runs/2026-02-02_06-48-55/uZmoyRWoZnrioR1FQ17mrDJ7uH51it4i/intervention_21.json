G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The situation is that the author had planned a trip to Australia with friends, which starts two days before the wedding. The friend sent the invitations only a month in advance, which is pretty short notice. The author and friends can't cancel their trip because it's a big financial burden.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around attending weddings. Usually, you're expected to attend if you're a close friend, but there are exceptions. The author did invite the friend to the trip, so the friend was aware of the plans. The friend didn't send save-the-dates, which is part of proper wedding planning etiquette. Save-the-dates are typically sent several months in advance to help guests plan. By not sending them, the friend contributed to the conflict here.\n\nThe author and friends have already made financial commitments for the trip. Last-minute cancellations would cause a loss, which is a valid reason not to cancel. Also, the wedding is only getting about 40% attendance from the 50 invites, so maybe the author isn't the only one missing. The friend is upset, but the author isn't at fault because the friend didn't plan ahead. The key points are the lack of save-the-dates and the financial commitment. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
