      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about not attending a best friend's wedding due to a pre-planned trip to Australia. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The friend G didn't send save-the-dates and only sent invitations a month before the wedding. The author and three friends had planned a trip months ago, which G was invited to but apparently forgot. The author mentions that the trip starts two days before the wedding, so they can't attend. G is upset and expects them to cancel, but the group can't afford to lose the money.\n\nNow, I should consider the responsibilities of both sides. Save-the-dates are a common courtesy to give guests time to plan. G didn't send those, which is a significant oversight. The author's group had a planned trip, which is understandable if they've been saving for it. However, weddings are typically big events, and not attending could be hurtful, especially for a best friend. But G's poor planning might be the root issue here. \n\nThe author argues that the short notice made attending difficult. G invited 50 people but only 20 can make it because of the short notice, which suggests she might not have expected everyone to be able to come. The author isn't canceling the trip because it's a financial loss, which is a valid point. \n\nSo, who's at fault? The author isn't in the wrong because G didn't give proper notice. The trip was planned in advance, and G was aware of it. The author isn't obligated to drop everything, especially when the wedding was planned with insufficient time. However, the author could have tried to compromise if possible, but given the timing, it's not feasible. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. G's mistake in not sending save-the-dates and the short notice are on her. The author's decision to prioritize the pre-planned trip is understandable, especially with financial considerations.\n"
