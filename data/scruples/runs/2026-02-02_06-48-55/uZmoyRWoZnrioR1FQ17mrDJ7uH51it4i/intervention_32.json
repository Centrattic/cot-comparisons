      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not going to their best friend's wedding. The situation is that the author and three friends had planned a trip to Australia, which starts two days before the wedding. The friend, G, sent invitations only a month before the wedding and didn't send save-the-dates. The author argues that the short notice made it impossible to attend, plus the trip is a significant financial commitment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations of a best friend's wedding. Normally, you'd expect to be there, especially if you're close. But the friend didn't send out save-the-dates, which is a common practice. The author had informed G about the trip earlier, so maybe G should have considered that. However, the author is choosing to go on a planned trip over attending the wedding. \n\nThe author mentions that the trip is a financial burden and that they can't afford to cancel. That's a valid point, but is it a valid excuse in this context? The trip was planned before the wedding, and the author knew about the wedding date. If the wedding was a month away, maybe they could have adjusted the trip. Also, G is upset that they didn't just cancel, implying that the author is prioritizing the trip over their friendship.\n\nOn the other hand, G did give a month's notice, which might be considered short but not unheard of. However, as a best friend, one might expect a longer notice. The author's friends are also involved, so maybe the group dynamic is a factor. The author is trying to balance their commitments and finances.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, if you're a best friend, attending the wedding is typically expected unless there's a compelling reason. The author has a reason (financial and planned trip), but since the trip was planned after the wedding date (or before?), they might be at fault for not adjusting. Also, G was invited to the trip but forgot, which complicates things. Maybe the author should have tried to adjust their plans, even if it means some financial loss. \n\nBut given the short notice and the fact that the trip was already planned with other friends, the author might not be entirely at fault. It's a tough call. The author is not in the wrong if they explain their situation and still express support for G. However, if they're dismissing the wedding as unimportant, that's another issue. Overall, I think the author isn't in the wrong because they had a prior commitment and the short notice wasn't their fault. So the answer would be B.\n"
