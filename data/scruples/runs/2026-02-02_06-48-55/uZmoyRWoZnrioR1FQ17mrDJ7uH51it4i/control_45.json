G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about not attending their best friend's wedding because they had a planned trip to Australia. The friend didn't send save-the-dates and only sent the actual invitations a month before the wedding, which is when the trip was already planned. The author and their friends can't cancel the trip due to financial reasons, and the friend is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around weddings. Typically, save-the-dates are sent out several months in advance, like 6-8 months before the wedding. If the friend didn't send a save-the-date but only the actual invites a month ahead, that's a problem. The author and friends had a trip planned that they had already committed to and invited the friend to, so she should have been aware. \n\nThe author mentions that the friend is upset and acting like they should drop everything. Since the wedding notice was too short, and the trip was already planned, the author isn't at fault here. The friend's responsibility was to communicate the date earlier. Also, the author isn't the only one who can't attend; others are also affected, which suggests it's a common issue. The financial aspect is a factor too\u2014they can't afford to cancel the trip. \n\nSo, the key points are: the friend didn't provide adequate notice, the trip was planned beforehand, the author's friends are also affected, and the author is not being inconsiderate by not canceling. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
