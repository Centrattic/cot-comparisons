G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The main points are:\n\n1. The wedding was planned with only a one-month notice. The friend didn't send save-the-dates, which is usually done way in advance.\n2. The author and three friends had already planned a trip to Australia, which starts two days before the wedding. They informed the friend about the trip, but she forgot or didn't consider it.\n3. The author mentions that the friend is upset and acting like they should cancel their trip. The trip is a significant financial commitment, and they can't afford to cancel.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the responsibilities of both parties. The friend, G, as the one hosting the wedding, should have given more notice. Save-the-dates are typically sent 6-8 months before, and invitations 2-3 months out. By only sending invitations a month in advance, G didn't give enough time for guests to adjust their plans, especially for international travel, which the author is doing. \n\nThe author had already made plans and informed G about the trip. If G was truly a close friend, she might have tried to avoid scheduling the wedding so close to their trip. The fact that G invited 50 people but only 20 can attend because of the short notice shows that the problem isn't just with the author's group\u2014it's a systemic issue with the planning.\n\nThe author's decision to keep their plans is understandable because they've already invested money and time. It's a significant commitment, and they can't just drop it. The friend's reaction seems unreasonable given her own planning fail. The author isn't at fault here because the problem started with the late invitations. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. The main issue was G's poor planning, not the author's decision to keep their trip.\n"
