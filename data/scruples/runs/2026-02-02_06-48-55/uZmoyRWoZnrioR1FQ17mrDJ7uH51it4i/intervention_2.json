      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The situation is that the friend sent invitations only a month before the wedding, but the author already had a planned trip to Australia with friends. The trip starts two days before the wedding, so they can't attend. The friend is upset and thinks they should drop their plans.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the friend's perspective. The author is best friends with G, so maybe they expected to be there. But G didn't send a save-the-date, just the actual invites a month out. That's pretty short notice, even for a wedding. Typically, save-the-dates are sent out 6-8 months in advance. So G might have been at fault for not giving enough notice. The author had already planned this trip with others, which they can't afford to cancel. That's a significant financial loss, which adds to the dilemma.\n\nNow, the author's perspective: They had a planned trip that was decided a few months ago, and they informed G about it. G might have forgotten or didn't realize the timing was conflicting. The author's friends are also in the same boat. The cost of canceling the trip is a huge hit for them. Also, the wedding is at the grandmother's ranch, which might be local, so maybe the author could have adjusted their travel plans, but the trip is already set with others.\n\nAnother point is that G invited 50 people but only 20 can make it because of the short notice. That suggests she might have overestimated the turnout. If the author is one of the 20, maybe the wedding isn't as impacted by their absence. On the other hand, being a best friend, they might have expected to be there.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, attending a best friend's wedding is usually important, but the short notice complicates things. If G didn't send a save-the-date, she's partially at fault for not giving enough time to adjust plans. The author had already made commitments and communicated them. The financial aspect is a big factor here. It's not like they chose the trip over the wedding; they had prior plans that couldn't be changed.\n\nBut some might argue that a wedding is a once-in-a-lifetime event for the best friend, and the author should have made it a priority. However, given the lack of save-the-date and the short notice, the author might have felt they had no choice. Also, the trip was planned before the wedding date was known? Wait, the author says the trip starts two days before the wedding. Did they know the wedding date when they planned the trip? If they invited G to the trip, maybe they thought the dates didn't conflict. However, the user didn't specify if the trip was planned before or after the wedding date was set. Wait, the problem states that the trip was decided a few months ago, and G sent the invites a month before. So if the trip was planned before the wedding, maybe the author had no way of knowing the exact date. But they did invite G to the trip, so maybe G mentioned the wedding date then? But the user says G didn't send a save-the-date, so maybe the author didn't know about the wedding date until the invite. If that's the case, the author had no prior knowledge and planned the trip without conflicting dates. Then, the wedding was scheduled in a way that conflicts with their trip. In that case, the author isn't at fault. \n\nSo considering all factors: short notice, financial constraints, prior commitments, and that the trip was planned before the wedding date was known (since the invite came a month before), it seems the author isn't in the wrong. G is upset because of her own oversight in not sending a save-the-date and not giving enough notice. The author can't just drop everything at short notice, especially with financial implications. Therefore, the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
