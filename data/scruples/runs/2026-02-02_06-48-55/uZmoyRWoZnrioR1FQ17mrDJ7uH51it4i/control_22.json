      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The situation is that the friend, G, didn't send a save-the-date and only sent the actual invitations a month before the wedding. The person had already planned a trip to Australia with three friends, which starts two days before the wedding, so they can't attend. They say G is upset and acting like they should drop everything.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's friend didn't send a save-the-date, which is usually a common courtesy to give guests time to plan. The invitations came only a month before the wedding, which is a short notice. The trip to Australia was planned a few months ago, and the friend knew about it because they were invited. The author and friends are not wealthy, so canceling the trip would be a big financial loss. Also, out of 50 invited, only 20 can attend because of the short notice.\n\nSo, the main issue here is the timing of the invitations. If the friend didn't send a save-the-date, that's her oversight. The author had already made commitments (the trip) that they were aware of. The friend is upset, but the author had a valid reason not to cancel. The financial aspect is a factor, but maybe more importantly, the friend's responsibility to inform early is in question. The fact that only 20 out of 50 are coming because of the short notice suggests that the timing was a problem. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often consider both parties' responsibilities. The author isn't in the wrong if they had no control over the invitation timing and made the trip with prior knowledge from the friend. The friend's anger might be misplaced if she didn't give proper notice. The answer would likely be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong) because the friend's poor planning led to the conflict, and the author had previously communicated their plans.\n"
