      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The situation says that the friend G didn't send save-the-dates and only sent the actual invitations a month before the wedding. The author and three friends had planned a trip to Australia, which starts two days before the wedding. They couldn't go, and G is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around weddings. Typically, save-the-dates are sent out several months in advance, and formal invitations follow a couple of months before. Here, G sent the invitations only a month before, which is pretty short notice. That's a red flag. If the author and friends were planning a trip, especially one that started two days before the wedding, they might not have had time to adjust. Plus, they mentioned that the trip is a big financial hit if they cancel, which adds to the dilemma.\n\nNow, the author's best friend is mad and acting like they should drop everything. But G knew about the trip and was invited. Maybe she didn't realize the timing conflict. However, the responsibility for sending out invitations in a timely manner is usually on the couple. If they didn't do that, it's not the guests' fault. \n\nAlso, the author points out that G invited 50 people but only 20 can make it. That suggests maybe G didn't plan well, and the short notice is causing issues. The author isn't being inconsiderate by not showing up if the event was poorly planned. The friends had already committed to the trip, which is a significant expense, so expecting them to cancel might be unreasonable.\n\nOn the other hand, a best friend's wedding is a big deal. But the problem here is G's planning. If the invitations were sent on time, the author could have adjusted their travel plans. Since they were given only a month's notice, it's not entirely the author's fault. The author isn't in the wrong because the responsibility for proper planning was on the bride and groom. So, the answer is probably B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
