G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The situation is that the friend didn't send out save-the-dates and sent the invitations only a month before the wedding. The author and three friends had already planned a trip to Australia that starts two days before the wedding. They couldn't cancel because it's a backpacking trip and they're not rich, so it would be a big financial loss. The friend is upset and expects them to drop everything.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around weddings. Typically, you send save-the-dates several months in advance, sometimes up to a year, depending on the event's location and other factors. Since the wedding is at the grandmother's ranch, maybe it's a bit more low-key, but the key issue is the short notice. The author's friend didn't send a save-the-date, so the author wasn't aware until last week. That's a problem because planning a trip is a significant commitment.\n\nThe author and friends had already made plans and invested money, which they can't afford to lose. The friend is inviting 50 people but only expects 20 to come, which might indicate that she's aware that not everyone can make it. However, she's upset specifically about the author's group. \n\nThe author's responsibility as a best friend might be higher, but the friend didn't communicate well. If the author had known about the wedding earlier, maybe they could have adjusted their plans. However, since the notice was only a month, it's understandable that they can't cancel the trip. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because the fault also lies with the friend for not giving proper notice. The author can't afford to cancel, and the trip was planned before the wedding details were known. The friend's reaction is unreasonable given the circumstances. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
