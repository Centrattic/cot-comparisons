      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding because they had a planned trip to Australia that conflicts with the wedding two days before. The friend didn't send a save-the-date and only sent invitations a month before the event.\n\nFirst, the author's reasoning: They had planned the trip with three friends, and the friend (G) knew about it. G didn't send a save-the-date, so the invitation came last minute. The trip is expensive, so cancelling would be a big financial loss. The author feels it's unreasonable to drop the trip given the short notice and the friend's oversight.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's best friend is upset that they didn't cancel the trip. The friend invited 50 people but only 20 can make it, suggesting maybe the author is being dismissive. However, the short notice from the bride is a factor here. Typically, save-the-dates are sent out months in advance to avoid such conflicts. By not sending one, the bride may have contributed to the problem.\n\nFinancial constraints are a real issue. If the trip is already booked and non-refundable, cancelling would mean losing money, which isn't fair on the author's part. Also, the author and friends made their plans known to the bride, so she should have considered that when planning her wedding. The fact that the wedding is at her grandmother's ranch might mean it's a smaller, more personal event, but that doesn't negate the author's existing commitments.\n\nBest friends might expect each other to prioritize, but when there's a conflict due to the bride's planning mistake and financial implications, it's not entirely the author's fault. The key points are the lack of early communication from the bride and the financial commitment the author is facing. So, the author is not in the wrong here.\n"
