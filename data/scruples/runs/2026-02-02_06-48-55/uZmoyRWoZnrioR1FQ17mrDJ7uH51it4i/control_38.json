G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The key points here are the timing of the invitations and the existing trip plans.\n\nFirst, the friend (G) didn't send save-the-dates and only sent invitations a month before the wedding. That's pretty short notice, especially for a trip that's already planned. The author and their friends had a trip to Australia booked that conflicts with the wedding. They mentioned that G knew about the trip because they invited her, but she forgot. \n\nNow, the author is being criticized for not canceling the trip. But given that the trip starts two days before the wedding, there's not much time to adjust. Also, the author mentions that the trip is a significant financial commitment, which adds to the difficulty of canceling. \n\nThe number of guests is another point. G invited 50 people, but only 20 can attend. That suggests that maybe she expected more people to come, but the short notice made it hard. The author's friends are prioritizing their existing plans, which they had to plan in advance. \n\nIs it fair for G to expect them to drop everything? Well, if the author had known about the wedding earlier, they might have adjusted their plans. But since the invitations came too late, it's understandable that they can't change their trip. The author isn't in the wrong here because they had prior commitments and the friend didn't give enough notice. So, the answer should be B.\n"
