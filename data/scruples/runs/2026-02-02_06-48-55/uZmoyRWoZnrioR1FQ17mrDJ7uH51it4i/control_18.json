G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The main points here are the timeline and the communication.\n\nFirst, the friend (G) didn't send out save-the-dates, only the actual invitations a month before the wedding. The author and their friends had already planned a trip to Australia, which starts two days before the wedding. They had invited G to the trip, but she forgot or didn't remember. Now, G is upset that they can't cancel their trip to attend the wedding.\n\nSo, the key factors are: G didn't give enough notice. A month's notice is pretty short for a wedding, especially if the guests need to make travel arrangements. The author and friends had already committed to an international trip, which is a significant commitment. They mentioned they aren't super rich, so the cost of canceling would be a big hit. Also, G is inviting 50 people but only expects 20 to come because of the short notice. That suggests she knew people would have plans, yet still didn't give more time.\n\nThe author isn't the one who organized the trip; they're part of a group. They tried to include G by inviting her, but she forgot. The author is now facing backlash for not dropping an already planned trip based on G's oversight. \n\nIn terms of friendship, there's an expectation to attend important events, but G's failure to communicate properly (no save-the-date) complicates things. The author isn't in the wrong for not canceling a trip when the wedding details were only shared so late. It's reasonable to prioritize a planned, significant trip, especially when the notice period was insufficient. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
