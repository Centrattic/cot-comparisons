G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is at fault for not attending their best friend's wedding. The key points here are the timing of the invitation, the pre-planned trip, and the friend's reaction.\n\nFirst, the friend (G) didn't send a save-the-date and only sent invitations a month before the wedding. That's pretty short notice, especially for a trip that was planned months in advance. The author and their friends had already committed to a trip to Australia, which starts two days before the wedding. They mentioned that G knew about the trip because they invited her, but she forgot. \n\nThe author argues that cancelling the trip would be a huge financial loss, and they're not wealthy. Also, G invited 50 people, but only 20 can attend because of the short notice. The friend is upset and acting like they should drop everything for her.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, G didn't give proper notice. Save-the-dates are typically sent out months in advance to allow guests to plan. By not sending one, she made it hard for people to adjust their schedules. The trip was planned before the wedding date was set, and the author's friends were aware of it. The author isn't being inconsiderate if they had no control over the invitation timing. Plus, the friend's reaction seems unreasonable given the short notice and the financial impact. \n\nI think the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong because the responsibility for the short notice lies with G. The trip was a pre-existing plan that couldn't be changed without significant loss, and the friend should have communicated the wedding plans earlier.\n"
