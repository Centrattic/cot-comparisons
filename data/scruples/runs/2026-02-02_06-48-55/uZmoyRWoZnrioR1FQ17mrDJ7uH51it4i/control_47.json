      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The situation is that the friend (G) didn't send save-the-dates and only sent invitations a month before the wedding. The author and their friends had already planned a trip to Australia that starts two days before the wedding. They invited G to the trip, but G might have forgotten. Now G is upset that they're not canceling the trip to attend the wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the timing. Save-the-dates are usually sent out months in advance to make sure guests can plan. G sent invitations only a month before, which is short notice. If the author had received a save-the-date earlier, they could have adjusted their plans. But since they didn't get it until last week, they had to make a decision quickly. The author's trip was already planned with other friends, and they mentioned that they're not wealthy, so canceling would mean a significant financial loss. \n\nAlso, the author points out that G invited 50 people but only 20 can attend, which suggests that maybe G didn't plan the guest list or timeline well. The author isn't the only one not attending, but G is specifically upset with them. The friends were invited to the trip, so G was aware of their plans but didn't act in time. \n\nIs it wrong to prioritize an already planned trip? Well, weddings are important events, but the author had a prior commitment that was set before the wedding details were even known. The short notice from G complicates things. If someone has a best friend's wedding, they might feel it's important to attend, but if the notice was too short to change plans, maybe the author isn't at fault here. \n\nAnother angle: G's reaction might be disproportionate. The author tried to highlight that the notice was too late and that the trip is expensive to cancel. If G had sent a save-the-date, the author could have adjusted, but since she didn't, the problem is partly on G's side for poor planning. The author's friends also can't attend, so it's not just the author. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because the fault might lie more with G for not giving adequate notice and for expecting last-minute changes to an already booked trip. The author made their plans in good faith, and the financial impact is a real factor. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
