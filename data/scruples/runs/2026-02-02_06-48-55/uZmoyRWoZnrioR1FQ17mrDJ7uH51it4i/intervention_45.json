G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person in question didn't go to their best friend's wedding because they had an Australia trip planned. The friend didn't send save-the-dates and only invited people two weeks before the wedding. The person argues that cancelling the trip would be a huge financial loss. They also mention that only 20 out of 50 invited guests can make it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The friend didn't send out save-the-dates, which is a common practice to give guests enough time to plan. The author did invite the friend to the trip, but she forgot. The author might have expected that by inviting her to the trip, she'd remember the wedding date. However, the short notice was on the bride's side. \n\nFinancially, it's a big hit for the author to cancel the trip. If they had to pay for flights and accommodation, that's a significant expense. But weddings are usually considered important events, especially for close friends. However, the bride's poor planning (only giving one month's notice) complicates things. If the author had known about the wedding date earlier, they might have adjusted their plans.\n\nBut the author did mention they informed the friend about the trip. If the friend was their best friend, maybe there's an expectation of being there. However, the bride's responsibility is to give proper notice. The author might not be at fault because the bride didn't plan ahead. Plus, the trip was already planned with others, and it's a once-in-a-lifetime kind of thing. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend is upset because she expected them to cancel. But if she's only getting 20 out of 50 guests, maybe she's not handling the guest list well. The author's decision might be justified given the circumstances. So, considering the short notice and the financial impact, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
