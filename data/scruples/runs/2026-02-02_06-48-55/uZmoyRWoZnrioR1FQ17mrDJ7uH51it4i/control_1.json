      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The friend didn't send a save-the-date and only sent the actual invitations a month before the wedding. The author had already planned a trip to Australia with three friends, which starts two days before the wedding. They can't change the trip because they're not rich and it would be a huge loss. The friend is upset and wants them to cancel. The author is wondering if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around attending weddings. Usually, you're expected to be there, especially if you're a close friend. But there are exceptions. The author did mention that the friend knew about the trip and was invited. So maybe the friend should have sent the save-the-date earlier. If the wedding was a month away and the invite came last week, that's only a month's notice. If the author had known earlier, maybe they could have adjusted plans. But the author's trip was planned a few months ago, which seems reasonable. \n\nAlso, the author's friend invited 50 people, but only 20 can make it because of the short notice. That suggests maybe the friend didn't plan well. The author is trying to balance their commitment to the trip and their friendship. The friend's reaction is being called \"flipping her shit,\" which might indicate that she's overreacting. \n\nFinancial aspects are a big deal here. The author isn't rich, so canceling the trip would be a significant loss. That's a valid reason not to change plans. However, the author's decision might depend on how close they are. If it's a best friend's wedding, some might argue that you should prioritize it. But the short notice complicates things. If the author had the invite only a month before, they might not have had time to rearrange their travel plans. \n\nThe key points are: the friend didn't send a save-the-date, the author had prior commitments that were planned in advance, and the friend's short notice. Also, the author informed the friend about the trip, so the friend had the chance to adjust or send the invite earlier. The author isn't in a position to cancel due to financial reasons. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong) because the friend didn't plan adequately, the trip was already set, and the author couldn't afford to cancel. But some might argue that a best friend's wedding is important regardless. However, given the circumstances, the author's side seems more justified.\n"
