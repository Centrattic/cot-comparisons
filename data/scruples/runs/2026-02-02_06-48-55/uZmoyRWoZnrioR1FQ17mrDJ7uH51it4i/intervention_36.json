G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The key points here are the timeline of events and the communication issues.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that the friend, G, didn't send a save-the-date and only sent invitations a month before the wedding. That's pretty short notice, especially for international travel. Save-the-dates are typically sent months in advance, so G not doing that is a problem. \n\nThen, there's the fact that the author and friends had already planned a trip to Australia for two weeks, which starts two days before the wedding. They had invited G to the trip, so she was aware of their plans. The author also notes that G invited 50 people but only expects 20 to attend because of the short notice. This suggests that others might also have scheduling conflicts or couldn't get time off work, which is a common issue with short notice.\n\nThe author is being criticized by G for not canceling the trip. But considering that the trip was planned earlier and G didn't give proper notice, it's understandable why the author can't change their plans. Also, the financial aspect is mentioned; they aren't super rich, so canceling would be a huge loss. That adds another layer of difficulty in just dropping the trip.\n\nThe friend's reaction seems a bit over the top, expecting others to drop everything for her wedding, especially when she didn't plan properly. The author isn't the only one in the wrong here; G's lack of communication and poor planning contributed to the problem. The author had valid reasons and prior commitments, so they aren't necessarily at fault for sticking to their plans.\n"
