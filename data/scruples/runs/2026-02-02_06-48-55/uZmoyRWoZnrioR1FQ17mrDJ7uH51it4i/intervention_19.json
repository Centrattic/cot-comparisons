G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The situation is a bit complex. The author and their friends had planned a trip to Australia for two weeks, which starts two days before the wedding. The friend, G, didn't send a save-the-date, only the actual invites a month before the wedding. The author is saying that they can't cancel the trip because they aren't wealthy and it would be a huge loss.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations in friendships. Best friends usually have each other's backs, especially for major life events like weddings. However, the timing here is tight. The author had informed G about the trip months ago, so G was aware of the plans. If the wedding was planned later than usual, maybe the author didn't have time to adjust their schedule. But then again, a best friend's wedding is a big deal. \n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't get a save-the-date, which is a common practice in weddings to give guests time to make plans. If G only sent the actual invites a month before, that's a short notice and might be her fault. The author and friends are in a financial situation where canceling the trip is not feasible, so they can't just drop everything. \n\nThe user initially thought the author was in the wrong, but maybe they're considering both sides. The key points are: the author was aware of the wedding plans, but G didn't give enough notice. The author had existing plans communicated to G. The author can't afford to cancel. G is upset but maybe should have planned better.\n\nSo, who is more at fault? If G didn't send a save-the-date and the invites came late, that's on her. The author had prior commitments and couldn't adjust. However, the best friend's wedding might have higher priority. But the author's argument is valid too. Maybe it's not a clear-cut yes or no. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Considering that the author tried to inform G about their plans and the wedding was scheduled with a short notice, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. Also, the fact that only 20 out of 50 invitees can make it suggests that others couldn't come either, which might take some pressure off the author. So, the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
