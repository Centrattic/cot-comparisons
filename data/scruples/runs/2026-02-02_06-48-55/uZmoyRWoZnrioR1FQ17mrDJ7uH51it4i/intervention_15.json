G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The friend, G, didn't send out save-the-dates and only sent invitations a month before the wedding. The author and friends had already planned a trip to Australia, which starts two days before the wedding. They couldn't cancel the trip because it's expensive, and G is upset with them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author had a pre-existing commitment that they planned with friends. They mentioned that G knew about the trip because they invited her, so maybe G forgot or didn't realize the timing was conflicting. The author also points out that G only invited 50 people, and only 20 could attend because of the short notice. That might mean the wedding isn't as exclusive as G is making it seem.\n\nOn the other hand, weddings are significant events, and attending a best friend's wedding is often considered a priority. The fact that G didn't send save-the-dates is a red flag here. Save-the-dates are usually sent out several months in advance to help guests plan. By only giving a month's notice, G made it difficult for people to adjust their schedules. So maybe the blame isn't entirely on the author.\n\nThe author and friends are not wealthy, so canceling a trip would be a huge financial loss. That's a valid point. They had already made plans and might not be able to recoup the costs. Also, G's reaction seems excessive, given that she was aware of the trip and didn't account for the timing.\n\nI should also think about social norms. Typically, when you have a best friend, their wedding is expected to be a priority. However, if the friend didn't give proper notice, that's on them. The author isn't responsible for G's poor planning. The friends had to make a choice between a financial sacrifice and honoring their commitment. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It seems like they did their part by inviting G to the trip, and G didn't plan properly. The author has a valid reason not to cancel, especially since the timing was her fault. G's anger is misplaced because she didn't give enough notice. Therefore, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
