G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding because they have a planned trip to Australia.\n\nFirst, the key points: The friend G didn't send save-the-dates and sent invitations just a month before the wedding. The author and three friends had already planned a trip to Australia, which starts two days after the wedding. They tried to invite G to the trip, but she forgot about the wedding date. Now G is upset and wants them to cancel the trip.\n\nThe author argues that the trip is expensive and they can't afford to cancel. The wedding only invited 50 people, and only 20 can attend because of the short notice. G is acting like they should drop everything.\n\nSo, who's at fault here? Well, G didn't send a save-the-date, which is a standard practice. That's a big oversight on her part. The author had a trip planned that they couldn't just cancel, especially since it's a once-in-a-lifetime backpacking trip. Financial constraints are a real factor here. Also, the short notice from G made it impossible for people to adjust their plans. The author isn't the one who changed plans; G did by not communicating properly. The friend's reaction seems unreasonable because she knew about the trip and still sent the invite late. So, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
