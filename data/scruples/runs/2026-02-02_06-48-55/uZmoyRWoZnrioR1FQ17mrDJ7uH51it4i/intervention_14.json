(so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The setup is that the friend, G, didn't send save the dates and only sent invitations a month before the wedding. The author and friends had planned a trip to Australia that starts two days before the wedding and they can't attend. G is upset and thinks they should have canceled the trip.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's side: they had a planned trip that they've been saving for, and G knew about it. She only gave a month's notice and didn't send save the dates, which is part of the problem. The author and friends can't afford to cancel, so it's a financial hit. Also, G invited 50 people but only 20 can make it because of the short notice. \n\nG's side: she's upset because her best friends aren't there for her wedding. She might feel hurt that they prioritized a trip over her big day. But she did know about the trip and still sent the invites late. Maybe she thought they would adjust their plans. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Traditionally, attending a close friend's wedding is considered important. But there are mitigating factors here. The short notice and lack of save the dates mean G didn't give enough time to plan. The trip was planned months ago, and the author informed G about it. Financial constraints make canceling a huge loss. Also, only 20 out of 50 invited can attend, which suggests that many others are also unable to come, possibly for similar reasons. \n\nThe key points are: G's failure to plan ahead, the author's prior communication about the trip, and the financial impact. If the author communicated the plans beforehand and G still didn't adjust her timeline, maybe the blame isn't entirely on the author. However, in many cultures, weddings are expected to be attended by close friends unless there are extenuating circumstances. But in this case, the circumstances are the short notice and the prior commitment. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they communicated their plans, the wedding was planned with insufficient notice, and they have a valid reason (financial cost) to not cancel. G should have given more time and considered that the author had other commitments. So the answer is B (No).\n"
