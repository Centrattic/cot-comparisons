      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The situation is that the wedding was announced with only a month's notice, and the author had already planned a trip to Australia with three friends that starts two days before the wedding. The author mentions that the friend, G, knew about the trip but might have forgotten. G is upset and thinks they should cancel their trip.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around wedding invitations. Typically, save-the-dates are sent out several months in advance, especially for events that require travel. The fact that G didn't send a save-the-date and only sent the actual invitations a month before the wedding is a red flag. That's on her. The author and friends couldn't attend because the timing was too tight, and they had already planned and likely paid for this trip, which is a significant commitment, especially for people who aren't super rich. \n\nThen, the author's reasoning: they had planned the trip, it's a big financial loss, and G invited 50 people but only expects 20 to come. The author isn't in the wrong because they had prior commitments that they couldn't realistically change or cancel at such short notice. Weddings usually require guests to adjust their schedules, but in this case, the friend didn't provide enough notice. It's also mentioned that the friend is acting like the author should drop everything, which seems unreasonable. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that a best friend's wedding is important and should be prioritized. But the key points here are the lack of early communication from G and the author's legitimate, pre-arranged plans. The friend's responsibility to inform guests early is a crucial factor. Since she didn't do that, the fault lies more with her. The author isn't obligated to cancel their trip, especially with the financial implications. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They had the right to prioritize their already planned trip, especially given the short notice and the friend's oversight in sending save-the-dates.\n"
