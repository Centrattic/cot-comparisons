      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the letter is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The main points are that the friend didn't send a save-the-date, only sent the actual invitations a month before the wedding, and the writer had a planned trip to Australia that they can't cancel due to financial reasons. The writer's friend is upset and expects them to drop everything.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations in friendships. The writer mentions they've known about the trip for months and invited the friend, but the friend didn't send a save-the-date. That seems like a key point. Save-the-dates are usually sent several months in advance to help guests plan, so not sending one might mean the friend didn't plan ahead. The writer and friends had already committed to the Australia trip, which is a significant investment. Cancelling such a trip last minute would be financially devastating, which they can't afford.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend might feel hurt because weddings are seen as important events. But the writer did try to inform the friend about the trip. The friend's reaction seems a bit over the top, especially since she only gave a month's notice. The writer's decision to prioritize the trip they've planned and invested in makes sense. They aren't being inconsiderate; they had prior commitments that they can't realistically cancel.\n\nI should also consider cultural norms. In some places, attending a best friend's wedding is expected, but if the notice was insufficient and the trip was planned in advance, the writer isn't necessarily wrong. The friend might need to take responsibility for not sending out proper notices. The writer isn't being selfish; they're making a tough choice based on their circumstances. So, the answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
