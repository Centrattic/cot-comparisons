G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding due to a planned trip to Australia. The wedding was announced with only a month's notice, and the author had previously mentioned the trip. \n\nFirst, the friend didn't send a save-the-date, which is a common practice. That's a red flag because it shows poor planning. The author and friends had a trip planned that they had organized months in advance, which makes sense. They were upfront about the trip and even invited the friend to join, but she might have forgotten or not taken it seriously.\n\nThe friend is upset and thinks they should cancel their trip, but the trip is a significant expense and a long-planned event. The author mentions they aren't super rich, so financially, canceling would be a big hit. Also, the friend invited 50 people but only 20 can attend because of the short notice. That suggests she might have overestimated the turnout or didn't plan properly.\n\nThe author isn't being inconsiderate; they made the trip known beforehand. The friend's reaction seems excessive, expecting others to drop everything. The author's decision to go on the trip isn't selfish but a responsible choice given the circumstances. The friend's poor planning is the main issue here. So, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
