G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The key points here are the timeline of events and the reasons given for not attending.\n\nFirst, the friend G didn't send a save-the-date, only the actual invitations a month before the wedding. That's a very short notice for planning, especially for someone who's already committed to an international trip. The author and their friends had planned a trip to Australia long before the wedding, and they had even invited G to join. However, G either forgot about the trip or didn't realize the timing conflict.\n\nThe trip is financially significant for them, as they're not very wealthy. Cancelling would mean a big loss, which they can't afford. G is upset that they didn't cancel the trip to attend the wedding, but she only invited 50 people, and only 20 can make it because of the short notice.\n\nNow, considering social norms, it's generally expected to attend a best friend's wedding. However, the short notice here plays a big role. If G had sent a save-the-date, the author might have been able to adjust their plans. Since she didn't, it's hard to hold the author accountable. They had to make a choice between a last-minute wedding and a pre-planned trip they couldn't afford to cancel. \n\nAlso, the fact that G knew about the trip and didn't mention the wedding date until it was too late suggests that the problem lies more with her for not giving proper notice. The author isn't in the wrong for sticking to their commitments, especially when the friend didn't provide enough time to change plans. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
