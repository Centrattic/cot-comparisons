G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for not attending their best friend's wedding. The situation is that the friend sent invitations only a month in advance, and the author had already planned a trip to Australia with three friends, which starts two days before the wedding.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that they and three friends planned a trip a few months ago and invited the friend (G) to join. G didn't respond or remember, so she sent the invites last minute. The author is now caught between the trip and the wedding.\n\nThe author argues that the trip is a significant financial commitment and they can't afford to cancel. G is upset because she expected them to drop everything for her wedding. The author is defensive, pointing out that G only invited 50 people, and only 20 can make it due to the short notice.\n\nNow, considering the facts: G didn't send a save-the-date, which is a common courtesy. The author had already made plans and informed G about the trip. G's failure to communicate the wedding details earlier is a key point. The author isn't in the wrong for not canceling a pre-planned trip, especially when it's a significant expense. The responsibility lies with G for not providing adequate notice. The author's friends are also in the same boat, and the situation is more about G's mismanagement than the author's selfishness. So, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
