      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The situation is that the friend didn't send save-the-dates and just sent the actual invitations a month before the wedding. The person had planned a trip to Australia with friends that starts two days before the wedding, and they can't cancel because it's expensive. The friend is upset and thinks they should have dropped everything to attend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations. Best friends usually expect each other to be there for big events like weddings. But here, the friend didn't give proper notice. Save-the-dates are typically sent out months in advance, and actual invites are a few weeks before. The bride sent the invite just a week before the event, which is extremely short notice. That's a red flag. If the friend had followed standard etiquette, the person would have had time to adjust their plans.\n\nThe trip was planned a few months ago, and they did invite the friend, so maybe the friend was aware but still chose not to send a save-the-date. The person isn't in the wrong for planning something in advance, especially when the wedding notice was so late. Also, the cost is a factor; they can't just cancel and lose money. It's not feasible for them financially. The friend is inviting 50 people but only expects 20 to come, which might mean she's not managing expectations well either.\n\nOn the other hand, the person is a close friend, so there's an emotional aspect. But the bride messed up the timeline. She should have been more considerate in sending out timely invitations. The person isn't at fault here because the issue is more on the bride's part for poor planning. The trip was planned responsibly, and they can't just drop it. So the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
