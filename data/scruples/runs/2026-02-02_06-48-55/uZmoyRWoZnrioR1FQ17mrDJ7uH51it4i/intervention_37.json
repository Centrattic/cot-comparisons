(so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The situation is that the friend didn't send save-the-dates and only sent invitations a month before the wedding. The author had already planned a trip to Australia with friends, which starts two days before the wedding. The friend is upset they didn't cancel the trip to attend the wedding. The author's friends are not wealthy, so canceling would be a big financial hit. The friend invited 50 people, but only 20 can make it because of the short notice.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the friend's responsibility. Typically, save-the-dates are sent out several months in advance, and invitations usually follow a few weeks later. In this case, the friend didn't send a save-the-date, which might have been a mistake. The author mentions that the trip was planned months ago, and the friend knew about it when they invited her. So, the friend had the opportunity to plan accordingly but didn't provide enough notice.\n\nOn the other hand, weddings are considered important events, and the author is a best friend. The friend might feel hurt that her best friend didn't prioritize the wedding over the trip. However, the author did mention the trip in advance, and the friend didn't respond to any save-the-date or set a date earlier. The financial aspect is also a factor here; the trip is a significant investment, and canceling would be a loss they can't afford.\n\nI think the key points here are the responsibility of the friend to send save-the-dates in a timely manner and the author's prior communication about the trip. Since the friend didn't provide adequate notice, the author might not be at fault. However, the expectation of attending a best friend's wedding can be a cultural or personal norm that might make the author feel guilty. The author's friends' financial situation also adds context\u2014cancelling a trip at that point would be a big loss, so they have a valid reason not to go.\n\nConsidering all that, the answer is probably B (the author is not in the wrong). The friend's lack of a save-the-date and the short notice were her responsibilities. The author communicated their plans in advance, so they can't be blamed for not changing their plans when notified too late.\n"
