      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The situation is that the friend, G, didn't send a save-the-date, only the actual invitations a month before the wedding. The author and their friends had already planned a trip to Australia, which starts two days before the wedding. They can't cancel because it's a big financial hit. G is upset because they didn't cancel the trip. The author is asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The main issue is the timing of the wedding invite. Save-the-dates are usually sent out several months in advance so guests can plan, but G didn't send one. That's a common practice, so maybe that's part of the problem. The author and friends had a trip planned, which they mentioned to G before, but she still sent the invite too late. The author argues that they can't just cancel the trip because it's expensive, and only 20 out of 50 invited people can come because of the short notice. \n\nSo, the author's reasoning is that since the wedding was planned without a save-the-date, they couldn't adjust their plans. The trip was already made with knowledge from the friend, but she didn't act accordingly. The author also mentions that G is acting like they should drop everything, which the author feels is unreasonable. \n\nOn the other hand, G might feel that as a best friend, the author should have made an exception, even if it was last-minute. But the author is trying to balance their commitment to friends and their own plans. \n\nI think the key here is that the wedding planning was not done with proper lead time. The save-the-date is a standard practice, and not sending it made it impossible for the author to adjust their schedule. The trip was already planned, and they couldn't afford to cancel. So the author isn't in the wrong because the problem started with G's failure to send a save-the-date. The author isn't responsible for G's poor planning. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
