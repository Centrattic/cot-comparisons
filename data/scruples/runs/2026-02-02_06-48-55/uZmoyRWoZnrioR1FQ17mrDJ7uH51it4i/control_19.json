      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The best friend, G, didn't send save-the-dates and only sent invitations a month before the wedding. The group had planned a trip to Australia for two weeks, which starts two days before the wedding. They can't go, and G is upset. The author is wondering if they should have canceled the trip.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the timing of the invitations. Save-the-dates are usually sent months in advance to let guests know the date, so G didn't do that. Then the actual invitations came just a week before, which is really short notice. Weddings typically require a longer notice, maybe 6-8 weeks, so getting a month's notice is barely enough for last-minute arrangements. The author's trip to Australia started two days after the invitation, meaning they had maybe a week to respond. But since the trip was planned months ago, and they had invited G to it, she knew about the plans. It's possible G forgot or didn't prioritize sending save-the-date.\n\nThe group isn't wealthy, so canceling the trip would be a big financial hit. Sacrificing a planned trip for a wedding with such short notice is understandable, especially if the trip was important to them. Also, G invited 50 people but only 20 are coming because of the short notice. That suggests maybe the wedding wasn't a priority for many others either, so the author's group isn't alone in their situation. \n\nG is upset and acting like they should drop everything. That might be unfair because the author didn't know the wedding was scheduled until last week. If G had sent save-the-dates earlier, they could have adjusted their plans. The group did invite her to the trip, so it's not like they were secretive. They might have even expected G to remember and adjust the wedding date if necessary.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They made a commitment to the trip months in advance, and G didn't provide enough notice. The financial burden of canceling is significant, and G's reaction seems unreasonable. The answer should be B.\n"
