      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The situation is that the friend, G, didn't send a save-the-date and only sent the actual invitations a month before the wedding. The author and three friends had planned a trip to Australia, which starts two days before the wedding. They can't attend, and G is upset because she thinks they should have canceled the trip. The author is asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the elements of the story. Best friends usually have a close relationship, so expectations might be higher. However, the friend didn't send a save-the-date, which is a common practice. Typically, save-the-dates are sent several months in advance to allow guests to plan. Since the actual invitations were sent just a month before, that's a short notice, especially for someone planning an international trip.\n\nThe author mentions that they invited G to their trip, and she knew about the plans. So G had the chance to plan accordingly but didn't send the save-the-date. The author and friends are not wealthy, so canceling the trip would be a significant financial loss. Also, only 20 out of 50 invited guests can make it because of the short notice, which might indicate that attending wasn't feasible for many people.\n\nIn terms of social norms, while weddings are important, the responsibility also lies with the host to give adequate notice. If the author had known about the wedding date earlier, they might have adjusted their plans. But since the friend didn't provide the information in time, the author couldn't change their plans. Additionally, the author had made commitments to other friends for this trip, which implies shared responsibility in planning something that conflicts with the wedding.\n\nHowever, some might argue that a best friend's wedding is a priority, and the author should have made exceptions. But given the short notice and the financial implications, it's a tough call. The author isn't refusing to attend a wedding they knew about in time; they just didn't get the information early enough.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the author might not be in the wrong. The fault could lie more with the friend for not providing timely information. The answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
