G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The situation is that the friend didn't send save-the-dates and only sent invitations a month before the wedding. The author and their friends had already planned a trip to Australia that starts two days before the wedding, and they can't cancel because it's a big financial loss. The friend is upset and expects them to drop everything.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around weddings. Typically, save-the-dates are sent out several months in advance, maybe 6-8 months, and formal invitations a couple of months before. Here, the friend sent invitations just a month before, which is short notice. That's on the friend. Also, the author had already planned a trip and informed the friend about it. The friend might have forgotten or not considered the timing. \n\nThe author's argument is that they can't afford to cancel the trip. Financial commitment is a real issue, especially for people not in a wealthy position. The friend invited 50 people but only 20 can make it because of the short notice. That shows the friend might have known that many people might not be able to come, yet still expected the author to be there. \n\nThe key points here: the friend didn't give proper notice, the trip was planned before the wedding, and the author can't afford to cancel. The friend's reaction seems unreasonable given the circumstances. While it's understandable that the friend is upset, the fault isn't entirely on the author. The author isn't at fault here because the planning and financial aspects are valid reasons. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
