G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the friend (G) didn't send a save-the-date, just sent invitations a month before the wedding. The author and three friends had already planned a trip to Australia that starts two days before the wedding. They invited G to the trip, but maybe G forgot or didn't realize the timing conflict. Now, G is upset and wants them to cancel the trip.\n\nThe author argues that they can't afford to cancel the trip, and only 20 out of 50 invitees are coming. The main points here are the timing of the invitation, the prior commitment, and the financial aspect.\n\nIn terms of social norms, save-the-dates are usually sent 6-8 months in advance, and formal invitations 2-3 months before. G sent the invitations only a month out, which is short notice. The author had a planned trip that they've been saving for, so cancelling now would be a big financial hit. \n\nAlso, the number of attendees is low, which might indicate that the wedding isn't as big as G claims. The fact that G didn't send a save-the-date suggests she might not have planned properly. The author and friends had informed G about their trip, so maybe G had a chance to adjust the date but didn't.\n\nBest friends usually make an effort to attend each other's weddings, but if the wedding date was scheduled so late without a save-the-date, maybe G didn't plan well. The author is in a tough spot between their commitment and the friend's expectations. Given the short notice and the financial implications, it's understandable they can't cancel. So, it's more about G's poor planning and the author's right to keep their commitments.\n"
