G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's best friend, G, got married, but the author didn't attend. The main points are:\n\n1. The author and three friends had planned a trip to Australia that starts two days before the wedding. The trip was planned a few months in advance, and G was invited but might have forgotten about it.\n\n2. The wedding was only announced with a one-month notice, which is late. The author mentions that G didn't send out save-the-dates, so even if the author wanted to adjust their plans, there wasn't enough time. \n\n3. The author and friends can't afford to cancel the trip because it's a big financial loss. Also, G invited 50 people but only 20 can make it because of the short notice.\n\n4. G is upset and expects them to drop everything for her wedding, but the author feels it's unfair since they informed her about the trip earlier.\n\nSo, the key factors here are the timing of the invite, the financial commitment, and the expectations. The author had informed G about the trip in advance, but G didn't send out save-the-dates. The author can't afford to cancel, which is a valid reason. Also, G's reaction seems unreasonable given the short notice. Best friends might expect each other to attend weddings, but if the invite came too late and the trip was already planned and paid for, the author might not be in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer is B. The author isn't wrong because they gave prior notice about the trip, the wedding notice was too short, and they can't afford to cancel. G should have planned better.\n"
