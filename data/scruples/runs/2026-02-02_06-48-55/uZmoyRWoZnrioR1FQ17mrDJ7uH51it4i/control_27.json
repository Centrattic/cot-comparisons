G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The key points here are the timeline of the invitations, the planned trip, and the friend's reaction.\n\nFirst, the friend (G) didn't send a save-the-date, only the actual invitations a month before the wedding. The author and their friends had already planned a trip to Australia that starts two days before the wedding. They mention that G knew about the trip because they invited her, but she didn't inform them about the wedding date in time. \n\nThe author argues that the short notice made it impossible to attend, and they can't afford to cancel the trip. G is upset and expects them to drop everything, but the author feels it's unfair. The friend invited 50 people, but only 20 could make it with a one-month notice, which seems insufficient for international travel or other time-sensitive plans.\n\nFrom a typical AITA perspective, the main factors are the reasonableness of the expectations and the lack of proper planning. Since the save-the-date is usually sent months in advance to allow guests to plan, not doing so is a misstep. The author's friends had planned a trip that's already booked, which is a significant financial commitment. The author isn't in the wrong for not canceling a trip they couldn't foresee due to the friend's oversight. The friend's reaction seems unreasonable given her own lack of timely communication. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
