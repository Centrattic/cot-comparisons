G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The situation is that the friend didn't send a save-the-date and just sent the actual invites a month before the wedding. The author and their friends had already planned a trip to Australia that starts two days before the wedding. They can't cancel because it's a big financial hit. The friend is upset and expects them to drop everything.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around weddings. Typically, save-the-dates are sent out several months in advance, especially if the wedding is in a remote location or if guests might need to make travel arrangements. By not sending a save-the-date, the friend might have contributed to the short notice. The author and their friends had a trip planned months ago, which is understandable. They invited the friend to the trip, so she knew about it, but maybe forgot or didn't realize the timing conflict.\n\nThe key points here are the lack of save-the-date, the financial implications of canceling the trip, and the fact that the author is part of a small group who can't attend. The friend is upset, but she also gave only a month's notice. It's a bit of a two-way street. The author isn't being inconsiderate because they had prior commitments known to the friend. However, maybe there's some responsibility on the friend for not planning ahead.\n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole), the community usually looks at both sides. If the friend didn't plan properly and the author had a valid reason (financial and pre-planned trip), the author might not be in the wrong. Also, the fact that only 20 out of 50 invited guests can make it suggests that attendance is an issue, which the friend should have anticipated. So, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
