G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The main points are that the wedding was planned with only a month's notice, and the author had an Australia trip scheduled, which they had planned a few months ago. The friend didn't send a save-the-date, so the invites came last minute. The author argues that the trip was a big financial investment and couldn't be canceled. The friend is upset and expects them to drop everything.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the responsibilities of both sides. Best friends usually have a close relationship, so there's an expectation of being there for major events. However, the author had already committed to another plan, which they couldn't cancel without significant loss. The friend didn't send a save-the-date, which is a common practice to allow guests time to plan. That seems like a misstep on the friend's part. \n\nBut then, even with a month's notice, a wedding is a big event. Maybe the author should have checked the date earlier. Wait, the trip starts two days before the wedding. That's very tight. If they had known about the wedding date earlier, they might have adjusted their plans. However, the friend didn't send a save-the-date, so the author might not have realized the timing conflict until the last minute. \n\nFinancial considerations are important. The user mentions they're not super rich, so canceling the trip would be a huge loss. That's a valid concern. People often make long-term plans and can't just drop them without consequences. \n\nOn the other hand, a best friend's wedding is a once-in-a-lifetime event. The friend is upset because she invited many people and expects her close friends to be there. But she only gave a month's notice, which is short. Typically, save-the-dates are sent out months in advance. The fact that she didn't do that might be a contributing factor here. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because the friend didn't provide enough notice, and the trip was already planned. The author couldn't cancel without significant financial loss. The friend might have been negligent in not sending a save-the-date, which led to the conflict. The author's decision to prioritize the trip isn't unreasonable given the circumstances.\n"
