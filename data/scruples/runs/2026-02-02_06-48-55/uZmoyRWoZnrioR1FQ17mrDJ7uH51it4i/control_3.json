G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding because they had a planned trip to Australia. The friend didn't send a save-the-date and only sent invitations a month before, which is short notice. The trip was planned months ago, and the friend knew about it. The wedding is at the friend's grandmother's ranch, and the friend is upset that they didn't cancel the trip.\n\nFirst, the friend's part: Sending invitations only a month before and not a save-the-date is a huge oversight. Weddings usually require more notice, especially for guests who might need to travel. The author mentions that the trip was planned months in advance, and the friend was invited to it but didn't remember. That shows the friend might not have been proactive in coordinating dates.\n\nThe author's friends are not super rich, so canceling a trip that's already paid for would be a big financial hit. Plus, the friend is upset that they can't attend, but she invited 50 people, and only 20 can make it. That suggests some people might have similar conflicts.\n\nThe author isn't in the wrong because the trip was planned before the wedding, the friend didn't send a save-the-date, and the short notice made it impossible to adjust. The friend should have been more considerate with the timeline. The author is prioritizing a commitment they already made, which is reasonable. The friend's reaction seems over the top given her own missteps.\n"
