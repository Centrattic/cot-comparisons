      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The situation is that the author and three friends had planned a trip to Australia, which starts two days before the wedding. The friend, G, didn't send save-the-dates and only sent the invitations a month out. The author didn't cancel the trip because it's a big financial commitment and they can't afford to lose that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations in friendships. Best friends often have the expectation of being there for each other's major life events. However, the friend didn't send save-the-dates, which is a standard practice to give guests enough time to plan. If the author was invited to the trip, they might have thought G was aware of their plans. But the short notice complicates things. \n\nThe author is prioritizing a planned trip, which they've already committed to financially. On the other hand, a wedding is a significant event, but G only invited 50 people and only 20 can attend, which might mean she had limited planning. The fact that the author and friends had to decline because of the short notice could be seen as a problem on G's end, but maybe the author could have tried to adjust the trip schedule if possible. \n\nHowever, the author mentions that the trip is a huge financial loss if canceled. That's a valid point. They might not be able to afford the cancellation fees, especially since they're not super rich. The friend is upset, but the author might have done everything possible to be there if they had known earlier. \n\nIn terms of fault, it's a bit of a gray area. The friend's responsibility was to send save-the-dates to allow guests to plan. The author's responsibility was to check the dates and possibly communicate if there was a conflict. But since the friend didn't give enough notice, the author might not be entirely at fault. The trip was planned before the wedding was set, so the author had prior commitments. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because the short notice and lack of save-the-dates are on G's part. The financial aspect also plays a role here. The answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
