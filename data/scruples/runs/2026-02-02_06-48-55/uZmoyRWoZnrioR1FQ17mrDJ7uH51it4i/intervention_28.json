G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The main points are that the friend didn't send a save-the-date and gave only a month's notice. The author had a planned trip to Australia with other friends that starts two days before the wedding, so they can't attend. The friend is upset and thinks they should cancel the trip.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they invited the friend to the trip, which implies the friend knew about it beforehand. However, the friend didn't send a save-the-date, which is usually a courtesy to make sure guests can plan. The invitations were sent just a month before the wedding, which is short notice for a destination wedding, especially at a grandmother's ranch. The author and friends aren't wealthy, so canceling the Australia trip would be a big financial hit.\n\nThe friend is upset, but the author argues that the short notice made attending difficult. The author's friends are also involved, so this is a group decision. The friend invited 50 people but only 20 can make it because of the short notice, which adds to the author's point that it's not just them.\n\nIn terms of social norms, save-the-dates are typically sent a few months in advance, and invitations a couple of months later. The friend's failure to do this leaves the author in a tough spot. The author isn't the one who gave short notice; the friend did. So the responsibility might lie with the friend for not providing enough lead time. The author's decision to prioritize the planned trip, especially given the financial aspects, seems reasonable. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong because the friend failed to provide adequate notice and the trip was planned before the wedding details were known.\n"
