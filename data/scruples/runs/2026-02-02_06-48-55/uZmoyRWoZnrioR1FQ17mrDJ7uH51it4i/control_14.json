G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding.\n\nFirst, the friend (G) didn't send save-the-dates and only sent invitations a month before the wedding. The author and three friends had planned a trip to Australia, which starts two days before the wedding. They couldn't change plans because the trip is expensive and they're not wealthy. They had invited G to the trip, so she knew about it, but she still scheduled the wedding close to the trip date. Now G is upset that they can't attend.\n\nSo, the key points here: the author planned the trip before the wedding date was set. Since G didn't send a save-the-date, maybe she assumed people would adjust their plans. But the author had already committed to a trip they paid for. The friend's wedding has low attendance because of the short notice. The author isn't being inconsiderate; they tried to plan ahead. G might be at fault for not giving enough notice. The author isn't obligated to cancel a pre-planned trip, especially if it's a financial burden. So, the answer is probably B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
