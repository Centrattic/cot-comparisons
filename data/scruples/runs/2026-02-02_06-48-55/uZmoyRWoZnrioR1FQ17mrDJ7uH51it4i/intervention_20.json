G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the friend (G) didn't send a save-the-date, only the actual invitations a month before the wedding. The author had already planned a trip to Australia with friends that starts two days before the wedding. They mention that G knew about the trip because they invited her, but she might have forgotten. Now G is upset that they didn't cancel the trip to attend the wedding. The author argues that the trip is expensive, and only 20 out of 50 invited guests can make it due to the short notice.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the timing of the invitations and the prior commitment. Save-the-dates are typically sent months ahead to give guests time to plan. If G didn't send one, that's a problem on her end. The author had planned a trip that starts just two days before the wedding, so timing is tight. Also, the author mentions that they informed G about the trip, so G had the chance to plan accordingly but didn't.\n\nThe author and their friends aren't wealthy, so canceling the trip would cause financial loss. Plus, not many guests are making it because of the short notice. So, the author's decision might be justified because it's not their fault the wedding was planned with such little notice. G's anger might be misplaced here. The author isn't obligated to drop a pre-arranged, important trip just because the wedding was poorly timed. \n\nOn the other hand, best friends might expect attendance at a big event like a wedding. But considering the circumstances\u2014short notice, prior planning, and financial commitment\u2014it's a tough call. However, since the author had already communicated their plans and the wedding invitations were sent too late, the author isn't necessarily at fault. So I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
