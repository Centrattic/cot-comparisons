      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. Let me look at the details.\n\nFirst, the friend G didn't send save-the-dates and only sent invitations a month before the wedding. The author and three friends had already planned a trip to Australia that starts two days before the wedding. They mention that G knew about the trip but still sent the invites late. The author is arguing that they can't afford to cancel the trip and that G is upset because they didn't drop everything for her. The wedding is at her grandmother's ranch, which seems nice, but only 20 out of 50 invited people can make it due to the short notice.\n\nSo, the key points here are the timing of the invitations, the pre-planned trip, the financial aspect, and the friend's reaction. \n\nFirst, the friend's responsibility: If a wedding is being planned, save-the-dates are usually sent out well in advance, sometimes months before the invitations. G didn't do that, which is a common expectation. By not sending a save-the-date, she made it harder for guests to plan around other commitments. The author's trip to Australia was planned before the wedding, and since the invitation came so late, they couldn't adjust their plans.\n\nSecond, the friend's reaction. She's upset that the author and friends canceled the trip. But given the short notice and their prior commitment, which they informed her about, it's understandable they can't change their plans. The author mentions they aren't wealthy, so losing the trip would be a big financial loss. That adds weight to their position because they're sacrificing something significant.\n\nThird, the number of attendees. G invited 50 people but only 20 can make it. That suggests she should have been prepared for some people not being able to come, especially with such short notice. Her anger seems disproportionate if others are also unable to attend.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the author isn't in the wrong because they made their plans known to G and couldn't adjust due to the late notice. The responsibility for the short notice lies with G. However, maybe there's a nuance about the friendship. But given the circumstances, the author's decision to prioritize their trip makes sense. The answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
