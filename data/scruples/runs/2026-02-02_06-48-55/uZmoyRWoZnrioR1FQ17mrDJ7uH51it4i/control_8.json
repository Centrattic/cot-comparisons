G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The key points here are the timeline of the invitation and the pre-existing plans.\n\nFirst, the friend (G) didn't send a save-the-date, only the actual invitations a month before the wedding. The writer and three friends had already planned a trip to Australia, which starts two days before the wedding. They couldn't change their plans because they're not wealthy and the trip is significant. The friend is upset and thinks they should cancel the trip to attend the wedding.\n\nFrom what I know, save-the-dates are usually sent a year or so in advance, and formal invitations come later. If G didn't send a save-the-date and only sent the invitations a month before, she's at fault for not giving enough notice. The writer and friends had their trip planned, which makes sense to prioritize since they've already invested time and money into it. The friend inviting 50 people but expecting everyone to attend with such short notice is unreasonable, especially when only 20 can make it. The writer's reasoning for not attending, based on prior commitments and financial constraints, seems valid. So the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
