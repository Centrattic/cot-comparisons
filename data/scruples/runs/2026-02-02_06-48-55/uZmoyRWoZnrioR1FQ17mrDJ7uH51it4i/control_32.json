(so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The situation is that the friend, G, didn't send out save-the-dates and just sent invitations a month before the wedding. The author and their friends had already planned a trip to Australia that starts two days before the wedding, and they can't cancel because it's expensive. They invited G to the trip, but she forgot about it. The author is wondering if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations of attending a wedding. Usually, weddings are big events with save-the-dates sent out months in advance. G didn't send those, so the short notice is definitely on her. The author's friends couldn't cancel their trip because it's a financial burden, which is a valid point. Also, they only invited 50 people, and only 20 can make it, which suggests the wedding might be more intimate than expected. \n\nG is upset because the author and friends chose a trip over her wedding. But since the notice was so short and the trip was already planned, it's understandable that they can't change their plans. Best friends might expect each other to be there, but if the wedding was planned without proper notice, maybe the expectations are unrealistic. The author isn't in the wrong here because they tried to inform G about the trip and the situation isn't their fault. The financial aspect adds to the difficulty of canceling. So, the answer is B.\n"
