G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for not attending their best friend's wedding. The key points here are the timeline and communication.\n\nFirst, the friend didn't send a save-the-date, only the actual invitations a month before the wedding. That's a pretty short notice for most people, especially for something as important as a wedding. The author and their friends had already planned a trip to Australia, which they've been working on for a few months. They did invite the friend to the trip, so she knew about it in advance. The friend is upset they didn't cancel the trip to attend her wedding.\n\nNow, considering the notice period. A month before the wedding is short, but maybe not unheard of. However, the author had already committed to an expensive trip that started just two days before the wedding. Cancelling would mean a significant financial loss because they're not wealthy. The friend is expecting them to drop everything, which seems a bit unreasonable given the short notice. Also, the author points out that only 20 out of 50 invitees can attend, which might mean the friend isn't expecting everyone to come.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, they had prior commitments and were given short notice. The friend is the one who didn't send out save-the-dates, which is a standard practice. The author tried to inform the friend about the trip, so there's no surprise on their end. The friend's reaction of being angry and expecting cancellation seems harsh. The financial impact is a valid reason to keep the trip. So, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
