G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The situation is that the friend didn't send save-the-dates and only sent invites a month before the wedding. The author and friends had already planned a trip to Australia, which starts two days before the wedding. They can't cancel because it's a big financial loss. The friend is upset and thinks they should drop everything.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the timeline. Save-the-dates are usually sent way in advance, but the friend didn't send them. Then the actual invites came a month before, which is pretty short notice for a wedding. The author and friends had their trip planned months ago, and the friend knew about it. The author mentions that the friend invited 50 people but only 20 can make it due to the short notice. The friend is angry, expecting everyone to cancel their plans.\n\nSo, the key points here: the friend didn't give enough notice, the trip was planned well in advance and is costly to cancel, and the friend is acting entitled. The author's reasoning seems valid because they made the trip with other friends, which is a significant expense, and the friend's lack of planning contributed to the problem. The author isn't the only one at fault, but given the circumstances, they probably aren't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
