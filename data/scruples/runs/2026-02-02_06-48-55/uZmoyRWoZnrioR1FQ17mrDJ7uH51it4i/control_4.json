      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking if the person in the \"AITA\" (Am I The Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about not attending a best friend's wedding because they planned a trip to Australia that starts two days before the wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The friend G didn't send save-the-dates and only mailed invitations a month before the wedding. The author and their friends had already planned a trip to Australia, which they couldn't cancel due to financial constraints. The author is being criticized by G for not prioritizing the wedding over the trip.\n\nNow, considering the norms around weddings. Typically, save-the-dates are sent out several months in advance, sometimes up to six months or more. The fact that G didn't send one until a month before might be a red flag. Inviting people a month before might not be sufficient notice, especially for people who might need to make travel arrangements. The author mentions that G invited 50 people, but only 20 can attend because of the short notice. That suggests that the timing was an issue from G's side.\n\nThe author and friends had prior commitments (the Australia trip) that they had planned in advance. They had even invited G to join them, which G might have forgotten. The author is not the only one in this situation; the friends are also part of this group. Financial constraints are a real factor here; canceling a trip like that would be a significant loss, especially if the tickets or accommodations are non-refundable.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is a best friend, so there might be an expectation of attendance. However, given the short notice and the fact that the author had already made plans that G was aware of, the responsibility might lie with G for not planning properly. The author's explanation about the trip and the financial aspect seems valid. The fact that many others can't attend for the same reason (short notice) also implies that the issue isn't solely the author's.\n\nI have to consider cultural expectations as well. In some cultures, attending a close friend's wedding is expected, but if the planning was done poorly, the friend might share some responsibility. The author's stance is that they can't just drop everything, especially with financial implications. It's a balance between friendship and personal commitments.\n\nSo, putting it all together: G's failure to send a save-the-date and giving only a month's notice is a significant oversight. The author had prior commitments that G was aware of and couldn't be easily changed. The financial aspect is a legitimate concern. The majority of invitees can't attend, so the problem isn't just the author. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
