G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The situation is that the wedding was planned with only a one-month notice, and the author had already planned a trip to Australia with friends a few months prior. The friend knew about the trip but sent the invitation too late.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the timeline and the friend's awareness. The author and friends had planned the trip months in advance and invited the friend. The wedding was announced with a one-month notice, which is short. The author can't attend because of the scheduled trip, which is a significant financial commitment. \n\nNow, considering friendship dynamics. The author is a best friend, so one might expect more consideration. However, the friend is responsible for the short notice. If the wedding was a surprise or rushed, the friend might share some responsibility for not giving adequate time to adjust plans. \n\nFinancial aspect is important. The user mentions they aren't super rich, so cancelling the trip would be a big loss. It's not just about wanting to go; it's about the financial impact. \n\nAlso, the friend invited 50 people but only 20 can attend due to the short notice. This shows that others might have similar issues, which could mean the friend is being unreasonable in expecting everyone to drop their plans. \n\nThe author isn't being selfish here; they made plans in good faith. The friend's anger seems misplaced because she didn't communicate the wedding plans in time. Best friends usually have each other's backs, but in this case, the fault might lie with the friend for not managing the timeline better. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong. They acted responsibly by planning ahead and couldn't change their plans without significant loss. The friend is at fault for the short notice and not being flexible. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
