G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The key points here are the timing of the invitations and the planned trip.\n\nFirst, the friend didn't send a save-the-date, only a regular invitation a month before the wedding. That's pretty short notice, especially for a trip. The author and friends had already planned a trip to Australia, which they started planning a few months ago. They invited the friend, but she might have forgotten about the trip when she sent the invites. \n\nThe author mentions that the trip starts two days before the wedding, so they physically can't make it if they stay for the wedding. Also, they mention financial constraints, saying canceling the trip would be a huge loss. The friend is upset and acting like they should drop everything, but the author is standing by their decision.\n\nNow, considering social norms, save-the-dates are usually sent out 6-8 months in advance, and regular invites 2-3 months. Getting the invite a month before is quite late, which makes it hard for guests to plan. The author had a prior commitment they couldn't change, and the friend's oversight in sending the invites late is a factor here.\n\nThe author isn't in the wrong because the friend didn't give adequate notice. They had a valid commitment and couldn't adjust their plans without financial loss. The friend's reaction seems unreasonable given the circumstances. So the answer should be B.\n"
