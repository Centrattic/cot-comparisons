G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the friend, G, didn't send out save-the-dates and only sent the actual invitations a month before the wedding. The author and their friends had a planned trip to Australia, which starts two days before the wedding. They informed G about the trip, so she knew. Now, G is upset that they can't cancel the trip to attend.\n\nThe key points here are the timing of the invitation and the prior knowledge. Save-the-dates are usually sent months in advance to avoid scheduling conflicts. G didn't send those, which is a common practice. The author's friends had already planned a significant trip, which is a big financial commitment. They couldn't just cancel last minute because G didn't give enough notice.\n\nAlso, G invited 50 people but only expects 20 to come. It seems like the venue and planning might have been rushed. The author and friends are being blamed for not dropping their plans, but if G had sent a save-the-date earlier, there might have been time to adjust.\n\nThe author's position is that they're not in the wrong because the short notice and lack of save-the-date made it impossible to plan. G knew about the trip and still sent the invitations too late. The author isn't being selfish; they made the trip after informing G, so they have a valid reason. The answer should be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
