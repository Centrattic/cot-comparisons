G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA story) is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding due to a pre-planned trip to Australia.\n\nFirst, the friend (G) didn't send save-the-dates and only sent invitations a month before the wedding. The author and three friends had already planned a two-week trip to Australia, which starts two days before the wedding. They informed G about the trip, but she didn't account for that and sent the invites too late. Now, G is upset that they can't cancel their trip to attend. \n\nThe author's friends argue that they can't afford to cancel, as it's a significant financial loss. G invited 50 people but only 20 can attend because of the short notice. The author feels it's unfair for G to expect them to drop everything, especially since the notice was insufficient.\n\nSo, the key points are: G's poor planning (no save-the-dates, only a month's notice), the trip was already planned and others were involved, financial implications, and the fact that G's guest list isn't fully attending. \n\nThe user initially thought the author was in the wrong but wants to know others' opinions. \n\nIn terms of social etiquette, friends usually give save-the-dates for weddings, allowing guests to make plans. By not sending them, G didn't give her friends enough time to adjust their schedules. The author and friends made a commitment to travel, which was known to G. However, weddings are important events, so there's a cultural expectation to attend if possible. But the author's situation complicates it due to the short notice and financial issues.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because G didn't plan properly and the trip was already in place. The answer should be B.\n"
