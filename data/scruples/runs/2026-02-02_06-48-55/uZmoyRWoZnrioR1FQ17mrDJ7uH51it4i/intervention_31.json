G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's best friend, G, didn't send a save-the-date and only sent the actual invitations a month before the wedding. The author and three friends had planned a trip to Australia that starts two days before the wedding, and they can't reschedule. G is upset they aren't attending, but the author thinks it's a huge financial loss to cancel.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations around attending a wedding. Typically, close friends are expected to attend, but the author argues that the short notice (only a month) and the fact that G didn't send a save-the-date complicates things. The author also mentions that the trip was planned months ago and that they were invited to the trip, implying G was aware of the plans. \n\nOn the other hand, G might feel that as a best friend, the author should prioritize her wedding. But since the invitations came too late, maybe the author couldn't adjust their plans. The financial aspect is a big factor here, as canceling a trip to Australia would be expensive. \n\nI should check if the author is being unreasonable. Since the trip was planned in advance and the wedding notice was insufficient, the author might not be at fault. Also, G invited 50 people, but only 20 can attend, which might make the pressure less about the number of attendees. \n\nThe key points are the lack of save-the-date, the short notice, the prior planning of the trip, and the financial burden. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong here. Answer B makes sense.\n"
