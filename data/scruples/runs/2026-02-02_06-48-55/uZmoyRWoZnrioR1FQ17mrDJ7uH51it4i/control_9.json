      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author (the person in the AITA scenario) is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding.\n\nFirst, the key points from the scenario: The friend G didn't send save-the-dates and only sent invitations a month before the wedding. The author and three friends had planned a trip to Australia that starts two days before the wedding. They had invited G to the trip, but she might have forgotten about it. The author is considering canceling the trip but it's a big financial hit because they aren't super rich. G is upset and wants them to cancel the trip.\n\nSo, I need to evaluate if the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down.\n\n1. **Friend G's Responsibility**: Save-the-dates are usually sent several months in advance to give guests enough time to plan. If G didn't send one and only gave a month's notice, that's a problem. A month is usually too short for international travel or significant plans. So G made the mistake of not giving proper notice.\n\n2. **Author's Pre-existing Plans**: The trip was planned with other friends, and they had invited G. G might have forgotten about the trip when planning the wedding. The author's trip is already booked, and canceling would be costly. It's unfair to expect someone to cancel a trip they've already planned and notified their friend about, especially when the wedding notice was late.\n\n3. **Financial Aspects**: The author mentions they aren't wealthy, so the trip is a big commitment. The financial burden of canceling adds another layer of stress. It's reasonable for them to prioritize their investment in the trip, especially since G's oversight led to the conflict.\n\n4. **Expectation of Attendance**: G is acting like they should drop everything, but realistically, the author has every right to have prior commitments. Even if it's a best friend's wedding, the timing and notice were the root issues here. G should have planned better to accommodate close friends' schedules.\n\n5. **Other Guests**: It's noted that out of 50 invited, only 20 can make it. This shows that the short notice is causing widespread issues, not just for the author. This context supports the idea that G's planning was flawed, not the author's decision.\n\nPutting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. The primary fault lies with G for not providing adequate notice. The author had planned ahead and couldn't change their plans without significant loss. G's expectations are unreasonable given her own missteps. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
