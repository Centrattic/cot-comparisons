G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The scenario is that the author and three friends planned a trip to Australia, which starts two days before the wedding. The friend, G, sent the invitations only a month before the event, and didn't send save-the-dates. The author is now being criticized by G for not canceling the trip.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms of attending weddings. Typically, you RSVP based on the invitations and save-the-date notices given. The author's friend sent the invitations a month in advance, which is shorter than the standard save-the-date, which is usually 6-8 months before the wedding. The author had prior commitments that were planned months in advance, and G knew about the trip but didn't send a save-the-date. \n\nThe author mentions that the trip is a significant financial burden, and they can't afford to cancel. The friend is upset and acting like they should drop everything, which seems unreasonable. The author's reasoning is that the short notice made it impossible to adjust their plans, and they had a valid reason for not attending. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that a best friend's wedding is an important event and should be prioritized. However, in this case, the short notice from the bride could be a factor. If the author had received a save-the-date earlier, they might have adjusted their plans. The fact that the trip was planned with friends and involves significant expense adds to the justification. \n\nSo, the key points are the lack of save-the-date, the short notice, the prior planning of the trip, and the financial implications. The author isn't at fault because the responsibility also lies with the bride for not giving sufficient notice. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
