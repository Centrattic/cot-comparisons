      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author's best friend, G, didn't send save-the-dates and only sent invitations a month before the wedding. The author and three friends had planned a trip to Australia that starts two days before the wedding. They invited G to the trip, but she forgot about it or didn't consider it. Now, G is upset and expects them to cancel the trip, but the author and friends can't afford to lose the money for the trip. The author is asking if they're at fault.\n\nHmm. First, the timing issue. Save-the-dates are usually sent out several months in advance to let guests plan. If G didn't send those, maybe she's at fault for not giving enough notice. The author had already planned the trip with friends, and since they invited G, she should have known about the plans. If G knew but still scheduled the wedding so close to their trip, maybe she's responsible here.\n\nAlso, the trip is a significant financial commitment. Cancelling would be a big loss for them. The author mentions they aren't super rich, so that's a valid concern. But is a best friend's wedding something they should prioritize regardless? It depends on the expectations. If they're best friends, maybe the author is expected to attend, but if the planning was poor from G's side, that's another angle.\n\nG invited 50 people but only 20 can make it. Maybe she knew that people have conflicting plans, but the author is specifically targeted. The author's friends are also part of the trip, so maybe they all have similar commitments.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't mention trying to reschedule the trip or find a middle ground. But if the trip is already booked and non-refundable, that's a real issue. The author might feel that their commitment to the trip is valid, especially since G had prior knowledge.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author isn't in the wrong. G didn't plan properly, and the trip was planned before the wedding details were set. The author and friends can't be blamed for having prior commitments that they're financially invested in. The responsibility might lie more with G for poor communication and planning.\n"
