G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (author) is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The situation is that the friend didn't send save-the-dates and only sent actual invitations a month before the wedding. The author and their friends had already planned a trip to Australia that starts two days before the wedding. They can't cancel because it's a big financial loss. The friend is upset and expects them to drop everything.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around attending weddings. Normally, you're expected to attend if invited, especially for a close friend. But there are exceptions when there's a major conflict. The author's friends knew about the trip, so maybe the friend should have checked the dates. The short notice is a problem\u2014save-the-dates are usually sent out 6-8 months ahead. Here, the friend only gave a month's notice, which is insufficient. However, the author had already made plans, which might be a valid reason.\n\nFinancial aspect: canceling the trip would be a huge loss. If they can't get refunds or reschedule, then it's a legitimate hardship. The friend's reaction of being angry and expecting them to cancel might be unreasonable. The author isn't ignoring the wedding; they had prior commitments. But maybe the friend expects more flexibility from a best friend. However, the friend's fault in not sending early reminders complicates things. \n\nAlso, the number of guests is mentioned\u2014inviting 50 but only 20 can make it. Maybe the venue is small, but the author isn't responsible for that. The main points are the lack of save-the-date and the pre-existing trip. \n\nSo, who is at fault here? The friend messed up by not sending save-the-dates, leading to a short notice. The author had a planned trip they can't afford to cancel. The friend is upset, but the author isn't the only one to blame. The author isn't in the wrong because they had a legitimate reason and the friend didn't provide proper notice. Therefore, the answer is B\u2014author is not in the wrong.\n"
