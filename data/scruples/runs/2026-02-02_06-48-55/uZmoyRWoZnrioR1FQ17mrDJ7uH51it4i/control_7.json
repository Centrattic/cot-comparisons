G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (author) is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The key points here are the timeline of events and the reasons given for not attending.\n\nFirst, the friend G didn't send out save-the-dates and only sent invitations a month before the wedding. The author and their friends had already planned a trip to Australia, which starts two days before the wedding. They mention that G knew about the trip and was invited but didn't respond. The author is now facing backlash from G for not canceling the trip, even though it's a significant financial commitment.\n\nI need to consider social norms around weddings. Typically, save-the-dates are sent out several months in advance, often 6-8 months, and formal invitations 2-3 months before. G sent the invitations just a month before, which is on the shorter side. The author's trip was planned months ago, and they had invited G, who didn't respond. The fact that only 20 out of 50 invited guests can make it suggests that the short notice may have already affected turnout.\n\nThe author's friends aren't wealthy, so canceling the trip would be a major financial hit. This is a practical consideration. Also, the trip was planned before the wedding was even mentioned, so there's a timeline issue here. G's reaction seems disproportionate because she was aware of the trip and didn't prioritize giving a longer notice. The author isn't being selfish here; they had valid prior commitments that were made when they didn't know about the wedding. The fault might lie more with G for not sending save-the-dates and for planning the wedding too close to the date, making it hard for others to adjust their plans.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because they had a prior commitment that was planned before the wedding details were known, and G failed to communicate adequately. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
