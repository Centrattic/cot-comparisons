G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The situation is that the friend, G, didn't send a save-the-date and sent the actual invitation a month before the wedding. The author and three friends had already planned a trip to Australia that starts two days before the wedding. They invited G, who either forgot or didn't realize the timing. Now G is upset that they can't cancel the trip. The author is considering if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around weddings. Typically, save-the-dates are sent out 6-8 months in advance, and formal invitations 3-4 months out. Here, G sent the invitations a month before, which is late. That's a red flag. The author had already planned a significant trip with other friends, which they can't afford to cancel. The trip is non-refundable and costly. \n\nThe author is being accused of not prioritizing the wedding. But since the invitations came late, the author couldn't plan around it. Also, the author had informed G about the trip. It's understandable that they can't just drop everything, especially since it's a long-term plan and they're not wealthy. \n\nThe number of attendees is mentioned\u201450 invited, only 20 can make it. That might indicate that G's expectations were unreasonable given the short notice. The author's friends are also involved, so the decision isn't just about the author but a group. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The key points are the short notice from G, the prior planning of the trip, and the financial implications. The author tried to inform G but she didn't plan accordingly. In such cases, people often expect a reasonable amount of notice. Since G didn't provide that, the author isn't at fault. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
