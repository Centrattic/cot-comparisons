G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The key points here are the timing of the invitation and the existing commitment.\n\nFirst, the friend didn't send a save-the-date, only the actual invitation a month before the wedding. That's a pretty short notice, especially for something as important as a wedding. Normally, save-the-dates are sent out several months in advance to give guests time to plan. By not sending one, the friend left her guests with very little time to make arrangements.\n\nThe author and their friends had already planned a trip to Australia, which starts two days before the wedding. They couldn't just cancel last-minute without incurring significant financial loss. The author mentions they're not super rich, so this trip is a big commitment. It's understandable that they wouldn't want to throw away money like that, especially if the trip was planned well in advance.\n\nAlso, the friend invited 50 people but only expects 20 to come. That suggests that maybe she's not surprised by people not being able to attend, given the short notice. Yet, she's upset about the author and their friends not coming. That seems a bit contradictory. If she knew the notice was short, maybe she should have adjusted her expectations.\n\nThe author's fault, if any, might be not communicating their plans earlier. But since the friend didn't send save-the-date, it's on her to provide adequate notice. The author had a prior commitment that's non-flexible, and they made their friend aware of the trip, which shows they tried to be considerate. The friend forgot, which is on her.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The friend had the responsibility to give proper notice, and the author had a valid reason to not cancel their trip. The answer should be B.\n"
