G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for not attending their best friend's wedding. The friend sent the invitations just a month before the event, and the author had already planned a trip to Australia with friends, which starts two days before the wedding.\n\nFirst, the timing of the invitations is a big factor. A month's notice is quite short for a wedding, and save-the-dates are typically sent out much earlier. The author mentions that the friend knew about the trip but still sent the invites late. The friends can't cancel because they're not wealthy and it's a significant financial commitment.\n\nAlso, the friend is upset and acting like they should drop everything, but the author is standing by their plan. The friend invited 50 people but only 20 can attend due to the short notice. That shows maybe the friend knew some people might not be able to come, but still expects the author to change plans. \n\nThe key points here are the short notice, the financial aspect, and the fact that the trip was planned in advance with others. The author isn't being inconsiderate; they had prior commitments and couldn't cancel. The friend's reaction seems unreasonable given the circumstances. So, the answer should be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
