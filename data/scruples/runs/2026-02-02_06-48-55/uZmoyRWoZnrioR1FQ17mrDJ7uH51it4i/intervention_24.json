G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The friend sent invites a month before the wedding, and the author had already planned a trip to Australia with friends that they can't cancel because of financial reasons.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the timing. The friend didn't send save-the-dates and sent the actual invites a month before the wedding. That's pretty short notice, especially for an international trip. The author mentions that only 20 out of 50 invited can make it, which suggests that maybe others also couldn't attend due to the short notice. So, maybe the friend didn't give enough warning.\n\nThen, the author had planned the Australia trip months ago and invited the friend, who might have forgotten about it. The author and friends are not wealthy, so canceling would be a big financial loss. The friend is upset and expects them to drop everything, but that seems unreasonable given the circumstances.\n\nBest friends usually have each other's backs, but there's a limit. If the wedding was planned with such short notice and the trip was already set up, the author isn't to blame. The friend might have known about the trip but still scheduled the wedding without considering the existing plans. The author's decision to prioritize their trip is understandable, especially if they tried to attend but couldn't. It's not just about being in the wrong, but about the friend's responsibility to send save-the-dates and give enough time for guests to adjust their plans. So, I think the author is not in the wrong here.\n"
