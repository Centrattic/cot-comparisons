      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the details. The friend, G, didn't send out save-the-dates and only sent invitations a month before the wedding. The author and three friends had planned a trip to Australia that starts two days before the wedding. They had invited G to the trip, but she forgot about it. Now she's upset that they can't cancel the trip, which is expensive, and she expects them to be there.\n\nBest friends usually have important events like weddings, so not attending might be a big deal. But on the other hand, the author had planned the trip in advance and informed G about it. The short notice from the wedding could be a problem. If G didn't send save-the-dates, maybe she didn't prioritize that, which could mean she didn't expect others to make long-term plans around it. However, a wedding is a significant event, and best friends might expect support despite scheduling conflicts. \n\nThe financial aspect is also a factor. Cancelling a trip to Australia would be a huge loss, especially since they aren't super rich. The author might feel they've made a commitment and can't back out. Also, only 20 out of 50 guests can make it, which shows that others have scheduling issues too. G's reaction might be a bit over the top if she's expecting everyone to drop their plans.\n\nBut best friends are usually expected to prioritize each other's major life events. Even if the notice was short, the wedding is important. The author might be at fault for not making a special effort, despite the trip being planned. However, the short notice from G complicates things. Maybe G should have planned better.\n\nSo balancing both sides: the author had informed G about the trip, but maybe didn't communicate sufficiently about the importance of the wedding. G's anger might be justified if she feels slighted, but the author acted based on prior commitments and financial constraints. It's a bit of a grey area. But considering the importance of a best friend's wedding, the author might be in the wrong. However, the short notice and financial burden could mitigate that. \n\nHmm, but in many cultures, weddings are expected to be attended, even if it's a last-minute change. The trip was planned months ago, but the wedding is a one-time event. The author might have failed to adjust their plans despite the costs. So maybe AITA is on the author's side. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again.\n\nThe key points: No save-the-dates, invitations a month before. The trip was known to G, but she might have forgotten. The cost is high. The author had planned this. G is upset. The answer might depend on whether the author should have prioritized the wedding despite the trip. If the relationship is close enough, maybe they should have. But if G didn't plan well, maybe she's also at fault. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often consider the expectations. Best friends usually attend each other's weddings. Even if the notice was short, the author might be expected to make it. However, the trip was already planned and expensive. So there's a conflict between two commitments. It's a tough call. \n\nI think the answer leans towards A (the author is in the wrong) because attending a best friend's wedding is a big deal, and even with the short notice, the author might be expected to rearrange. But the financial loss is significant, and they had informed G about the trip. Maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because G didn't plan properly and the author acted in good faith. \n\nI need to decide. The author had informed G about the trip, and G didn't send save-the-dates. If the author had known the wedding was coming up, maybe they could have adjusted. But since G didn't plan well, the author can't be blamed. Also, the trip is expensive and already planned. So maybe B is correct.\n"
