G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not going to their best friend's wedding. The context is that the wedding was planned with only a month's notice, and the author had a pre-planned trip to Australia with friends that conflicts. The friend, G, is upset and thinks they should cancel the trip.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the timeline. The author mentions that G didn't send a save-the-date, only the actual invitations a month before the wedding. That's pretty short notice for most people, even for a close friend. Typically, save-the-dates are sent out several months in advance, and formal invitations maybe 6-8 weeks before. If G only gave a month's notice, that's a problem on her end for not being proactive.\n\nThen, the trip to Australia was planned a few months ago, and the author and their friends had already invited G. So they had mentioned the trip to her in advance. If G didn't consider that when planning her wedding, maybe she's at fault for not coordinating better. The author is in a position where they can't just drop the trip last minute, especially since they're not wealthy and the financial loss would be significant. That seems like a valid reason not to cancel.\n\nAlso, G invited 50 people but only expects 20 to come. The author points out that the short notice led to low turnout, which might indicate that G didn't plan properly. The author's friends are already committed to the trip, and it's not feasible to cancel. The friend's reaction seems disproportionate if she didn't give adequate notice. \n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The key points are the short notice from G, the prior planning of the trip, and the financial commitment. Since G didn't send a save-the-date and the author had already discussed the trip with her, the author isn't at fault. The friend's expectation that they should drop the trip doesn't hold because she didn't plan ahead. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
