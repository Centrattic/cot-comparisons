(so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The situation is that the friend didn't send save-the-dates and only sent the actual invitations a month before the wedding. The author and three friends had already planned a trip to Australia, which starts two days before the wedding. They can't cancel because of the cost, and the friend is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the friend's responsibility. Save-the-dates are usually sent out several months in advance to help guests plan. If the friend didn't send one, maybe the author had no way of knowing the wedding date until just a month out. That could be a problem because planning a trip takes time, and if the trip was already booked, the author wouldn't have had the chance to adjust. \n\nBut then, the author mentions that they did invite the friend to their trip. Maybe the friend didn't realize the conflict, but the author didn't mention the wedding date being an issue when they planned the trip. If the friend didn't send a save-the-date, the author might not have had the information to make other plans. However, the wedding is only a month away, and the trip is starting two days before. Even if the author tried to reschedule the trip, it might not be possible without significant financial loss.\n\nThe number of guests is 50, but only 20 can attend. That suggests that the friend might have overestimated attendance. The author's argument is that the notice was too short, making it hard for people to attend. If the friend knew about the trip but didn't send the save-the-date, maybe the author isn't at fault. On the other hand, the author could argue that they should have checked in with the friend about the wedding date earlier, even if there was no save-the-date.\n\nAnother angle is the cost. The author mentions they aren't super rich, so canceling the trip would be a huge loss. That's a valid point. Friendships require mutual consideration, but if the friend didn't plan ahead, it's not entirely the author's fault. However, the author could have tried to adjust the trip or communicate the conflict earlier. But since the friend didn't provide the date until a month before, the author might not have had the opportunity.\n\nThe friend's reaction is also a factor. If she's upset and acting like they should drop everything, maybe she's being unreasonable. The author isn't the only one in a conflict; the friend's planning issues contribute to the problem. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong here. The main issue is the friend's lack of communication and planning. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
