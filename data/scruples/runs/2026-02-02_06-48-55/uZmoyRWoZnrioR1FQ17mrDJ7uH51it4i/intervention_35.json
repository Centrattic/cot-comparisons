G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for not attending their best friend's wedding. The situation is that the author and three friends planned a trip to Australia, which starts two days before the wedding. The friend G didn't send a save-the-date and only sent the invites a month before. The author didn't cancel the trip because it's a big financial commitment, and G is upset because she thinks they should have dropped everything for her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the responsibilities of both sides. The author had informed G about the trip in advance, but G didn't send a save-the-date. Save-the-dates are usually sent 6-8 months out to give guests time to plan. By only sending invites a month before, G didn't give enough notice. The author had plans that were already agreed upon with friends, which are costly to cancel. Financial constraints are a real issue here, especially if they're not super rich.\n\nBest friends might expect each other to be there for major events, but if G didn't communicate properly, that's on her. The author could argue that they did their part by inviting her to the trip and she didn't follow up. Also, G is inviting 50 people but only expecting 20 to show up because of the short notice. That shows she might have known some people couldn't make it. \n\nThe author isn't in the wrong because G didn't give proper notice. They had a prior commitment that was expensive to cancel. It's reasonable to expect that major life events like weddings should be planned with enough time for guests. So, the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
