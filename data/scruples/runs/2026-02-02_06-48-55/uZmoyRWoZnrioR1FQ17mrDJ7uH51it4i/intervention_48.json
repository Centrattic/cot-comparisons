G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for not attending their best friend's wedding. The situation is that the wedding was planned with only a one-month notice, and the author had already committed to a trip to Australia that starts two days before the wedding. The friends involved aren't wealthy, so canceling the trip would be a big financial loss. The friend is upset that they didn't just cancel the trip to attend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations in friendships, especially regarding major events like weddings. Typically, people expect their close friends to attend their weddings. However, the author's friend didn't send out save-the-dates, which are usually sent months in advance. This lack of early communication might have contributed to the problem. The author had already planned a trip, which they informed the friend about, so the friend should have been aware of the commitment. \n\nThe key points here are the timing of the invitation and the prior commitment. The author isn't the only one at fault here. The friend's short notice complicates things. Also, the financial aspect is a real issue for the author and their friends, making it impractical to cancel the trip. The friend's reaction of being angry and expecting them to drop everything might be unreasonable, especially given the circumstances. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties share some blame. The author could have tried to find a compromise, like attending part of the wedding if possible, but the trip's timing might not allow that. The friend's failure to plan adequately with save-the-dates is a significant factor. Therefore, the author isn't entirely in the wrong. They made a commitment beforehand, and the friend's planning was insufficient. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
