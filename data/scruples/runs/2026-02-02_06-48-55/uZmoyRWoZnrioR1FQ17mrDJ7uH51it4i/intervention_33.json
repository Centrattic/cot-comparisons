G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding because they had a planned trip to Australia. \n\nFirst, the friend didn't send a save-the-date, just the actual invite a month before the wedding. The trip was planned a few months ago, and the friend knew about it. The author and friends can't afford to cancel the trip, so they're choosing not to go. The friend is upset and feels they should drop everything.\n\nHmm, what's the norm here? Usually, save-the-dates are sent out several months in advance, but the friend didn't do that. The author's friends had already committed to the Australia trip when they invited the friend. So the friend knew about the trip but still planned the wedding. Maybe she didn't realize the dates would conflict. \n\nOn the other hand, weddings are usually expected to have guests, so maybe the author should have tried to reschedule or adjust the trip. But the trip was planned a while ago, and the cost is prohibitive. The friend invited 50 people but only 20 can attend. That's a small guest list, so maybe it's a destination wedding. But since it's at her grandmother's ranch, maybe it's not that hard to get to. Still, the author can't afford to cancel.\n\nI think the key points are: the friend didn't give enough notice, the trip was planned and known about, and the financial burden is real. The author isn't being inconsiderate because the trip was already in place when the friend was aware. The friend might be overreacting. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
