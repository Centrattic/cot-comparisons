G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The friend, G, sent the invitations only a month before the wedding, which is pretty short notice. The author and their friends had already planned a trip to Australia that starts two days before the wedding. They mention that G knew about the trip because they invited her, and she might have forgotten. The author is now getting mad at them for not canceling the trip, even though it's a significant financial commitment. The author is wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations in such situations. Typically, save-the-dates are sent out well in advance, sometimes 6-12 months before the wedding, so that guests can plan. G didn't send one, only the actual invitations a month before. That's definitely short notice. If the author and friends had known about the wedding earlier, maybe they could have adjusted their plans. But they had already made a trip that they couldn't easily change. \n\nThen there's the fact that the trip was planned with other friends, so canceling would affect more people than just the author. The financial aspect is a big factor too; they mentioned they're not super rich, so the cost is a significant loss. \n\nOn the other hand, weddings are important events, and being a best friend might lead one to expect more flexibility. However, the author did inform G about the trip, so G had the chance to send the save-the-date earlier. If G forgot or ignored the save-the-date, that's on her. Also, the author isn't the only one in this situation\u2014three friends are involved, which might dilute individual responsibility.\n\nI think the key points here are the lack of save-the-date from G, the short notice given, and the fact that the author wasn't the one who initially planned the trip alone. The author's friends are also involved, so it's not just their decision. Considering all that, the author is probably not in the wrong. The responsibility here might lie more with G for not providing adequate notice. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
