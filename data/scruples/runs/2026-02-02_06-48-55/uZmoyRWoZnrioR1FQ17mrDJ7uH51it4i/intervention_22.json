G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding.\n\nFirst, the key points from the story: The author's best friend, G, didn't send out save-the-dates and only sent invitations a month before the wedding. The author and three friends had already planned a trip to Australia that starts two days before the wedding. They couldn't afford to cancel, and G is upset that they're not attending. The author mentions that G invited 50 people, but only 20 can make it due to the short notice.\n\nNow, considering social norms and expectations around weddings. Typically, you give save-the-dates and formal invitations several months in advance. G's failure to do so is a significant oversight. As a best friend, the author would likely be expected to be there, but the timing and lack of notice complicate things. \n\nThe author and friends had planned the trip in advance and couldn't afford to cancel. Financial constraints are real, and if it's a significant loss, that's a valid point. However, the author is prioritizing a trip over a best friend's wedding. Even if the trip was planned before, the responsibility also lies with G for not providing enough notice. \n\nThere's a cultural expectation that close friends attend weddings, but when the invitees are given such short notice, it's not entirely the guests' fault. The author's defense is that the friend should have planned better. However, the author might still feel obligated to attend, leading to conflict. \n\nBut the main issue here is the friend's poor planning. The author isn't in the wrong because they couldn't change their plans and the wedding was announced too late. The friend should have been more considerate of others' commitments. So, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
