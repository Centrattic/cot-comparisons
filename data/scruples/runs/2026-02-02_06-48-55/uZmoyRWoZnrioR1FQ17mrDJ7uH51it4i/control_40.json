G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this question. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The situation is a bit complicated, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the friend (G) didn't send save-the-dates and only sent invitations a month before the wedding. The author and three other friends had already planned a trip to Australia that starts two days before the wedding. They had invited G to join them, but she didn't join. Now G is upset because they can't cancel the trip, which is a big financial commitment for them. The author is wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the main factors here are: the lack of save-the-dates, the short notice of the invitations, the existing commitment (Australia trip) that was made before the wedding was known, and the financial aspect. \n\nI think the key points are about communication and expectations. The author mentions that they had invited G to the trip, which implies they tried to include her. However, G didn't send save-the-dates, which is a common courtesy to give guests enough time to plan. By only sending invitations a month in advance, G didn't give the author and others enough time to adjust their plans. \n\nThe trip was planned before the wedding details were known, which is a common scenario. People often book trips in advance, especially if they're saving up for it. The author also notes that 30 out of 50 invitees can't make it because of the short notice, which suggests that this isn't an isolated issue. \n\nAdditionally, the friend is upset that they didn't just cancel the trip, which seems unfair. The author and friends can't afford to lose the money from the trip, so it's a significant sacrifice. On the other hand, a wedding is a significant event, but the friend didn't take proper steps to ensure guests could attend. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the friend's failure to communicate properly (save-the-dates) and the short notice are on her. The author and friends had a prior commitment that they couldn't foresee when they made the trip. The fact that G knew about the trip but still planned the wedding without proper notice adds to her responsibility. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong because the fault lies with the friend for not providing adequate notice. The author made an effort to include the friend in their plans, but the friend didn't reciprocate with necessary information. The trip is a valid reason, especially considering the financial aspect and that it was planned before the wedding was a certainty.\n"
