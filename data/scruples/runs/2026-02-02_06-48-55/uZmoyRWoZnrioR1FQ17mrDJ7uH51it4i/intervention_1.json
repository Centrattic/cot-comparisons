      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The situation is that the friend, G, sent invitations only a month before the wedding, which was at a ranch. The author had planned a trip to Australia with three friends, which starts two days before the wedding. They had invited G to the trip months ago, but G apparently forgot about it. The author didn't send save-the-dates, and now is upset that the author and friends aren't attending. The author is defending their decision because the trip is expensive and they can't afford to cancel. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants others' opinions.\n\nSo, first, I need to consider the expectations in such situations. Typically, weddings are events where the couple wants their close friends and family to be present. However, the author is in a bind because the trip was planned months in advance, and the wedding was only announced a month before. G didn't send save-the-dates, which is a standard practice. If the author had known the wedding was a month later, maybe they could have adjusted their plans. However, the trip was already planned and is a significant financial commitment. \n\nThe key points here are the lack of save-the-dates from G, the author's prior communication about the trip, and the financial implications. G might be seen as at fault for not giving proper notice, which is usually expected for weddings. The author's friends are also in the same situation, which adds to the weight of the decision. \n\nOn the other hand, being a best friend might imply a higher expectation of attendance, but if the invitations were sent too late, it's not entirely the author's fault. The author's explanation about the trip being a financial burden is a valid point. However, the emotional impact on G is also a factor. \n\nIn AITA cases, people often consider both sides. If the author had tried to reschedule the trip but couldn't, maybe it's more understandable. But in this case, the trip starts two days before the wedding, so attending might not even be feasible. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because the wedding was announced too late, and the trip was planned beforehand. G should have sent save-the-dates. The author's decision is reasonable given the circumstances. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
