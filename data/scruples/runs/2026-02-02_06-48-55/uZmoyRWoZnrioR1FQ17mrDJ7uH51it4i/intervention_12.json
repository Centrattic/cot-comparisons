(so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The situation is that the friend didn't send save-the-dates and only sent invitations a month before the wedding. The author had planned a trip to Australia with friends that starts two days before the wedding. They mentioned the trip to the friend before, but the friend forgot. The friend is upset and wants them to cancel.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations of attending a wedding. Typically, people expect save-the-dates to be sent out several months in advance, maybe 6-8 months, and invitations 3-4 months before. Here, the friend sent invitations only a month in advance, which is shorter than usual. That could be a problem because it gives guests less time to plan their schedules. The author had already planned a trip, which they couldn't cancel because of financial reasons. \n\nThe author's defense is that the friend didn't give enough notice. On the other hand, the friend is upset and thinks the author should drop everything. But the author might not be at fault because the friend didn't follow standard etiquette with the invitations. Also, the author tried to communicate about the trip earlier, but the friend didn't remember. \n\nConsidering the financial aspect, cancelling the trip would be a big loss, which adds weight to the author's decision. The friend invited 50 people, but only 20 can attend because of the short notice. That suggests the friend might have overestimated how many people could come. The author's friends are also not in the wrong for not cancelling their plans. \n\nSo, the main points are the short notice from the friend and the pre-existing commitment. The author probably isn't in the wrong because the friend didn't give adequate notice, making it hard to attend. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
