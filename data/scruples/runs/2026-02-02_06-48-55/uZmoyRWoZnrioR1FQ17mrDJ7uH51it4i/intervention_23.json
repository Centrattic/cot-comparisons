(so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenario is at fault. The situation is that the author's best friend, G, is getting married, but the author didn't attend because they had a planned trip to Australia. The key points are that G didn't send save-the-dates, only sent the actual invitations a month before the wedding, and the trip starts two days before the wedding. The author and friends had planned the trip months earlier and had invited G, who apparently forgot about it. Now G is upset they're not attending.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's side: they planned a trip that they've been looking forward to, maybe saved for, and it's a significant financial commitment. They informed G about the trip, but she didn't send save-the-dates, so the invitations came late. G invited 50 people, but only 20 can attend because of the short notice. The author is arguing that it's not their responsibility to cancel a trip they've already planned, especially since they weren't given enough notice.\n\nG's side: She's getting married, which is a major life event. She might feel that close friends would prioritize her wedding over other plans. The fact that she didn't send save-the-dates is a mistake, but she might still expect her best friend to adjust plans. Her being upset could be because of the short notice, but she's holding the author responsible for not attending.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion. \n\nFactors to consider: Did the author have a right to plan a trip with friends, especially when the wedding details came so late? How much notice is considered reasonable for a wedding? Typically, save-the-dates are sent 6-8 months in advance, and invitations 2-3 months before. Here, G sent the invites a month before, which is on the short side. So she did have a responsibility to communicate earlier. The author had already planned this trip, which started two days before the wedding, making it impossible to attend. \n\nThe author might not be at fault because G didn't give proper notice. However, the author could have tried to adjust if possible. But given the short notice and the trip's timing, there's little flexibility. Also, the author mentioned the financial aspect, which adds weight to their decision. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author should have been more understanding since it's a close friend's wedding. But the friend's oversight in not sending save-the-dates contributed to the problem. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, G is partially at fault for not giving enough notice. The author had informed her about the trip, so she knew about the plans. The author's friends are in the same boat. The fact that many people can't attend due to the short notice suggests that the problem isn't just the author's.\n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The main issue is G's failure to communicate properly. The author made their plans known and had a legitimate reason to decline. Therefore, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
