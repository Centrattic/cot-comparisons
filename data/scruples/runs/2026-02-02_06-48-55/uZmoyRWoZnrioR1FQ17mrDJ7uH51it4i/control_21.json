      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about not attending a best friend's wedding because they didn't get a save-the-date and the trip to Australia was already planned.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The friend (G) didn't send a save-the-date, just the actual invitations a month before the wedding. The author and three friends had planned a trip to Australia, which starts two days before the wedding. They had invited G to the trip, but she forgot. Now, G is upset that they can't cancel the trip and attend the wedding. The author argues that the trip was expensive, they can't afford to cancel, and only 20 out of 50 invited guests can make it because of the short notice.\n\nSo, the main factors here are the timing of the invitation, the prior commitment, financial implications, and the friend's reaction. \n\nSave-the-dates are typically sent several months in advance to help guests plan. G didn't send one, which is a common courtesy. The author and friends had already planned a trip, which is a significant expense. They had even invited G to the trip, which she was aware of. Now, G is upset, but the short notice complicates things. If the author had known about the wedding earlier, maybe they could have adjusted their plans, but G didn't give them that chance. \n\nAlso, the fact that only a third of the guests can attend due to the short notice suggests that others are also struggling with the timing. The author isn't the only one who can't make it. \n\nThe friend's reaction seems to be out of proportion, expecting the author to drop a planned, expensive trip, especially since the author had already informed her about the trip. It's possible that G made a mistake in not sending a save-the-date and now is holding the author responsible for not changing plans at the last minute. \n\nFinancial hardship is another point. Cancelling a trip to Australia two weeks before departure would likely result in significant non-refundable costs, which would be a big loss for them. \n\nIn terms of social etiquette, guests are generally expected to attend weddings of close friends, but when there's a short notice and a prior commitment, it's understandable that they might not be able to attend. The fault here might lie more with the bride for not providing enough notice. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They had a prior commitment that was known to the friend, the bride didn't follow standard etiquette with a save-the-date, and the financial aspect makes it difficult to cancel. The answer should be B.\n"
