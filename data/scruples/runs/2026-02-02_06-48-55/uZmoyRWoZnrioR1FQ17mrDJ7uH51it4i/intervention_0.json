      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The situation is that the friend didn't send save-the-dates and just sent invitations a month before the wedding. The author had already planned a trip to Australia with three friends, which starts two days before the wedding. They mentioned the trip to the friend before, but the friend might have forgotten. The friend is now upset and wants them to cancel the trip.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around weddings. Usually, save-the-dates are sent out several months in advance, especially for destination weddings or those at a family's ranch. The author's friend didn't send a save-the-date, only an invitation a month earlier. That's pretty short notice, especially if the wedding is at her grandmother's ranch, which might require travel or other arrangements. So the friend's poor planning is a factor here.\n\nThe author and their friends had already planned a trip, which they mentioned to the friend beforehand. Since the friend didn't send a save-the-date, maybe she assumed people could adjust their plans. But the author's trip is a big financial commitment. They're not super rich, so canceling would be a huge loss. \n\nThe friend is upset and acting like they should drop everything. But the author had prior commitments that were known. If the friend had given more notice, maybe they could adjust. However, the short notice combined with pre-existing plans complicates things. \n\nIn relationships, there's an expectation of being there for important events, but if the event was poorly planned (no save-the-date, last-minute invite), the onus is on the host. The author's decision to prioritize their trip, especially after the friend's own planning mistake, might be reasonable. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. The friend should have planned better and given more notice. The answer should be B (No).\n"
