G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The situation is that the friend didn't send a save-the-date and just sent the invites a month before the wedding. The author and their friends had already planned a trip to Australia that starts two days before the wedding. They couldn't cancel because it's a big financial hit, and they're not rich. The friend is upset and thinks they should drop everything.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's side: They planned the trip months in advance and the friend didn't give enough notice. The friend's side: Weddings are important, and they might expect close friends to be there, especially since the author mentioned the friend knew about the trip but still planned the wedding around it. But the friend didn't send a save-the-date, which is a common practice to avoid such conflicts. \n\nIs the author at fault? Well, maybe they should have double-checked the date earlier, but the friend didn't provide enough notice. Also, if the author had known the wedding was a month away, maybe they could have adjusted their plans. But the trip was planned months ago, and the friend didn't inform them in time. On the other hand, the friend might feel slighted if the author prioritizes a trip over the wedding. However, the author is in a financial situation where they can't afford to cancel. \n\nI think the key points are the lack of save-the-date and the short notice. If you're a best friend, you might expect more consideration, but the friend's part in not giving proper notice plays a role. The author isn't in the wrong because the friend didn't communicate adequately. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
