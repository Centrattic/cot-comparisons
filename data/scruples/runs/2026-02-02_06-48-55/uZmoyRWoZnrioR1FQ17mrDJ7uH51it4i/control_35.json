G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The main points here are the timing of the invitation, the prior commitment, and the friend's reaction.\n\nFirst, the friend didn't send a save-the-date and only sent the actual invitations a month before the wedding. That's pretty last-minute, which is a common issue. Generally, save-the-dates are sent out 6-8 months in advance, and formal invitations 2-3 months. So the friend messed up on the timeline, which is part of the problem.\n\nThe author and three friends had planned an Australia trip months ago, which the friend knew about. But the friend still sent the invitations too late. The author is now in a dilemma between a planned trip and the wedding. Since the trip started two days before the wedding, attending the wedding would require canceling or cutting short the trip, which is expensive and impractical, especially since they're not super rich. \n\nThe friend is upset and acting like they should drop everything, but the author isn't at fault here. The friend didn't give adequate notice, and the trip was already planned. The author's friends can't afford to lose that money, so they have a valid reason to go. Also, the friend is inviting 50 people but only 20 can make it, which suggests maybe the friend isn't managing expectations well. \n\nSo the author isn't in the wrong. The fault lies with the friend for not sending early enough and the author has a legitimate reason to go on the trip. The answer should be B.\n"
