      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The situation is that the friend, G, sent the actual invitations only a month before the wedding, which is pretty short notice. The author and three friends had already planned a trip to Australia that starts two days before the wedding, so they can't cancel now. They mention that G knew about the trip but probably forgot about the date. The author is also pointing out that G invited 50 people, but only 20 are expected to come. G is upset and acting like they should drop everything to attend.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the key points here. The main issue is the timing of the wedding invitations. Save the dates aren't sent out, so the actual invites came the week before, giving just a month's notice. That's a red flag because typically weddings require more lead time, so people can make arrangements. The author's trip was planned a few months ago, and G was invited, so she had the chance to know about it. But she still scheduled her wedding around that time without sending a save the date. Now, the author is stuck between a planned trip and a wedding that was announced too late.\n\nThe friends are not super rich, so cancelling would be a huge financial loss. That's a valid point because people might have already booked flights, accommodations, or have other expenses. Also, the author is emphasizing that G is upset, but the responsibility for the short notice lies with G. The fact that only 20 out of 50 invited guests can make it suggests that maybe she didn't plan well, leading to this situation. \n\nIn terms of social expectations, attending a best friend's wedding is usually a big deal, but if the wedding was planned so late, the guests can't be expected to drop their existing commitments. The author wasn't given enough time to adjust their plans, and the trip was already a shared plan with others. So the author isn't in the wrong here because G is the one who didn't communicate properly. The answer should be B, meaning the author is not in the wrong.\n"
