G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding.\n\nFirst, the key points: The friend (G) didn't send save-the-dates and only sent invitations a month before the wedding. The author and their friends had planned a trip to Australia months ago, which starts two days before the wedding. They couldn't cancel because of financial reasons, and G is upset they didn't drop everything to attend. The wedding is at G's grandmother's ranch, and not many people can make it because of the short notice.\n\nSo, the author argues that G didn't give enough notice, and they had a pre-existing commitment they can't afford to cancel. On the other hand, G expected them to prioritize her wedding over their trip. \n\nI need to consider cultural expectations around attending weddings. Usually, people are expected to attend if they're invited, especially close friends. But the short notice is a factor here. Save-the-dates are typically sent out months in advance, so not sending them is a mistake on G's part. The author and friends had a planned trip, which they informed G about. If G forgot or didn't consider the timing, that's her responsibility. \n\nAlso, the author mentions G is upset because only 20 out of 50 invitees can attend. That might add to her frustration, but it's not the guests' fault. Financial constraints are a real issue here; canceling a trip could be costly, so the author isn't in a position to easily drop their plans. \n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author didn't have the information early enough due to G's oversight and had a valid reason not to cancel. While attending a friend's wedding is important, the circumstances here (short notice and financial impact) might justify their decision. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
