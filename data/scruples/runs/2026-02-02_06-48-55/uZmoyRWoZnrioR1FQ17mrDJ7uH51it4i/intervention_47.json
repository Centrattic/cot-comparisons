G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The situation is that the friend, G, didn't send save-the-dates and just sent invitations a month before the wedding. The author and their friends had already planned a trip to Australia, which starts two days before the wedding. They can't cancel because it's expensive, and G is upset they didn't just drop their plans.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, weddings are usually important events, and the best friend might expect their close friend to be there. But on the other hand, the author's friend didn't give much notice. Save-the-dates are usually sent out way in advance, so if G didn't send those, maybe she's at fault for not planning properly. The author and friends had already committed to the trip and informed G, so if G forgot about the trip, that's on her. Also, the author mentions that only 20 out of 50 invited people can make it because of the short notice, which shows that G's planning was disorganized. \n\nThe author is probably feeling that they're justified in not canceling their trip because the wedding was poorly planned. They also mention that it's a financial hardship to cancel, which adds to their dilemma. The key points here are the lack of save-the-dates, the short notice, and the fact that the trip was planned in advance with G being aware. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the friend didn't plan properly, then the author isn't entirely at fault. The author tried to inform G about the trip, so they can't be blamed for not changing their plans. However, some might argue that a best friend's wedding is a priority, but given the circumstances, the author's hands are tied. Therefore, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
