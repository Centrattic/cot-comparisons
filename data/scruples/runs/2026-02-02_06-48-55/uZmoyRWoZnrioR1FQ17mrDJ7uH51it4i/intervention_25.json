G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The main points are:\n\n1. The friend (G) didn't send a save-the-date, only the actual invitation a month before the wedding.\n2. The author had planned a trip to Australia with friends, starting two days before the wedding. They couldn't change plans because of financial reasons.\n3. G is upset and expects them to cancel the trip, but the author and friends can't afford to lose the money.\n4. G invited 50 people, but only 20 can attend due to the short notice.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations in friendships. Best friends often have a closer bond, so maybe there's an expectation to attend important events. However, the author did inform G about the trip in advance. G's responsibility is to check dates when sending invitations. If the author mentioned the trip to G before planning, maybe G should have adjusted accordingly. But since the invitation came only a month before, which is short notice, that's on G. The author might not be at fault because they communicated their plans ahead of time, and the trip's timing was beyond their control once the invitation was sent. Financial constraints are also a valid reason. The fact that G invited many people but expects close friends to attend despite the short notice adds complexity. The author might not be in the wrong because they made their plans known and can't afford to cancel. So the answer would be B, No.\n"
