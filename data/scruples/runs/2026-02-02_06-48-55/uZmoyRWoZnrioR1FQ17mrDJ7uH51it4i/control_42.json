G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The friend didn't send save-the-dates and only sent the actual invitations a month before the wedding. The person had already planned a trip to Australia with three friends, which starts two days before the wedding. They couldn't cancel because it's a big financial hit.\n\nFirst, the friend's responsibility: Save-the-dates are usually sent out months in advance, like 6-8 months before the wedding. By not sending one, the friend (G) left them with very short notice. That's a problem because planning trips, especially international ones, takes time and money. If G had sent a save-the-date, maybe the person could have adjusted their plans. But since she didn't, she's partly responsible for the conflict.\n\nThen there's the financial aspect. The person mentioned they're not super rich. Cancelling a trip planned months in advance would be a huge loss. It's understandable that they can't just drop everything and lose that money. The friend is expecting them to cancel, but that's not fair because she didn't give enough notice. \n\nAlso, the friend invited 50 people but only 20 can make it. That shows that others also have conflicts, but the person is being singled out. Maybe the friend is overreacting because she expected them to prioritize her wedding over their trip. However, the person had already made arrangements and the friend didn't communicate properly. \n\nIn relationships, there's a mutual expectation of communication. The friend didn't set a clear timeline, and the person did inform her about the trip. So the fault isn't entirely on the person. They did their part by inviting her, but didn't give enough notice. The person can't be blamed for the short notice since they were invited to the trip. \n\nSo putting it all together, the person isn't in the wrong. The main issues are G's lack of communication and the financial burden of last-minute cancellations. The answer should be B (No).\n"
