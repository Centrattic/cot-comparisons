G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The main points are:\n\n1. The friend (G) didn't send save-the-dates, only sent the actual invitations a month before the wedding.\n2. The author and friends had planned a trip to Australia that starts two days before the wedding, so they can't attend. They mentioned the trip to G before, but she didn't send the save-the-date, leading to this conflict.\n3. The author feels they shouldn't cancel the trip because it's expensive and they're not rich. G is upset and expects them to drop everything for her wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's side: They had a planned trip that they had discussed with G. G didn't send a save-the-date, so maybe she assumed the trip wasn't conflicting. The author's friends are also part of this, but the question is about the author specifically. \n\nG's side: She's the one getting married and might feel hurt that her best friend isn't there. She sent the invitations a month out, which is shorter than the typical 6-8 months. However, the author and friends knew about the trip beforehand but didn't confirm if the dates would conflict. \n\nI think the key factors here are communication and expectations. If the author had known the wedding was a month away but didn't adjust their plans, maybe they should have. But G didn't give enough notice. Also, the trip is a shared plan with friends, not just the author's individual choice. \n\nThe author might be in the right because G didn't provide a save-the-date, leading to a conflict. But maybe the author should have checked the dates earlier. However, since the trip was already planned and known to G, perhaps she should have adjusted the wedding dates if possible. \n\nOn the other hand, best friends might expect attendance at a wedding. But the author is facing financial loss and the short notice might be on G's part. I think the author is not in the wrong because the main fault lies with G for not providing a save-the-date and the short notice. The author had a prior commitment communicated, so they can't be blamed for not cancelling.\n"
