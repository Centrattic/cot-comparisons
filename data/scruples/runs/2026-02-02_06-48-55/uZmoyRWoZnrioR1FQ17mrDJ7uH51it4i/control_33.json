      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The situation is that the friend, G, didn't send save-the-dates and only sent the actual invites a month before the wedding. The author and three friends had already planned a trip to Australia that starts two days before the wedding. They couldn't cancel because it's a big financial loss and they aren't super rich. G is upset and acting like they should drop everything for her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations in friendships. Usually, best friends expect each other to be there for major events like weddings. But in this case, the problem is that the wedding was only announced a month in advance. Save-the-dates are typically sent out several months ahead to make planning easier for guests. Without that, guests might have a hard time adjusting their schedules, especially if they've already made other plans.\n\nThe author and friends had a trip planned for months, which started right before the wedding. They invited G to the trip, but she forgot about it. So, she knew about the trip but still scheduled the wedding without proper notice. That seems like a misstep on her part. She might have assumed they could reschedule, but given the short notice and the financial implications, it's not feasible for them to cancel.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that only 20 out of 50 invitees can attend because of the short notice. That shows that the problem isn't just with the author but with a significant portion of the guests. If only 40% of the people she invited can make it, maybe the issue is more about her planning and not just the author's decision.\n\nHowever, the emotional aspect is there. The author is a best friend, and weddings are considered important events. The author might feel conflicted because they care about G but also have commitments and financial constraints. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for prioritizing their trip over the wedding.\n\nLooking at similar AITA cases, often if someone has a non-negotiable commitment that was made in good faith and can't be changed without significant loss, they aren't considered in the wrong, especially if the event planner (in this case, G) didn't provide adequate notice. The key factors here are the lack of save-the-date, the short notice, and the pre-existing plans that can't be undone without financial loss. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because G didn't give proper notice, and they had a valid reason for not attending. The financial aspect adds weight to the decision. Also, the fact that many others can't attend for the same reason suggests it's a broader issue with G's planning, not just the author's choice.\n"
