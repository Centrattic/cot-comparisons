G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding.\n\nFirst, the key facts: The best friend, G, didn't send a save-the-date, only the actual invite a month before the wedding. The author and three friends had planned a trip to Australia, which starts two days before the wedding. They couldn't change their plans because it's a significant financial commitment. G knew about the trip but still sent the invite so late that there's no way to adjust. G is upset and acting like they should cancel the trip.\n\nI need to consider the norms around weddings and expectations. Typically, save-the-dates are sent out several months in advance to allow guests to make plans. G didn't do this, which is a common mistake but still a problem. The author had informed G about the trip, so G should have been aware of the conflict. The fact that the trip is already planned and a financial burden adds weight to the author's position. Also, only 20 out of 50 invited guests can make it because of the short notice, which suggests that G's planning was flawed. \n\nFriendships involve mutual respect, but in this case, G's failure to plan properly and the late notice might mean the author isn't at fault. The author had a prior commitment that they can't easily cancel, especially financially. The friend's reaction seems unreasonable given the circumstances. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
