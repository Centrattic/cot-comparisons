G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The key points are:\n\n1. The friend (G) didn't send save-the-dates and only sent invitations a month before the wedding.\n2. The author and friends had planned a trip to Australia, which starts two days before the wedding.\n3. The author mentions that they invited G to the trip, but she might have forgotten about it.\n4. The wedding is at her grandmother's ranch, and only 20 out of 50 invitees can attend because of the short notice.\n5. G is upset and expects them to cancel the trip.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations of attending a wedding, especially for a best friend. Weddings are significant events, and people often expect close friends to be there. However, the author's decision is based on a pre-planned trip they can't afford to cancel. \n\nThe fact that G didn't send save-the-dates is a problem. Save-the-dates are typically sent 6-8 months in advance, and formal invites 2-3 months. By waiting until a month before, G might have contributed to the situation where friends couldn't adjust their plans. \n\nThe author and friends had planned the trip months ago and invited G, but she didn't take it into account when scheduling the wedding. Now, they're being asked to cancel a trip they can't afford to lose. Financial constraints are a real issue here, so it's not just about preference but necessity.\n\nG's reaction of being upset and expecting them to drop everything might be seen as unreasonable, especially since the notice was too short. The author isn't the only one at fault here. However, the question is specifically about the author's actions. \n\nIn terms of friendship, attending a best friend's wedding is often expected. But if the wedding was planned without proper notice, the onus is partially on the friend. The author might feel they have a valid reason, but emotionally, the friend might feel hurt. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author is in the wrong for not attending. Given the short notice and financial constraints, the author isn't entirely at fault. However, there's an expectation for close friends to attend, which complicates things. \n\nBut since the friend didn't provide adequate notice, and the trip was planned months in advance, the author's decision makes sense. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong). However, if the expectation is higher for best friends, maybe A. But given the circumstances, B seems more likely.\n"
