      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The writer had planned a trip to Australia with three friends that starts two days before the wedding, and they can't change the plans. The friend didn't send a save-the-date and only invited 50 people, expecting everyone to come, but only 20 are attending because of the short notice.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The writer and their friends had planned the trip months in advance, and the friend knew about it. The problem is the short notice of the wedding. Save-the-dates are usually sent a few months in advance to give guests time to plan. Since the friend didn't send one, maybe the writer didn't have enough time to adjust their schedule. The trip is a big financial commitment, and canceling it would be a significant loss. \n\nThe friend is upset and acting like they should drop everything. But is the writer at fault here? They did invite the friend, but the friend didn't send save-the-dates. The writer's friends were also invited and knew about the trip. So the writer isn't the only one who's going to miss the wedding. The friend might be frustrated, but if the invitations were sent late, the guests can't be blamed for not being able to adjust their plans. \n\nAlso, the friend only got 20 out of 50 people to come with such short notice. That's a big problem for the wedding. Maybe the friend overestimated the number of attendees, which is her own issue. The writer is in a tight spot because they can't afford to cancel the trip. \n\nI think the answer is B, the writer isn't in the wrong. They made their plans known, the friend didn't give enough notice, and it's a mutual misunderstanding. The writer can't be expected to cancel a trip they've already committed to, especially when the friend didn't send save-the-dates. The friend should be more understanding given the circumstances.\n"
