G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a best friend's wedding that was scheduled without a save-the-date, leading to a last-minute invite. The person had already planned a trip to Australia with friends that conflicts with the wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The friend didn't send a save-the-date, so the invite came just a month before the event. The trip was planned earlier, and the friend was aware of it. The person can't afford to cancel the trip, which is a big deal for them. Also, the wedding has low attendance because of the short notice.\n\nSo, the main factors here are: Did the friend give adequate notice? The lack of a save-the-date is a problem. The trip was planned before the wedding date was set, and the friend knew about it. The person is being asked to cancel a trip they can't afford to lose. The friend is upset, but maybe she's responsible for not providing enough notice. \n\nThe community usually considers both sides. If the wedding was planned without proper communication, it's on the bride to be considerate. The person in question isn't being unethical, just prioritizing a planned commitment. The answer is likely B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
