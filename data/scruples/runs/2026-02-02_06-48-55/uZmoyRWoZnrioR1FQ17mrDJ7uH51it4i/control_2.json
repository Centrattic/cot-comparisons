G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The situation is that the author and some friends planned a trip to Australia, which starts two days before the wedding. The friend G didn't send a save-the-date and only sent the actual invitation a month before the wedding. Now G is upset and expects them to cancel the trip.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations here. Best friends usually expect each other to be there for big events like weddings. But the author didn't know about the wedding date until last week, and the trip was already planned months ago. The friend G knew about the trip but didn't respond, maybe forgot. The author and friends can't afford to cancel because it's a big financial hit. Also, only 20 out of 50 invitees can make it, so maybe G is aware that not everyone can come.\n\nOn one hand, the author might be seen as letting down their best friend, especially since they were close. On the other hand, the wedding was planned without a save-the-date, which is usually a standard courtesy to give guests time to make arrangements. The short notice combined with an already planned trip that's non-refundable or expensive to cancel could be a valid reason. The friend G's reaction of being angry and expecting them to drop everything might be unreasonable, especially if she didn't communicate properly in the first place.\n\nAlso, the fact that G invited 50 people but only 20 can attend suggests that maybe she's not expecting most people to come, which could add to the argument that the author isn't the only one missing. The friends had to plan the trip in advance, which is typical for such trips, so it's understandable they can't just cancel. \n\nSo, putting it all together: The author isn't in the wrong because the friend didn't give proper notice, the trip was planned well in advance, and the financial burden is significant. The friend's expectations might be too high given the circumstances. Therefore, the answer should be B (No)."
