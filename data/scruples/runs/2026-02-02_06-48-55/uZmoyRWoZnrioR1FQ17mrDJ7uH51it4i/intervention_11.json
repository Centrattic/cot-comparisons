G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is at fault for not attending their best friend's wedding. The situation is that the wedding is in a month, and the author found out last week when they got the actual invitations. They had already planned a trip to Australia with friends, which starts two days before the wedding. The friend (G) is upset because they didn't cancel the trip. The author argues that the trip is a big financial commitment and they can't just drop it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms around weddings. Typically, attending a best friend's wedding is expected, especially if you're close. But the author didn't get a save-the-date, only the actual invites a month before. That's a problem because save-the-dates are usually sent out 6-8 months in advance. G should have sent one. Without that, the author and others couldn't plan around the trip. Also, they did invite G to the trip, so maybe G knew about it but still scheduled the wedding around that time. \n\nThen there's the financial aspect. If the trip is already booked and non-refundable, cancelling would be a huge loss. The author mentions they aren't wealthy, so that's a valid concern. The number of guests is 50, but only 20 can make it because of the short notice. That suggests maybe G didn't plan well, but it doesn't excuse the author's decision. \n\nOn the other hand, being a best friend might mean making sacrifices, like prioritizing the wedding. But if the trip was planned well in advance and G knew about it, then maybe G is also at fault for not being more considerate. The author might be right to stick with their plans since the wedding was announced so late. \n\nI think the key points are the lack of save-the-date, the financial impact of cancelling, and the fact that G was aware of the trip. The author's responsibility might be less because they were given insufficient notice. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But some might argue that best friends should always attend weddings regardless. Hmm.\n"
