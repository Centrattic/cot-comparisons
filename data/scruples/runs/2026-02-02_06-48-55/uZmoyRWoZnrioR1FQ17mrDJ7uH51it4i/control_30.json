G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's wedding. The friend didn't send a save-the-date, only the actual invitation a month before the wedding. The author and friends had planned a trip to Australia that starts two days before the wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the timeline. Save-the-dates are usually sent several months in advance, but the friend only sent invitations a month out. That's late, which might have made it hard for the author to adjust plans. The author mentions that the trip started planning a few months ago, and they invited the friend, so maybe the friend was aware of the plans but still scheduled the wedding so close to the trip.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the notice was too short, and the trip is a financial burden they can't afford to cancel. Also, the friend is upset and acting like they should drop everything, but the author points out that only 20 out of 50 invited people can attend because of the short notice. That suggests other people also had issues, so maybe it's not just the author.\n\nI think the key points are the short notice and the fact that the author had a pre-existing plan they couldn't cancel. Friends usually understand if there's a conflict, especially when it's their own fault for not giving enough notice. The author isn't doing something to harm the friend; they're following through with a commitment they made earlier. So the answer is probably B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
