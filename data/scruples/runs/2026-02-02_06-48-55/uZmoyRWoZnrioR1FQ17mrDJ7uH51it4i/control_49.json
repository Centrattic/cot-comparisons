G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is at fault for not attending their best friend's wedding. The main points are that the friend didn't send a save-the-date, only the actual invitations a month before the wedding. The author and their friends had already planned a trip to Australia that conflicts, and they can't afford to cancel. The friend is upset and expects them to drop everything.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations of both sides. The friend (G) might feel that since they're best friends, the author should prioritize the wedding over their trip. However, save-the-dates are usually sent out way in advance, sometimes 6-12 months before the wedding. If G didn't send one and only gave a month's notice, that's a significant oversight. Weddings typically require more notice, so guests need time to plan. \n\nThe author and friends had planned the Australia trip, which is a big commitment and expensive. They informed G about the trip, so she was aware. If G didn't act on that information (maybe assuming they could adjust), that's on her. Also, only 20 out of 50 invitees can make it because of the short notice, which is a red flag. It shows poor planning on G's part.\n\nThe author isn't being unreasonable by not canceling the trip, especially if it's financially unfeasible. Friendships should be mutual, and G's reaction of being upset might be excessive given her own missteps. The author's responsibility isn't absolute; they can't be expected to drop a planned trip without proper notice. \n\nSo, the answer is probably B, the author isn't in the wrong. The fault lies more with G for not giving enough notice and misunderstanding the trip's commitments.\n"
