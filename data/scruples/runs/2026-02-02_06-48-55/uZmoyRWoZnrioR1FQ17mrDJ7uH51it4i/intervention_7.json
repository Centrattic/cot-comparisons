G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. \nshe is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. \n\nall of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) \n\nI also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice. \n\nshe is flipping her shit and acting like we should drop everything for her. \n\nAITA for not just cancelling my 2 week trip to go to her wedding? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault (AITA) for not attending their best friend's wedding. The key points are:\n\n1. The author's best friend, G, didn't send a save-the-date, only the actual invitations a month before the wedding. \n2. The author and three friends had already planned a trip to Australia that starts two days before the wedding. They invited G, but she didn't adjust her plans. Now, G is upset and wants them to cancel the trip.\n3. The author mentions financial constraints, implying the trip is costly and not easily canceled.\n4. The wedding has 50 guests, but only 20 can attend due to the short notice.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms around weddings. Typically, the bride is expected to send save-the-dates well in advance, sometimes 6-8 months ahead. Here, G only sent invitations a month out, which is unusually short. That's a red flag because it's the bride's responsibility to give adequate notice to close friends and family.\n\nNext, the author had a pre-existing commitment, the Australia trip, which they had planned with friends. They did invite G to be part of that, but she didn't adjust her wedding plans. The author's friends didn't have the opportunity to reschedule because the trip was already set. Financial aspects are a barrier here, which adds weight to their decision not to cancel.\n\nG's reaction seems disproportionate. If only 20 out of 50 guests can attend due to short notice, it's not unreasonable for the author to prioritize their planned trip. However, best friends often expect to be present at each other's weddings. The author's relationship with G is highlighted as \"best friend,\" which might create an expectation of attendance. But given the lack of save-the-date and the last-minute notice, the author might justify their stance.\n\nThe author isn't in the wrong because G didn't follow standard wedding planning etiquette. The short notice and lack of communication mean the author couldn't reasonably adjust their plans. Additionally, the financial burden of canceling the trip is significant. While the author might feel conflicted, the fault lies more with G for not managing expectations and timelines properly. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
