And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for expecting their daughter to be good at something. The parent mentions that Ellie, their 15-year-old daughter, isn't into anything, has average grades, and only does passive activities like watching Netflix and being on her phone. They've tried introducing her to various activities but she resists and calls them controlling. The parents feel that Ellie is aimless and want her to excel in something, even if it's not what they did.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. They're concerned about their daughter's lack of engagement and want her to find a passion or skill. Their intention might be to help her develop a sense of purpose, build skills, or avoid future regrets. However, the approach they're taking\u2014pressuring her to be \"good\" at something without her choosing it\u2014could be problematic. \n\nEllie is 15, so she's a teenager, which is a time when autonomy and identity are important. If the parents are pushing her to pursue activities she's not interested in, it might be seen as controlling or dismissive of her preferences. The daughter's reaction of calling them controlling suggests that she feels her autonomy is being invaded. Even if the parents say they're not forcing specific activities, the underlying expectation that she must be good at something might still feel like pressure.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents might argue that they're trying to encourage her to find a passion and avoid a life of inactivity. They're providing opportunities, which isn't inherently bad. But the emphasis on being \"the best\" or \"good\" could be contributing to the problem. The daughter might feel that she's being judged for not excelling, which could lead to anxiety or resistance.\n\nAnother angle is the daughter's perspective. If she's not into anything, maybe she's dealing with other issues like low self-esteem, lack of interest due to school stress, or even undiagnosed mental health challenges like depression. The parents might be missing underlying issues by focusing solely on her activities. \n\nThe key here is balancing parental concern with the child's autonomy. While it's natural for parents to want their children to have interests and skills, imposing expectations without considering the child's feelings and interests can be harmful. The daughter's resistance indicates that the current approach isn't working. The parents might need to step back, have an open conversation with Ellie to understand her perspective, and support her in finding her own path rather than pushing for excellence in something she's not motivated to pursue.\n\nSo, considering all this, the parents' approach might be overbearing, even if their intentions are good. The daughter's feelings of being controlled suggest that the parents are in the wrong. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
