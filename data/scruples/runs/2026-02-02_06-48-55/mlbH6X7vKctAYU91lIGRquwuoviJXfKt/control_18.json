And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for expecting their daughter to be the best at something. The parent mentions Ellie is 15, not into anything, and they want her to excel at something. They've tried introducing various activities but she resists, calling them controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations. The parent wants her to be good at something, but not necessarily a specific activity. They're letting her choose but pushing for her to commit and excel. The daughter is resistant and feels controlled. \n\nIs pushing for excellence in any area reasonable? Well, every parent wants their child to have interests and skills. But the way they're approaching it might be an issue. The parent says they're not forcing a specific activity but still want her to be good at something. However, if the daughter isn't choosing anything, maybe the pressure is causing her to push back. \n\nAlso, at 15, she's in a phase where she might be figuring things out. Maybe the pressure is too much. The parent's reasoning is that doing nothing is not acceptable, but the daughter's response is that they're being controlling. It's a conflict between the parent's concern for her development and the daughter's autonomy.\n\nI should consider if the parent is wrong. If they're not forcing her into a specific activity but still pushing her to find something she's passionate about and excel, maybe they're not entirely wrong. However, the daughter's resistance and the parent's insistence might be infringing on her autonomy. \n\nBut the key point is that the parent isn't choosing the activity for her, just wanting her to choose and be committed. Still, if she's not interested in any of the options they've introduced, maybe they need to step back and let her explore her own interests without pressure. The parent's approach might be too controlling even if they aren't dictating the activity. \n\nSo, the parent might be in the wrong for not respecting the daughter's current lack of interest and pushing too hard. Answer A.\n"
