And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for expecting their daughter to be good at something. The parent mentions that their 15-year-old daughter isn't into anything, has average grades, and just watches Netflix and uses her phone. They want her to be good at something, so they've tried introducing various activities, but she resists and calls them controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's intentions. They want their child to find a passion or strength, which is a common parental desire. However, the approach might be problematic. The parent says they're letting her choose anything as long as she does something and is good at it. But the daughter feels pressured and labels them as controlling. Even if the parents aren't forcing specific activities, the underlying expectation that she must excel in something might be too much. Adolescents often struggle with identity and autonomy, so pushing for excellence in any area could add stress without considering her interests or personality.\n\nAlso, at 15, it's still early for someone to have a clear focus. Some kids take longer to find their path. The parents are concerned about her being \"aimless,\" but maybe that's normal for her age. The key issue is whether the parents are respecting her autonomy versus imposing their own values. The daughter's reaction suggests that she feels the pressure is excessive, which could affect her mental health and self-esteem.\n\nIn terms of fairness, while the parents have good intentions, their approach might not be supportive enough. Encouraging without pressuring is a balance. The answer might lean towards the parents being in the wrong because they're imposing an expectation of excellence without considering her natural inclinations and the importance of intrinsic motivation. So, Answer A (Yes, in the wrong) is likely correct.\n"
