And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for expecting their daughter to be the best at something. The parent mentions that Ellie, their 15-year-old daughter, isn't into anything, has average grades, and just watches TV and uses her phone. They want her to be good at something, so they've tried introducing various activities, but she's resistant and called them controlling. The parent feels they're not being controlling but want her to choose something and excel.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. They're concerned about their daughter's lack of involvement and want her to have hobbies or skills. That's a common parental concern, wanting their kids to be engaged and successful. But the daughter is 15, which is a time when teens start developing their own interests and identity. The parents might be pushing her towards activities that don't align with her passions, leading to conflict.\n\nThe daughter feels controlled, even if the parents are letting her choose the activity. The key here is whether the parents are imposing their expectations without respecting her autonomy. Even if they allow her to pick what she does, if the underlying pressure is that she must be good at something, that could be stressful for the teen. The daughter's interests might not align with the parents' ideas of what counts as \"good,\" and the parents might not be considering that her current lifestyle (watching TV, using phone) is her way of relaxing or coping.\n\nAlso, teens need autonomy to explore and find their own path. The parents' approach might be too focused on achievement rather than support. The question is whether the parents are in the wrong by pressuring Ellie to conform to their standards of being good at something, rather than allowing her to discover her own interests without that pressure. The daughter's reaction of feeling controlled suggests that the parents' methods are causing resentment, which could harm their relationship and the daughter's self-esteem.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents have valid concerns about their daughter's lack of engagement. It's possible they're worried about her future or her ability to cope with challenges. However, the way they're addressing it might not be effective. The line between support and pressure is thin here. The answer likely hinges on whether the parents are forcing Ellie into activities she doesn't genuinely enjoy, leading to a conflict where the daughter feels her autonomy is violated.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer is likely that the parent is in the wrong. They might be imposing their expectations without considering Ellie's individuality and interests, leading to her feeling controlled. So the answer would be A.\n"
