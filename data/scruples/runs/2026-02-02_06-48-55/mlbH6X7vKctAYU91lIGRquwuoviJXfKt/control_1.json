And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for expecting their daughter to excel at something. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the daughter is 15, and the parents are concerned she's not into anything. Her grades are average, and she's not involved in any activities. The parents have tried introducing various options like sports, art, instruments, etc., but she's resistant and even called them controlling. The parents argue they're not forcing specific activities but want her to commit to something and be good at it, as they find her current lack of engagement problematic.\n\nNow, the question is whether the parents are wrong. Let's consider both sides. On one hand, every child is different. Some kids might take longer to find their passion, or maybe they're content without intense hobbies. The parents' approach of pushing her to be \"the best\" or \"good\" at something might create pressure. The daughter's reaction suggests she feels controlled, which could affect her self-esteem and autonomy.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents express concern about her being aimless. They're trying to encourage her to develop skills or hobbies that could benefit her future. Their intention isn't to dictate but to ensure she's engaged. However, the key issue is the expectation that she must be good at something. This can be problematic because it's not always in the child's control. Natural talent varies, and forcing her to pursue something she's not interested in, even if it's framed as \"her choice,\" might not be the healthiest approach.\n\nAlso, the parents mention they're letting her choose anything, but they still expect her to be good at it. That might not be realistic. Some people don't excel in any area, and that's okay. The parents might be projecting their own values or fears onto their daughter. The daughter's resistance indicates she's not comfortable with that pressure, which could harm their relationship.\n\nIn terms of parenting styles, excessive pressure can lead to anxiety or burnout in teens. It's important to support a child's interests without forcing them into a mold. The parents' insistence on her being \"good\" might overshadow her intrinsic motivation. Maybe the focus should be on enjoying activities rather than excelling at them.\n\nIn summary, while the parents have good intentions, their approach might be too prescriptive. They should consider that their daughter's current state might be normal for her, and pushing her could have negative effects. The answer is likely A, as they're in the wrong for imposing their expectations without considering her autonomy and interests.\n"
