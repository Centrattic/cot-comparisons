And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for expecting their daughter to excel at something. The daughter is 15, not involved in anything, and the parents are pushing her to be good at something, which is causing conflict. The parent says they're not forcing specific activities but want her to choose and be good at something. The daughter called them controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' perspective. They're concerned about their daughter's lack of engagement and want her to have interests or skills. That's a common parental concern. But how they're approaching it might be an issue. The parents are introducing her to various activities, but if she's not interested, maybe they're pressuring her too much. The daughter's reaction suggests she feels forced, which could be a problem even if the parents think they're giving her free choice.\n\nThen there's the daughter's age. At 15, she's a teenager, and this is a time when many kids start to form their own identities. Parents wanting their kids to have hobbies or skills is understandable, but the approach matters. If the parents are pushing her without considering her preferences or if they're making her feel like she has to meet certain expectations, that could be problematic. The key here is whether the parents are respecting her autonomy versus having their own expectations.\n\nThe term \"controlling\" from the daughter is significant. Even if the parents think they're being supportive, if the child perceives it as controlling, that's an issue. The parents might not be explicitly forcing activities but the underlying message that she must be good at something could create pressure. Also, expecting her to be \"the best\" or at least \"good\" might be unrealistic or place undue stress on her, especially if she's not finding her passion yet.\n\nAnother angle is the daughter's current activities. Watching Netflix and being on her phone are common for teens, but the parents see it as aimlessness. However, it's possible that the daughter is just exploring her interests at her own pace. Teenagers often go through phases of experimentation, and not having a clear direction yet doesn't necessarily mean she's failing. The parents might be projecting their own values or fears onto her.\n\nI should also consider cultural factors. In some cultures, there's a strong emphasis on children excelling in certain areas, which might be where the parents are coming from. But in other contexts, individual choice is prioritized. The answer might depend on cultural norms, but the question doesn't specify that, so I have to assume a general perspective.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The parents have good intentions but their approach might be overly controlling. They want their daughter to have interests and achievements, which is reasonable, but how they're enforcing it (even if they think they're giving her choice) is causing conflict. The daughter's resistance indicates that she feels her autonomy is being invaded. Therefore, the parents are likely in the wrong because they're imposing their expectations without respecting her current path. The right balance would be encouraging exploration without pressure to excel, allowing her to find her own interests naturally.\n"
