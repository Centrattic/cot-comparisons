And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for expecting their daughter to excel at something. The parent says their 15-year-old daughter, Ellie, isn't into anything, has average grades, and just watches Netflix and uses her phone. They want her to be good at something, so they've introduced her to various activities, but she's not interested and called them controlling. The parent argues they're not forcing specific choices but want her to choose something and be good at it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the parent's expectations are reasonable. At 15, many teens explore different interests. It's normal to go through phases of not feeling strongly about anything yet. The parents are pushing for her to be \"the best\" or at least good, which might be high pressure. They say they're not dictating what she should do, but the underlying message seems to be that she must choose something and excel. The key here is the pressure to be good at something versus allowing her to find her own path.\n\nNext, the daughter's perspective. She feels her parents are controlling, even if the parents think they're not. The fact that she's resisting might indicate that the pressure is coming through, even if it's not overt. Teens can sense expectations and might push back if they feel forced. The parents might not realize that their insistence on her being good at something could be stifling her autonomy, which is important during adolescence.\n\nAlso, the parents are concerned about her being aimless. However, not all kids are driven to excel in extracurriculars. Some might have different passions or may take longer to find their interests. The parents might be projecting their own values or desires onto their daughter. It's possible that their expectations are more about their own aspirations than what's best for the child.\n\nAnother angle is the approach the parents are taking. Introducing her to many activities might overwhelm her or make her feel like she's being pressured to try everything without the freedom to just explore without pressure. The phrasing \"as long as she does something and is good at it\" implies that doing nothing is unacceptable, which could be a problem. Maybe the parents should focus on supporting her in whatever she's interested in, even if it's not something they consider \"good\" or prestigious.\n\nIn terms of parenting advice, it's often recommended to encourage but not force. Allowing the child to pursue her own interests without the pressure to excel might help her develop intrinsic motivation. The parents might need to balance their concerns with respecting their daughter's autonomy and recognizing that her interests might not align with what the parents consider valuable.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the parents might be in the wrong because their expectations could be too rigid and pressure-filled, even if they think they're encouraging. The daughter's reaction suggests that she feels controlled, which indicates the parents' approach might not be effective or considerate of her individuality.\n"
