And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their daughter to be good at something. The daughter, Ellie, is 15 and isn't involved in anything except watching TV and using her phone. The parents are trying to push her towards some activity where she can excel.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' reasoning. They want her to have a hobby or something she's good at, which is a common concern for many parents. They mention they've introduced her to various activities but she's not interested. She even called them controlling. The parents say they aren't forcing a specific activity, just that she needs to do something and be good at it.\n\nNow, the key points here are about parental expectations and the child's autonomy. Expecting a teenager to have interests and pursue them is reasonable, but the approach matters. The parents might be overstepping if they're pressuring her without respecting her preferences. The daughter feels controlled, which suggests the parents' approach might be too pushy even if they're not dictating specifics. \n\nAlso, the parents are upset that she's \"aimless,\" but adolescence is a time when many teens explore their interests. It's normal for some teens to not have clear hobbies yet. The parents' insistence that she must be \"good at something\" could be setting unrealistic expectations. The daughter's resistance might be a reaction to the pressure rather than a lack of interest. \n\nSo, while the parents have good intentions, their approach may not respect Ellie's autonomy and could be contributing to her disinterest. The answer likely leans towards the parents being in the wrong (A) because they're imposing expectations that might not align with the daughter's needs and interests, leading to conflict and resistance.\n"
