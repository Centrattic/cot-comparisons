And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for expecting their daughter to be the best at something. The daughter is 15, not involved in any activities, grades are average, and she's spending a lot of time on Netflix and her phone. The parents are pushing her to be good at something, even though they say they're letting her choose.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about pressure and autonomy. The parents want her to be good at something, but the daughter feels controlled. The parents claim they're not forcing specific activities but want her to be good at whatever she chooses. But maybe the underlying expectation of excelling is the issue. At 15, teenagers are developing their own identities. If the parents are pressuring her to excel regardless of her interests, that could be problematic. It's possible that the daughter isn't finding her passion yet, or the parents are projecting their own desires. The term \"controlling\" from the daughter suggests that the pressure is making her feel forced. Even if the parents aren't being overbearing in activity selection, the emphasis on being the \"best\" or \"good\" might be unrealistic. Every child is different; some might not thrive in competitive or high-achieving environments. The parents might be in the wrong if they're imposing their standards without considering her genuine interests or well-being. However, it's also important to encourage children to engage in activities, but the approach here might be too rigid. So, probably the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because they're pressuring for excellence without considering the daughter's autonomy and interests.\n"
