And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for expecting their 15-year-old daughter to excel at something. The parent is frustrated because the daughter isn't into anything, her grades are average, and she's not involved in any activities. They've tried introducing various options but the daughter resists and calls them controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. They want their child to have a hobby or skill, which is common. Parents often want their kids to develop interests and strengths. However, the key issue here is how they're approaching it. The parent mentions they let the daughter choose what she wants to do, as long as she's good at something. The daughter feels pressured and controlled, even though the parents argue they're not being specific about what she should do.\n\nFrom a psychological standpoint, adolescence is a time for self-discovery. Forcing or pressuring a teenager can lead to resistance and a sense of autonomy being threatened. The daughter's reaction (\"controlling\") suggests she feels her independence is being invaded. Even if the parents aren't dictating the exact activity, the underlying message that she must be good at *something* might still feel like pressure. \n\nAlso, the daughter's current behavior\u2014watching TV and being on her phone\u2014might be her way of coping or expressing disinterest. The parents might not be considering that she's going through a phase or lacks motivation for reasons beyond their understanding. Forcing her to engage in activities she's not interested in could backfire, leading to resentment or burnout.\n\nOn the other hand, it's natural for parents to want their children to have skills or interests. But the line between support and pressure is thin. The parents might be projecting their own desires or fears onto the daughter. Maybe they want her to have a structured life, but the daughter's autonomy is a critical factor here.\n\nSo, the question is whether expecting a teenager to excel in something is inherently wrong. The parents aren't forcing a specific path, but their insistence on her being \"the best\" or \"good at something\" could be harmful. It's possible that the daughter is introverted, not yet found her passion, or is dealing with other issues like anxiety or low self-esteem. The parents might be missing the mark by not validating her current state and instead pushing for external validation through achievements.\n\nIn conclusion, while the parents' intentions might be good, their approach could be seen as controlling because it pressures the daughter to conform to their expectations of what a successful or engaged teenager should be. The daughter's feelings of being controlled are valid, even if the parents don't see themselves that way. Therefore, the parents might be in the wrong by not respecting her autonomy and current phase in life.\n"
