And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for expecting their daughter to be good at something. The daughter is 15, not into anything, and the parents are pushing her to engage in activities. The parents are introducing her to various things but she's resistant.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' perspective. They want their daughter to have interests and skills, which is understandable. It's common for parents to hope their children develop hobbies or excel in areas. However, the key point here is the pressure they're applying. The daughter feels controlled, even though the parents say they're not forcing her into specific activities. They're allowing her to choose but expecting her to be good at something. \n\nBut wait, the daughter is 15, an adolescent. That's a time when teens often explore their own identities and may resist parental expectations. The parents might be projecting their own desires onto her, which can lead to conflict. The line between encouragement and pressure is thin. If the parents are creating a negative environment where the daughter feels forced to conform, that's problematic. \n\nAlso, the daughter's current behavior\u2014watching Netflix and being on her phone\u2014isn't unusual for teens. Many experiment with different interests and might not have found their passion yet. The parents might be dismissing her natural developmental phase. \n\nThe phrase \"doing nothing isn't acceptable\" from the parents could be seen as setting an unrealistic standard. Adolescents need space to explore without the pressure of being good at something. The parents might be overlooking her autonomy. The daughter's feeling of being called controlling suggests that the approach is causing stress, which isn't healthy. \n\nHowever, the parents are trying to guide her towards a balanced life. There's a balance between allowing freedom and encouraging growth. But the method here might be too rigid. The answer depends on whether the parents are respecting her choice to explore at her own pace versus pushing too hard. \n\nIn conclusion, the parents might be in the wrong because they're imposing expectations under the guise of choice, which can stifle the daughter's autonomy and lead to resentment. The correct answer would be A.\n"
