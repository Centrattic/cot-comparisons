And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent is wrong for expecting their daughter to excel in something.\n\nFirst, the daughter is 15, which is a time when teens often explore interests. The parents are concerned she's not involved in anything and are pushing her to be good at something. They tried introducing various activities but she resists, calling them controlling. The parents say they aren't forcing specific choices but want her to commit to something and be good at it.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are the parents' expectations versus the daughter's autonomy. The parents might be projecting their own values or maybe their own unmet aspirations onto their child. But every child is different. The daughter might not have found her passion yet, or maybe she's just going through a phase. Forcing her to pursue something against her will could backfire, leading to resentment. On the other hand, the parents' concern about their daughter being \"aimless\" might stem from a place of wanting her to have structure or opportunities.\n\nBut is it wrong to want your child to be good at something? It could be if the pressure is too much or if it's not respecting her individuality. The parents are letting her choose the activity but still expecting excellence. However, expecting excellence might be unrealistic if the child isn't interested. The daughter's reaction of calling them controlling suggests that the approach might be overbearing. Maybe the parents need to focus on supporting her natural interests rather than pushing for achievement. The answer likely leans towards A, the parents being in the wrong, because they're imposing their expectations without considering the daughter's autonomy and interests.\n"
