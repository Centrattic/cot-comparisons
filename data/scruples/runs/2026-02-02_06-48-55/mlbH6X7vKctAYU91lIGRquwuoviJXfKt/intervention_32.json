And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. Let me read through the scenario again to make sure I understand it correctly.\n\nThe author and their husband are concerned that their 15-year-old daughter, Ellie, isn't into anything. She has average grades, doesn't participate in any activities, and just watches Netflix and uses her phone. The parents want her to be good at something, even if it's not what they were into. They've tried introducing various activities but Ellie resists and calls them controlling. The parents argue they're not forcing specific choices but want her to commit to something and be good at it. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the dynamics here. The parents are pushing for their daughter to find an interest and excel in it, which they see as important for her future. However, Ellie is in her teenage years, a time when identity and autonomy are developing. Pushing for her to excel in something might conflict with her current lack of interest and desire for independence.\n\nThe parents mention they're not forcing her to choose the same activities they were into, which is a good point. But the key issue here is that they want her to be \"good at something,\" even if she's not interested. The pressure to perform or excel in an activity can be stressful for a teenager, especially if they don't feel a genuine connection to it. \n\nEllie's reaction of feeling controlled suggests that she perceives the parents' actions as overbearing. Even if the parents are giving her options, the underlying message might be that she must succeed in something, which could lead to resentment. At 15, teenagers often struggle with finding their own path, and parental pressure might hinder that process.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents have valid concerns. They want their daughter to have direction and skills, which can contribute to her future. However, the approach might be the problem. Instead of trying to push her into structured activities, maybe the focus should be on supporting her in exploring her own interests without the pressure to be the best. It's possible Ellie is going through a phase of uncertainty, and the parents' insistence on achievement could be causing friction.\n\nI should also consider if there's any other context missing, like Ellie's personality or any external factors affecting her engagement. But based on the information given, the parents' expectations might be unrealistic. It's important for teens to have autonomy in choosing their activities, and the emphasis on being \"the best\" could be counterproductive. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong because they're imposing pressure on their daughter to excel in something without respecting her current lack of interest and autonomy. The key is balancing guidance with allowing the teenager to explore on her own terms.\n"
