And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for expecting their daughter to excel at something. The parent's argument is that their daughter isn't into anything, just watches Netflix and uses her phone, so they want her to be good at something, even if the specific activity doesn't matter. They've tried introducing various options, but the daughter thinks they're controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. They might feel that their daughter isn't developing any skills or interests, which could affect her future or self-esteem. They want to push her to find something she's good at, but the daughter resists and labels them as controlling. The parent claims they're not forcing a specific activity, just wanting her to choose something and commit to it.\n\nOn the other hand, from the daughter's side, being 15, she's in a stage where she's figuring out her own interests. Parents pushing her to be \"the best\" might be putting pressure on her, which could be counterproductive. The daughter feeling controlled suggests that the parent's approach might be too forceful, even if the intention is good. The parent's insistence on her being good at something might not account for the daughter's natural inclinations or burnout from trying too many things.\n\nThe key issue here is the balance between parental guidance and the child's autonomy. Parents have a responsibility to encourage their children, but expecting excellence in something without considering the child's own passions and pace can be problematic. The parent might not be in the wrong entirely, but their approach could be seen as overbearing. The daughter's resistance is a sign that the method is causing conflict.\n\nSo, is the parent in the wrong? The parent's desire for their daughter to have interests and skills is understandable, but the way they're approaching it by pressuring her to be \"the best\" and making it a requirement could be too much. The daughter's reaction indicates that the pressure is affecting their relationship. Therefore, the parent might be in the wrong for not respecting the daughter's autonomy and for imposing expectations that don't align with her current interests or readiness.\n"
