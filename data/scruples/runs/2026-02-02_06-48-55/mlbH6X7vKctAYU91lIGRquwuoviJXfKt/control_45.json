And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for expecting their 15-year-old daughter to excel at something. The parent mentions that Ellie isn't into anything, has average grades, and spends a lot of time on Netflix and her phone. They've tried introducing her to various activities but she resists, calling them controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the parent's perspective. They want Ellie to have a hobby or skill where she's good, not necessarily pushing her into specific ones. They're letting her choose but expect her to commit to something. The key here is whether the parents are being overbearing or if their expectations are reasonable.\n\nOn the other hand, the daughter is a teenager, a time when many kids experiment with interests. It's normal for some teens to not have found their passion yet. The parents are trying to encourage extracurricular activities, which is common, but the pressure to be \"the best\" or \"good\" might be the issue. The daughter feels controlled, which suggests that the approach might be too forceful despite the parents' claims of not being controlling.\n\nThe parents' reasoning is that doing nothing isn't acceptable, but they might be overlooking Ellie's autonomy. Teenagers need space to explore without pressure from parents. Pushing for excellence might not be realistic if Ellie isn't interested. The term \"controlling\" from the daughter's side is significant here. Even if the parents think they're giving choices, the pressure to perform well in something could be causing stress.\n\nIn terms of societal or psychological perspectives, allowing a teenager to self-determine their interests is important for their development. Encouragement is good, but forcing or pressuring might backfire. The parents might not be wrong in wanting their child to have interests, but their method of ensuring she does might be problematic. The line between support and control is thin here.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer might lean towards the parents being in the wrong (A) because their approach, while well-intentioned, could be seen as controlling and not respecting the daughter's autonomy. However, there's a balance. The parents aren't forcing a specific activity, but their insistence on her being good at something might be the issue. The daughter's reaction indicates that the parents' expectations are causing tension. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
