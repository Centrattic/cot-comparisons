And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" situation is in the wrong. The parents are concerned that their 15-year-old daughter, Ellie, isn't into anything. She's average in school and spends a lot of time on her phone and watching Netflix. The parents want her to be good at something, whether it's sports, art, music, etc., and they've tried introducing her to various activities. Ellie feels controlled, but the parents insist they're not forcing specific things on her, just expecting her to choose something.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The parents' perspective is that they want their daughter to have interests and not be aimless. They might be worried about her future, social development, or self-esteem. They mention introducing her to various activities, which shows they're trying to help her find something she likes. However, they're pushing for her to be \"good at something,\" which could imply pressure even if they aren't forcing specific choices.\n\nOn Ellie's side, she's 15, which is a time when teenagers often start to form their own identities. Feeling controlled by her parents might be causing her to resist. She's not doing anything because maybe she hasn't found something that interests her, or perhaps she's struggling with motivation, anxiety, or other issues. The parents' insistence on her being good at something could be adding stress, making her more disengaged.\n\nNow, considering whether the parents are in the wrong. The key points are their expectations versus Ellie's autonomy. The parents are allowing her to choose, but they're setting a condition that whatever she chooses, she must excel at it. That might not be realistic. Everyone has different strengths and interests, and expecting a teenager to be \"the best\" or at least \"good\" at something could be placing undue pressure. Also, the fact that Ellie is called controlling by her daughter suggests that the parents' approach might not be as supportive as they think. Even if they're not forcing her into specific activities, the underlying pressure to perform well could be stifling her natural exploration.\n\nAdditionally, at 15, Ellie might still be figuring out what she likes. It's possible she hasn't found her passion yet, and the parents' insistence on her being good at something might be counterproductive, leading to resistance instead of engagement. The parents' frustration is understandable, but their approach might not be the right way to encourage their daughter. They might need to focus on creating an environment where Ellie feels supported in exploring without the pressure of being the best. Maybe they should talk to her about her feelings, understand her lack of interest, and help her find activities she genuinely enjoys rather than pushing for excellence in something arbitrary.\n\nIn summary, while the parents have good intentions, their approach might be too rigid and pressure-filled, which could be why the daughter is reacting negatively. The answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because the parents are imposing expectations that might not align with their daughter's needs and autonomy, even if they're not forcing specific activities.\n"
