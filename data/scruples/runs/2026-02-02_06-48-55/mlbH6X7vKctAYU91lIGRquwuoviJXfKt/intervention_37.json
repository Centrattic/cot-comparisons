And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The parent is asking if it's their fault (AITA) for pushing their 15-year-old daughter to excel in something. The daughter isn't into anything and spends time on Netflix and her phone. The parents have tried introducing various activities but she resists, calling them controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' intentions. They want Ellie to be good at something, whether it's sports, arts, or academics. They mention they're not forcing specific activities but want her to choose something and be good at it. But the daughter feels pressured despite the parents' insistence that they're not controlling.\n\nThe key issue here is the pressure to excel. At 15, teenagers are often exploring their interests. Forcing or even strongly encouraging excellence in any area might be counterproductive if the child isn't interested. The parents might be projecting their own values onto Ellie, expecting her to have achievements similar to their own, which isn't necessarily fair. Also, the daughter feels controlled, which suggests the approach is causing tension.\n\nAverage grades and lack of extracurriculars don't automatically mean a problem. Maybe Ellie is content with her current path, and the parents are worried about her future. However, pushing for excellence without considering her interests could harm her self-esteem or lead to burnout. The fact that they're introducing her to lots of different activities might overwhelm her instead of letting her find her own passions.\n\nOn the other hand, parents often want their children to have direction. But the method here seems to lack support for her interests and may impose their expectations. The parents might not be in the wrong entirely, but their approach could be the issue. They need to balance encouragement with respecting Ellie's autonomy.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether pressuring for excellence without considering the child's interests is wrong. Since the daughter is resistant and the parents aren't allowing her to choose without the pressure to be good, the parents are likely in the wrong. The answer would be A.\n"
