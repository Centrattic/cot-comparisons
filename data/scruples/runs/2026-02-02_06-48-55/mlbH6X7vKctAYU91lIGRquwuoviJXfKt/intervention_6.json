And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the parent is in the wrong for expecting their daughter to be good at something. The parent mentions that their 15-year-old daughter isn't into anything, has average grades, and spends most of her time on social media and Netflix. They're trying to get her involved in various activities but she's pushing back, calling them controlling. The parent's reasoning is that they just want her to be good at something, even if the specific activity doesn't matter.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. They're concerned about their daughter's lack of direction and want her to have interests or skills. That's a common parental concern, especially as teenagers approach adulthood. They might feel it's important for her future that she has some passions or strengths. However, the way they're approaching it might be an issue. The daughter feels pressured, even if the parents are presenting options. The parent says they're letting her choose, but the underlying expectation is that she must excel in something. That could be conflicting.\n\nNow, the daughter is 15, which is a time when teens often explore different activities and sometimes take time to find their interests. It might not be unusual for her to not have found her niche yet. The parents are pushing her to find something, but if the daughter feels forced, it might lead to resistance. The key here is whether the parents are respecting her autonomy. Even if they're presenting options, if the message is \"you must do something and be good at it,\" that could be seen as controlling, regardless of their intentions.\n\nAlso, considering the daughter's reaction of calling them controlling, there's a perception of pressure. Even if the parents don't mean to be, the way they're enforcing the expectation might come across as such. The daughter's right to explore without pressure is important. Maybe the parents are overstepping by expecting her to excel in something specific, rather than allowing her to explore without the pressure of being good at it. \n\nAnother angle is the definition of \"being the best.\" The parents might not mean the literal best but just competent or skilled. However, the daughter might perceive it as needing to achieve a high level in a short time, which could be stressful. The parent's approach might not account for the fact that some people take longer to develop interests or might not pursue traditional paths. \n\nIn terms of societal expectations, there's a push for children to have extracurricular activities and achievements, but it's important to balance that with the child's own interests and well-being. If the daughter is not showing interest in any of the activities they've tried, maybe they need to consider other approaches, like allowing her more time to explore at her own pace, or supporting her in areas she does show minimal interest in instead of pushing a variety of options.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the parents might be in the wrong because they're imposing an expectation of excellence without respecting the daughter's autonomy and current phase in life. The daughter's reaction is valid if she feels controlled, and the parent's approach could be counterproductive by creating resistance instead of fostering genuine interest.\n"
