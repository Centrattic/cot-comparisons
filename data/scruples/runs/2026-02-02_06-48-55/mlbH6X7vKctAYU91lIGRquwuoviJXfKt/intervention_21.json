And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is a parent concerned about their 15-year-old daughter not being into anything. They mention that Ellie isn't involved in any activities, has average grades, and spends a lot of time on her phone and Netflix. The parents want her to be good at something, and they've tried introducing various activities but she's resistant, even calling them controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider whether the parents are in the wrong here. The parent's intention is to encourage their daughter to find a passion or hobby, which is a common parental concern. However, the approach they take is important. They say they're letting her choose whatever she wants as long as she does something and is good at it. But the daughter feels controlled, which is a red flag. \n\nThe key issue here is autonomy. At 15, teenagers are developing their own identities and may resist pressure, even if it's well-intentioned. The parents might be imposing their expectations without considering Ellie's preferences or stress levels. It's possible that the daughter feels forced to comply with their idea of what's \"good,\" rather than finding something she genuinely enjoys. \n\nAlso, the parents mention that doing nothing isn't acceptable. While it's reasonable for parents to want their child to be engaged, the pressure to be \"good at something\" could be counterproductive. It might lead to stress, burnout, or a resentment towards activities. The daughter's reaction of calling them controlling suggests she feels pressured, which could damage the parent-child relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents are trying to guide their child towards a more active and potentially successful path. They aren't dictating specific activities but are encouraging her to explore. However, the line between encouragement and pressure can be thin. If Ellie is not responding to the activities introduced, maybe the approach needs to change. Perhaps giving her more space to explore her interests on her own terms, rather than pushing her to excel in something specific, would be better.\n\nAnother angle is the daughter's age. At 15, she might not have found her passion yet, and that's normal. Expecting her to be the best at something might be unrealistic. Parents should balance support with allowing their child to develop at her own pace. The parents' frustration is understandable, but their method might be infringing on Ellie's autonomy.\n\nIn conclusion, while the parents have good intentions, their approach might be too controlling, which could be why the daughter is resistant. They might not be in the wrong entirely, but there's definitely room for them to adjust their strategy to respect Ellie's autonomy and let her discover her interests without pressure.\n"
