And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation. The parent is upset that their 15-year-old daughter, Ellie, isn't into anything. She's average in school and spends a lot of time on her phone and watching TV. The parents want her to be good at something, so they've tried introducing her to various activities. But Ellie thinks they're being controlling, even though the parents say they're not forcing her to do anything specific. The question is, are the parents wrong for expecting their daughter to excel at something?\n\nFirst, I should consider the parents' perspective. They might be worried about their daughter not having direction or interests, which could affect her future. They're trying to encourage her to participate in activities to find something she's good at. But they might be coming off as pushy because she feels pressured even though they claim they're not. \n\nThen there's Ellie's side. At 15, she's in a stage where she's developing her identity. If she's not interested in the activities they're offering, maybe they're not the right fit for her. The fact that she's called them controlling suggests she feels pressured, even if the parents think they're giving her freedom. It's possible the parents are imposing their own expectations without considering her preferences.\n\nThe key points here are the parents' approach and Ellie's response. The parents are trying to encourage engagement but might be overstepping by expecting her to be \"the best\" at something. Their focus on being good at something might be creating pressure instead of supporting her natural interests. It's important to respect her autonomy and let her explore her own interests without judgment. \n\nAlso, expecting someone to be the best at something might be unrealistic. Everyone has different strengths and passions, and not everyone will excel in a traditional sense. The parents might be projecting their own desires onto Ellie. The fact that Ellie is not into anything could be due to her personality or other factors not considered by the parents. \n\nIn terms of parenting, it's crucial to foster a child's intrinsic motivation rather than extrinsic pressures. If Ellie isn't interested, forcing or expecting excellence in an activity could lead to resentment or burnout. The parents need to support her in finding her own path, even if it's not what they expect. So, the author might be in the wrong if their approach is causing stress and not respecting Ellie's autonomy, even if their intentions are good.\n"
