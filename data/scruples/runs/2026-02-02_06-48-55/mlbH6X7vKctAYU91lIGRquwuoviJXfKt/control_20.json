And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for expecting their daughter to be good at something.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The parent mentions their 15-year-old daughter, Ellie, isn't into anything. She's average in school and spends a lot of time on her phone and Netflix. The parents want her to be good at something, trying to introduce her to various activities, but she resists and calls them controlling. The parents feel they're not being controlling but just want her to have a hobby or skill.\n\nSo, the key points here are the parents' expectations versus the daughter's autonomy. Do parents have the right to push their kids to excel in something? Well, every child is different. Some kids naturally find passions, others take longer. At 15, it's not too late, but forcing her might backfire. The parents are letting her choose, but they still have an unspoken requirement that she must be good at it. That part could be problematic. Maybe they're not forcing a specific activity, but the pressure to be good might make her feel controlled. The daughter's reaction of calling them controlling suggests she feels pressured even if they're not being explicit. \n\nAlso, the parents are comparing her to other kids who have activities. But everyone's path is different. Maybe Ellie isn't into traditional hobbies. What if she's into something the parents haven't considered? They might be limiting her options. The parents might be projecting their own values or fears onto her. They might worry about her future without skills, but pushing too hard could damage her self-esteem or create resistance. \n\nOn the other hand, the parents are concerned about her lack of direction. It's natural for parents to want their children to have skills and interests. But the approach matters. The daughter's resistance indicates that the method might be too heavy-handed, even if it's not overtly controlling. The parents might need to give her more space to explore her own interests without the pressure of being \"good at something.\" Maybe the focus should be on finding something she genuinely enjoys, not on excelling. \n\nSo, the answer here might be that the parents are in the wrong (A) because their expectations are imposing pressure, even if well-intentioned. They need to respect her autonomy and let her find her own path without the pressure to be the best. The key issue is the unspoken condition that whatever she chooses, she must be good at it, which could be stifling her natural interests.\n"
