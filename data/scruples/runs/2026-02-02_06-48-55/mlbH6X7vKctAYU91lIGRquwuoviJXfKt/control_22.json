And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a parent expecting their 15-year-old daughter to be good at something. The parents are pushing her to get involved in activities but she's resistant. The parents don't want her to just watch Netflix and be on her phone all the time. They tried introducing her to various things but she's calling them controlling.\n\nHmm, so first, I need to figure out whether the parents are right to expect this. On one hand, they want their daughter to have interests and not be aimless. That's a common concern for parents, wanting their kids to be engaged and developing skills. But on the other hand, the daughter is a teenager, which is a time when kids often push back against parental expectations. The parents say they're not forcing her to choose specific activities, but they do want her to be good at \"something\" regardless. The problem is that their approach might be too broad or imposing, even if they're not dictating the specific activity.\n\nThe daughter feels controlled because her parents are pushing her to be good at something. Even if the parents are allowing her to choose the activity, the pressure to be \"good at something\" might still be a form of control. Teenagers often need autonomy, and the parents' insistence that she must be involved in something might be coming across as controlling, even if their intention is good.\n\nAlso, the parents might not be considering that their daughter's current interests (like watching TV and using her phone) are valid, especially given her age. Many teens spend time on social media or streaming services as a way to relax. The parents' disapproval of these activities could be part of the issue. It's possible that the daughter isn't into any of the activities they've introduced because they don't align with her genuine interests, leading to resistance.\n\nAnother angle: the parents are emphasizing being the \"best\" or at least good at something. This might place undue pressure on the daughter. Not every teen is going to excel in an activity, and the parents might be setting unrealistic expectations. The focus on achievement could be counterproductive, making the daughter less likely to engage in any activity if she feels she has to be exceptional.\n\nBut then again, the parents are trying to guide their child towards a balanced lifestyle. However, the way they're approaching it\u2014introducing her to everything and insisting she choose something\u2014might be overwhelming or feel like an ultimatum. The daughter's calling them controlling suggests that their approach is causing tension and possibly damaging the parent-child relationship.\n\nI think the key points here are the pressure to excel in something, the lack of genuine interest from the daughter, and the perception of control. Even if the parents are not directly forcing her into a specific activity, the underlying expectation that she must be good at something is a form of control. So, the answer would lean towards the parents being in the wrong (A) because their approach is imposing their values on their daughter's interests and autonomy, even if their intentions are good. They might need to respect her current phase and find a different way to encourage engagement without pressure.\n"
