And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for expecting their daughter to be good at something. The parent says their daughter, Ellie, is 15 and not into anything\u2014average grades, doesn't do much at home, and isn't involved in any activities. They want her to be good at something, so they've tried introducing her to various things like sports, art, instruments, etc., but she resists and calls them controlling. The parent argues they're not forcing specific interests but want her to commit to something and excel.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. Their concern is that Ellie is aimless, relying on TV and her phone, and they want her to have hobbies or skills. They're trying to expose her to different options, which seems like they care about her future. However, they might be imposing their expectations without considering Ellie's feelings or interests.\n\nThen there's Ellie's side. At 15, she might be going through puberty, dealing with high school pressures, or just not having found her passion yet. The fact that she's calling her parents \"controlling\" suggests she feels pressured. The parent says they're not forcing specific activities but want her to choose something and be good at it. But is that realistic? Maybe Ellie isn't interested in any of the options they're suggesting, or maybe she's not ready to commit yet.\n\nI should think about child development. Adolescents often experiment with interests and identities. Pushing a teenager to excel might create stress or resentment. The parents might be projecting their own values onto Ellie, expecting her to follow a certain path without understanding her individuality. Also, the phrase \"as long as she does something and is good at it\" could be problematic if it's not her choice. Even if the parents aren't forcing a specific activity, the pressure to perform might still be there.\n\nAnother angle: the parents are trying to help her develop skills, but if Ellie isn't engaged, that approach might backfire. It's possible she's not interested in the areas the parents suggested, or she needs more support or encouragement. The parents might not be considering that Ellie's lack of interest could be due to factors like anxiety, lack of confidence, or simply not having found her passion yet.\n\nAlso, the mention that Ellie isn't involved inside or outside school is notable. Maybe she's not finding opportunities that resonate with her. The parents are trying to introduce her to various options, but maybe they're not giving her enough autonomy to explore on her own terms. Or perhaps they're not listening to her reasons for not wanting to participate.\n\nIn terms of parenting styles, the parents might be in a permissive or authoritarian style, but here they claim to be letting her choose. However, the underlying message is that there's an expectation to excel, which could be conflicting. The line between encouragement and pressure is thin here. The parents want her to be good, but if Ellie isn't interested in any of the offered activities, the pressure to be good becomes a problem.\n\nI should also consider cultural factors. In some cultures, there's a strong emphasis on children excelling in certain areas, and parents might push for that. But in others, individual choice and personal interests are prioritized. The parents might be coming from a place of wanting their child to have opportunities, but their approach might not be appropriate for Ellie's personality.\n\nAnother point: the parents are concerned about her using her phone and watching TV, which they see as a problem. However, maybe those are her coping mechanisms or how she relaxes. If they're not providing alternatives that she actually enjoys, she might default to those activities. It's possible the parents are not yet aware of what Ellie genuinely likes, so their attempts are misaligned with her interests.\n\nIn conclusion, the parents' intentions might be good\u2014they want their daughter to have skills and not be aimless. However, their approach might be too directive or not respecting Ellie's autonomy. The key issue is whether they're respecting her choices versus their expectations. If they're pressuring her to excel in something without her interest, that could be problematic. So, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong (A), but I need to check if there's a middle ground where both parties have valid points. However, based on the scenario, the parents are pushing for excellence in any area, which might not consider Ellie's personal interests and could be seen as controlling, hence the answer could be A.\n"
