And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The parent is asking if they're in the wrong for expecting their 15-year-old daughter to be good at something. The daughter isn't into anything, just watches Netflix and uses her phone. The parents have tried introducing various activities but she resists and calls them controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' intentions. They want their daughter to have hobbies or extracurriculars, which is common. But the daughter feels pressured. The parents say they're not forcing her to do specific things, just that she needs to find something and be good at it. But the daughter is rejecting these options and feels controlled. \n\nIs it wrong to expect a teenager to engage in activities? Some might say it's reasonable for parents to encourage their kids to explore interests. However, the daughter is 15, an age where autonomy is important. The parents are pushing her to be \"the best\" or at least good, which might be too much pressure. They might be imposing their own expectations without considering her preferences or stress levels. \n\nAlso, the daughter's lack of interest could be due to various factors like anxiety, low motivation, or not having found her passion yet. The parents are introducing a lot of options, but maybe they need to give her space to explore on her own terms. Pressuring her might lead to resentment, as she already feels controlled. \n\nOn the other hand, the parents are concerned about her being \"aimless\" and having no hobbies besides TV and phone. It's a balance between encouraging engagement and respecting her autonomy. The line between support and control can be blurry here. If the parents are not forcing specific activities but just pushing for any engagement, maybe they're overstepping. The daughter's reaction suggests she feels coerced, which might mean the parents are in the wrong. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer might lean towards the parents being in the wrong because they're imposing expectations without respecting her current feelings and autonomy, even if their intentions are good.\n"
