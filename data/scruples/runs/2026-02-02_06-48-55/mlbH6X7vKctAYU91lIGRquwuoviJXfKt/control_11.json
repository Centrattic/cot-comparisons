And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for expecting their daughter to be good at something. The parent mentions that Ellie isn't into anything, has average grades, and just watches Netflix and uses her phone. They've tried introducing various activities but she resists and calls them controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the parents' expectations are reasonable. The key point here is that the parents aren't forcing a specific activity but want her to choose something and excel in it. But they're pressuring her by introducing many options, which she perceives as controlling. \n\nEllie is 15, an age where teens often explore their interests. Maybe the parents are right in wanting her to have hobbies, but their approach might be too pushy. The problem is that they're presenting multiple opportunities, which could overwhelm her instead of letting her discover her own interests at her own pace. \n\nAlso, the parents' reasoning that doing nothing is unacceptable might not consider Ellie's personality. Some people thrive in different areas, and not everyone excels in traditional extracurriculars. The pressure to be \"good at something\" could be harmful if it leads to stress or resentment. \n\nOn the other hand, encouraging involvement can be positive. But the line between support and pressure is thin here. The parents might not be in the wrong entirely, but their approach might need adjustment. However, the daughter's reaction suggests that the pressure is causing conflict. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the parents' methods are appropriate. If they're forcing or pushing too much without respecting Ellie's autonomy, they could be in the wrong. The fact that she's called them controlling indicates that their approach isn't working and might be detrimental. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
