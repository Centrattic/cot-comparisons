And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a parent who's upset that their 15-year-old daughter isn't into anything\u2014no hobbies, no extracurriculars, just watching TV and on her phone. The parents want her to be good at something, so they've tried introducing her to various activities. The daughter feels controlled, but the parents argue they're letting her choose as long as she does something.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' perspective. They might be worried about their daughter's future, wanting her to develop skills, interests, or a sense of purpose. Their actions could stem from a place of concern, hoping to push her to find something she's passionate about. But is it okay to push a teenager like that?\n\nOn the other hand, the daughter is 15, which is a time when teens often start asserting their independence. Feeling forced into activities she's not interested in might make her resent the parents. The daughter called them controlling, which could indicate that the parents' approach is too heavy-handed, even if their intention is good. The parents say they're not imposing specific choices but still expecting her to excel in whatever she picks. That pressure might be stifling her autonomy.\n\nI should think about typical teenage development. At 15, kids are figuring out their identities. Pressuring them to be \"good at something\" might not account for their natural exploration phase. It's possible the daughter hasn't found her passion yet, and the parents' constant pushing could be counterproductive.\n\nAlso, the parents are trying multiple avenues but the daughter isn't engaging. Maybe the problem isn't the daughter not trying, but the parents not allowing her to find her own path without pressure. The key issue here is the balance between encouraging a child to explore and respecting their autonomy. The parents might be overstepping by not accepting that their daughter is in a phase where she's not interested in structured activities yet.\n\nSo, while the parents' intentions are good, their approach might be the problem. They might be in the wrong for not respecting their daughter's current phase and instead imposing expectations that could be causing conflict. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
