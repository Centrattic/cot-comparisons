And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for expecting their daughter to be good at something. The parent mentions their 15-year-old daughter, Ellie, isn't into anything, has average grades, and spends time on Netflix and her phone. They tried introducing various activities but she resists, calling them controlling. The parents want her to be good at something, any something, but she's not choosing anything.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's intent. They want Ellie to have interests and skills, which is a common parental desire. But their approach might be problematic. They say they're letting her choose, but the underlying pressure is that she must be good at something. That could come across as controlling, even if they're not forcing a specific activity. The daughter feels controlled, which is a red flag. \n\nAt 15, teenagers are developing their own identities. Pushing too hard might backfire, leading to resistance. The parents might not be considering Ellie's autonomy or her interests. Maybe she's not interested in the activities they chose, or she's not ready to commit. The key issue is the pressure to excel at any activity without respecting her current lack of interest. \n\nAlso, the parents mention that doing nothing isn't acceptable. But maybe they're not giving her the space to explore or the freedom to choose what's meaningful to her. The daughter's well-being and self-motivation are important. If the parents are pushing despite her resistance, that could be the wrong approach. \n\nOn the other hand, parents often want the best for their kids. However, the line between support and control is thin. The daughter's reaction suggests the approach is making her feel pressured. The answer might lean towards the parents being in the wrong because they're imposing expectations without considering Ellie's feelings or autonomy. So, Answer A.\n"
