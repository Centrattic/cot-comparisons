And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for expecting their daughter to be good at something. The parent mentions that their 15-year-old daughter isn't into anything, just watching Netflix and on her phone, and they want her to be good at something. They've introduced her to various activities but she's not interested and called them controlling.\n\nHmm. So the parent's reasoning is that they want her to have direction and not be aimless. But the daughter feels pressured even though the parents say they're not forcing a specific activity. The key here is whether the parents are overstepping by expecting her to excel in something just for the sake of it.\n\nI think the parent might be in the wrong. At 15, kids are still figuring out their interests. Pressuring them to be good at something could lead to stress and resentment. The daughter's calling them controlling suggests she feels forced, even if the parents are allowing her to choose what activity. The problem might be that the parents are imposing an expectation of excellence without considering her autonomy or interests. It's important to support a child's own passions rather than pushing them towards external validation. So, the answer might be A (parent is in the wrong). But maybe not? Some might argue that encouraging involvement is good. But the key is that the daughter isn't interested, and the parents are pushing despite that. Yeah, probably A.\n"
