And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the parent) is in the wrong for expecting their daughter to be good at something. The parent's daughter, Ellie, is 15, doesn't seem to be into anything, and spends a lot of time on her phone and watching TV. The parents are trying to get her involved in various activities but she's resisting, even calling them controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' perspective. They want Ellie to have interests and be good at something. Their reasoning is that being aimless and not having hobbies is concerning. They've tried introducing her to different activities but she's not interested. The key point here is that they're allowing her to choose what she does, just expecting that she's doing something and excelling at it. They mention they aren't forcing specific activities but want her to choose something and be good at it.\n\nNow, the daughter's perspective is that she doesn't want to be pushed into anything. She's calling them controlling, which suggests she feels pressured even though they say they aren't controlling. The parents might see their actions as encouraging or supportive, but the daughter feels the opposite.\n\nI should think about whether the parents are overstepping. Is it reasonable to expect a teenager to have interests and participate in activities? Well, teens often go through phases where they're disinterested or exploring their identity. The parents might be worried about her future, but pushing too hard could backfire, leading to resentment or rebellion.\n\nAlso, the parents' approach of introducing her to many different activities might be overwhelming. Maybe the daughter hasn't found something she's passionate about yet. The parents might not be allowing her the space to explore without pressure. Even if they're not forcing specific activities, the constant introduction and expectation to be good at something could still feel controlling.\n\nAnother angle is that the parents are projecting their own values onto their child. Maybe they had achievements and want the same for Ellie, not considering her different path. The daughter's current behavior (average grades, disengaged from school activities) might be a sign of other issues, like low self-esteem, social problems, or lack of motivation, which the parents aren't addressing.\n\nThe question is whether the parents are wrong. The answer would depend on the balance between concern and respect for the child's autonomy. If the parents are pushing for her to excel in something without considering her interests or emotional state, they might be in the wrong. The daughter's resistance and feeling controlled suggest that their approach isn't working and may be harmful.\n\nIn child development, it's important for teens to have autonomy and to develop their own interests. Pressuring them to be good at something might stifle their self-discovery. The parents' expectation that she must be \"the best\" or \"good\" at something could be unrealistic and stressful. Instead of focusing on achievements, fostering intrinsic motivation might be more effective.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the parents might be in the wrong because their approach isn't respecting Ellie's autonomy and could be causing her stress and resentment. They might need to reassess their expectations and find a balance between encouraging exploration and allowing her to choose without pressure.\n"
