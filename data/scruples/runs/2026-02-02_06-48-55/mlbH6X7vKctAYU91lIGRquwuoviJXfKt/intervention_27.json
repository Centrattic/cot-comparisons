And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for expecting their daughter to be good at something. The parent's daughter, Ellie, is 15 and not involved in anything. Her parents are pushing her to be good at something, even though they let her choose what it is. They introduced her to various activities but she refuses and calls them controlling.\n\nHmm. So the parents want her to have a hobby or something she's good at, but they're not forcing a specific activity. They're giving her options. But Ellie is resistant. The parent feels that doing nothing is not acceptable. The user thinks the parent is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age. 15 is a time when teenagers are figuring out their interests. Parents often want their kids to be involved in activities for personal growth and to build skills. However, pushing too hard might be seen as controlling. The parents say they're not forcing specific things, but they want her to commit to something and be good at it. The daughter feels pressured, even if it's not direct.\n\nIs expecting a child to engage in some activity unreasonable? Maybe not, but the approach could be an issue. The parents are introducing her to many things, but maybe she's not finding something she's interested in. They might be overwhelming her. Also, the daughter's autonomy is important at this age. If she feels controlled, even with the option to choose, that could be problematic.\n\nThe parents might be projecting their own desires onto her, wanting her to have achievements or interests that they value. But every child is different. Maybe the daughter isn't into competitive or structured activities. The parents might need to respect her current phase, understanding that she might not have discovered her passion yet.\n\nOn the other hand, being completely apathetic and not engaging in anything can be a concern. The parents might be worried about her future and want her to develop skills. However, pushing her too hard could backfire, leading to resistance and a negative relationship. The line between support and control is thin here.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the parents have a role in guiding their child, but also respecting her individuality. If Ellie isn't showing interest in any of the activities presented, maybe the parents should explore other avenues or encourage her to find her own interests without pressure. The fact that she called them controlling suggests that she feels pressured, which might indicate that the parents are overstepping, even if their intentions are good.\n\nSo, the answer could be that the parent is in the wrong (A) because they're imposing expectations under the guise of support, leading to the daughter feeling controlled. Alternatively, they might not be in the wrong (B) because they're trying to help her find a direction. But given the daughter's reaction and the push for her to be good at something, it's more likely that the pressure is the issue, making the parents at fault.\n"
