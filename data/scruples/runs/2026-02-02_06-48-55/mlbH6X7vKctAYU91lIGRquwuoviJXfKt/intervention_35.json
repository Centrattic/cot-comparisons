And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their daughter to be good at something. The scenario is that the daughter is 15, not involved in anything, and the parents are pushing her to take up an activity and be good at it. They tried introducing various activities but she called them controlling. The parents say they aren't forcing specific things but want her to do something and be good at it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' perspective. They're concerned about their daughter's lack of engagement and want her to have hobbies or skills. That's a common parental concern. They're trying to encourage her, which can be a good thing. But the daughter isn't interested and feels controlled.\n\nNow, the key points here. At 15, a teenager is developing their own identity. Pushing for them to be \"the best\" or \"good at something\" might come off as pressure. The parents say they're letting her choose, but the underlying expectation is that she must excel in whatever she picks. That could be conflicting. The daughter's resistance is natural; she might feel her autonomy is being invaded.\n\nThe parents' approach could be seen as well-intentioned but perhaps unrealistic. Not everyone excels in competitive or visible areas. Some people find fulfillment in different ways. The parents' frustration is valid, but their method might be too prescriptive. They mention introducing her to many activities, but maybe they didn't consider her interests or that she might prefer less structured options.\n\nAlso, the phrase \"doing nothing isn't acceptable\" might be the crux. The parents view inactivity negatively, which is understandable, but the solution of forcing participation in structured activities might not address the root issue. Maybe the daughter has different ways of engaging that the parents aren't considering.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, it's about the balance between encouragement and pressure. The parents want the best for their child, but their expectation that she must be good at something could be imposing their own values. The daughter's reaction as controlling suggests the parents aren't respecting her agency. So, the answer might lean towards A, yes, they're in the wrong because they're setting a high-pressure expectation without considering her individuality and autonomy.\n"
