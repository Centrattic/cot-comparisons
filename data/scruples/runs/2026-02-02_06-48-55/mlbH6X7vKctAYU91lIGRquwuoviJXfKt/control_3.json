And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The parent is asking if they're in the wrong for expecting their daughter, Ellie, to be good at something. Ellie is 15, not into anything, and the parents are pushing her to get involved in activities. They've tried introducing various things but she resists, calling them controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' intentions. They mention they want her to be good at something, which is a common parental desire to see their kids engaged and successful. But their approach might be the issue. They say they're letting her choose but insist she must do something and be good at it. That sounds like pressure even if they're not forcing specific activities. The daughter feels controlled, which is a sign the parents might be overstepping.\n\nThen there's the aspect of Ellie's current behavior. She's 15, an age where teens often explore interests. If she's not into anything, maybe she's still figuring out what she likes. The parents might not be respecting her autonomy by pressuring her to excel. The daughter's reaction of calling them controlling suggests she feels pressured, which could lead to resistance instead of motivation.\n\nAlso, the parents' definition of success here is having her excel in some area. But is that fair? Everyone has different strengths and passions. Maybe Ellie is content with her average grades and leisure activities. The parents might not realize that being \"the best\" isn't the only path to a fulfilling life. They might be projecting their own values or fears onto her.\n\nAnother angle: the parents are introducing her to various activities, which is good, but if she's not showing interest, pushing too hard could backfire. It's possible they're not giving her the space to explore at her own pace. The key difference between encouraging and pressuring is whether the child feels supported or forced. If Ellie feels forced, even with options, it's not her choice.\n\nOn the other hand, parents often want their kids to have structured activities and skills. But the line between support and control is thin. The parents might not be wrong in wanting her to engage in activities, but their insistence that she must be \"good\" at something and their reaction to her resistance could be problematic. They might need to adjust their approach, focusing on encouraging exploration without the pressure to excel immediately.\n\nIn summary, the parents' main issue is the pressure to excel rather than allowing Ellie to explore her interests without judgment. Their insistence on being \"good\" at something and the daughter's feeling of control suggest they're in the wrong.\n"
