And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for expecting their daughter to be good at something. The daughter is 15, not involved in anything, and the parents want her to be the best or at least good at something. They've tried introducing various activities but she's resistant and called them controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' perspective. They want their daughter to have interests and talents, which is a common parental desire. They're not forcing specific activities but are pushing for her to participate in something. They mention she's aimless and spends time on TV and phone, which they find concerning. Their goal is to get her engaged, which is understandable.\n\nOn the other hand, the daughter is 15, an adolescent. At that age, teens often start asserting their independence. The parents' approach might come across as pressuring, even if they claim to be letting her choose. The daughter feeling controlled could lead to resistance and a lack of intrinsic motivation. The key here is whether the parents are respecting her autonomy while encouraging exploration.\n\nThe parents are allowing her to choose the activity but expecting her to be good at it. That might be the issue. Expecting proficiency can create stress and might lead to her avoiding activities out of fear of not meeting expectations. It's possible that the pressure is causing her to shut down rather than explore. \n\nAlso, the parents might not realize that finding passion takes time. Not every teenager has clear interests yet. The fact that they've introduced her to various activities but she hasn't found one she likes yet doesn't mean she's incapable or lazy. Maybe they're moving too fast or not giving her enough space to discover her own interests without the pressure of being the best.\n\nIn terms of rights and wrongs, it's a balance between support and autonomy. The parents' intentions are good, but their approach might be flawed. They need to consider their daughter's feelings and perhaps step back to let her explore at her own pace without the expectation of being \"good at something.\" The daughter's reaction (calling them controlling) suggests that the current approach is counterproductive. \n\nSo, while the parents have valid concerns, their method of addressing them might be where they're wrong. They should focus on fostering a love for activities rather than expecting excellence. Therefore, the author (the parents) might be in the wrong for not respecting their daughter's autonomy and for imposing expectations that could be causing resistance.\n"
