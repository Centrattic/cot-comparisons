And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for expecting their daughter to excel at something. The daughter is 15, not into anything, and the parents are pushing her to be good at something. They've tried introducing her to various activities but she's resistant and called them controlling. The parents say they're not forcing specific choices but want her to do something and be good at it.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are the parents' expectations versus the daughter's autonomy. The parents want her to have a hobby or activity where she excels, but they're pushing her, which the daughter sees as controlling. The parents argue they're giving her freedom in what to choose but still want her to commit to something.\n\nI need to consider if expecting a child to be good at something is inherently wrong. On one hand, parents often want their kids to have interests and skills, which can be beneficial. But on the other hand, pressuring a teenager to meet expectations without considering their own interests or the stress that causes might be problematic. The daughter's resistance suggests she feels the pressure is too much, even if the parents aren't dictating the activity.\n\nThe parents might be overstepping by requiring her to be \"good\" at something, not just participate. The fact that they've tried multiple activities and she's still not into any might mean they're not respecting her lack of interest. Even if they're giving her choices, the underlying expectation that she must perform well could be the issue. Teenagers need autonomy, and pushing for excellence without considering her feelings or natural inclinations could be harmful.\n\nSo, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because the parents are imposing their expectations on the daughter's hobbies and achievements, which can be seen as controlling and may not respect her autonomy. The daughter's calling them controlling supports this. The parents might benefit from backing off and finding other ways to encourage her without pressure.\n"
