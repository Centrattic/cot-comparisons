And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their daughter to be the best at something. The daughter is 15, and the parents are concerned she's not into anything, just watching Netflix and on her phone. They've tried introducing her to various activities but she resists and calls them controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' perspective. They want their daughter to have interests and excel in something, which is a common parental desire. They mention they're not forcing specific activities but want her to choose something and be good at it. However, the daughter feels pressured, leading to the conflict.\n\nFrom the daughter's side, at 15, she's in a developmental stage where identity and independence are important. Being pushed to excel might feel like pressure, even if the parents are giving options. The daughter's resistance and labeling them as controlling suggests she feels her autonomy is being undermined.\n\nThe parents might not realize that their expectations, even if framed as support, can be stressful. The key here is the daughter's well-being versus the parents' wishes. While it's natural to want a child to have passions and achievements, pushing without considering her interests and stress could be harmful. The parents might be in the wrong if their approach is pressuring the daughter without respecting her choices and natural inclinations. However, if they're genuinely trying to support and encourage without coercion, maybe they're not entirely at fault. But the daughter's reaction indicates that the current approach isn't working and might be invalidating her feelings. So, the answer leans towards A (the author is in the wrong) because the parents' intentions, while well-meaning, might be imposing their expectations without sufficient respect for the daughter's autonomy and interests.\n"
