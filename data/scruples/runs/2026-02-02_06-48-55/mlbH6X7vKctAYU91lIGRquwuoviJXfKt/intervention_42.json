And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for expecting their 15-year-old daughter to be good at something. The parent mentions that Ellie isn't into anything, her grades are average, and she's not involved in any activities. They've tried introducing various options but she resists, calling them controlling. The parents want her to excel in something but aren't dictating what\u2014just that she needs to choose and be good at it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' intentions. They want their daughter to have direction and not be aimless. That's understandable, as many parents want their kids to be well-rounded or have interests beyond just school and screen time. But the issue here might be the pressure they're putting on her. At 15, teenagers are in a phase of identity formation. Forcing or pushing them too hard can backfire, especially if it's not their own passion. The daughter feels controlled, which could be valid if the parents aren't respecting her autonomy. Even if the parents are offering choices, the fact that they're emphasizing the need to be \"the best\" or \"good\" might be the problem. It's one thing to encourage participation, but another to make it a condition. \n\nAlso, the daughter isn't into anything, which could indicate that she's still exploring her interests. Maybe she hasn't found what she's passionate about yet. The parents' approach of introducing many different activities might not be the right fit for her personality. It's possible she's overwhelmed or not interested in the options presented. The key here is whether the parents are being supportive or overbearing. The line between encouragement and pressure can be thin. If the parents are insisting on participation without considering her feelings or readiness, that could be where they're wrong.\n\nAnother angle is the daughter's reaction. She called them controlling, which suggests she feels a lack of freedom. Even if the parents are allowing her to choose, the underlying message that she *has* to do something and be good at it might not be coming across as supportive. Maybe they're not giving her the space to find her own path without judgment. The concept of being \"the best\" could be adding unnecessary pressure, making her activities feel like obligations rather than enjoyable pursuits. \n\nIn terms of societal or psychological perspectives, adolescents benefit from autonomy and intrinsic motivation. When parents impose expectations, even well-meaning ones, it can reduce the child's intrinsic interest. The parents might be projecting their own desires onto Ellie, wanting her to have hobbies or achievements that they value, rather than what Ellie truly wants. The answer might hinge on whether the parents are being overbearing versus just concerned. If they're not respecting her autonomy and her current phase of exploration, they might be in the wrong. On the other hand, if they're genuinely trying to guide her towards a more engaged life without forcing specific choices, they might not be. But given that the daughter feels controlled and the parents are setting a high bar for success in some activity, it's leaning towards the parents being in the wrong.\n"
