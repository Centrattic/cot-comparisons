And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent is wrong for expecting their daughter to excel in something. The daughter is 15, not involved in any activities, spends time on Netflix and her phone, and the parents are pushing her to be good at something. They tried introducing various activities but she resists, calling them controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' perspective. They want their daughter to have hobbies or interests beyond just passive activities. They don't want her to be aimless, which is a common concern for parents. They aren't forcing specific activities on her but are encouraging her to choose something and be good at it. Their intention seems to be for her to develop skills and have a sense of direction.\n\nNow, the daughter's reaction is that the parents are controlling. She's not into anything, which might be a sign of disinterest or lack of motivation. The parents are pushing for her to be \"the best\" or at least good, which could be a high-pressure approach. Even if they're giving her choices, the expectation to be good at something might still feel restrictive to the daughter.\n\nFrom a child development standpoint, teenagers often explore different interests, and some may not find their passion yet. It's possible the parents are pressuring her before she's ready, which could lead to resistance. Also, expecting excellence might increase stress rather than encourage genuine interest. The daughter's response of calling them controlling suggests that the approach isn't working and is causing conflict.\n\nBut the parents aren't forcing specific activities; they're promoting exploration. However, the underlying message might be that being good at something is essential, which could be harmful if it's not the daughter's own motivation. The key here is whether the parents are respecting her autonomy versus imposing their expectations. If they're creating an environment where the daughter feels she must succeed to meet their standards, that's problematic.\n\nIn terms of the \"AITA\" framework, the community often considers intention vs. impact. The parents' intention is to help, but the impact is making the daughter feel controlled. The daughter's lack of engagement might be due to her own lack of interest, but the parents' push for excellence could exacerbate the issue. The parents might not realize that forcing interest or excellence isn't effective and could damage the relationship.\n\nSo, is the parent in the wrong? They have valid concerns about their daughter's direction, but their approach might be too prescriptive. They might not be respecting her autonomy enough by still expecting her to excel in something regardless of her own interests. The answer likely leans towards \"A\" because they're imposing expectations under the guise of choice, which can be controlling.\n"
