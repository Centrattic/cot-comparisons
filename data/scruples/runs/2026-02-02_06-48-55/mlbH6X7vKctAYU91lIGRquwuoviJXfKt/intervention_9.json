And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for expecting their 15-year-old daughter to excel at something. The parent mentions that Ellie isn't into anything, has average grades, and mainly does nothing at home except watch TV and use her phone. They want her to be good at something, so they've introduced her to various activities, but she's resistant and feels controlled.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the parent's perspective. They're worried about their daughter not having direction and want her to have a hobby or skill. That's a common concern. But the key issue here is how they're approaching it. They say they're not forcing her to do something specific, but they want her to choose something and be good at it. The daughter feels controlled, even if the parents don't see themselves that way.\n\nSo, is expecting a teenager to have a hobby or talent unreasonable? Well, some parents might think it's important for their child to have interests beyond school and social media. But at 15, teenagers are often exploring their identities. Forcing or even pressuring them to excel in something might backfire. The daughter's resistance could be a sign that she's not being heard, even if the parents think they're being supportive.\n\nThe parents are introducing her to various activities, which is positive. However, the daughter's reaction of feeling controlled suggests that the approach might be too pushy. The parents might not realize that their constant introduction to new activities, even if well-intentioned, can feel overwhelming or like an ultimatum. The phrase \"as long as she does something and is good at it\" implies that the parents have certain expectations of success, which might not align with the daughter's interests or comfort level.\n\nAlso, the daughter's current activities (Netflix and phone) aren't inherently bad. It's possible she's finding comfort in these, and the parents are trying to redirect her. But the way they're doing it might be too heavy-handed. The teenager might need space to explore her own interests without feeling pressured to meet parental expectations.\n\nIn terms of whether the parents are in the wrong, it's a judgment call. They have valid concerns about their daughter's direction, but their approach might be contributing to the problem. The daughter's feeling of being controlled is a red flag. Even if the parents aren't forcing specific choices, the underlying message that she \"has to do something and be good at it\" could be pressuring her. The answer might depend on cultural norms too\u2014some cultures emphasize achievement and participation more than others.\n\nSo, considering all that, the parents might be in the wrong because their approach is causing conflict and the daughter feels controlled, even if they don't intend to be. The answer would be A.\n"
