And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their 15-year-old daughter to be good at something. The daughter isn't involved in anything, just watching TV and on her phone. The parents want her to be good at something, so they've tried introducing her to various activities, but she's not interested and calls them controlling. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' intentions. They want their daughter to have hobbies or interests, which is a common concern. But the approach might be the issue. They mention they're letting her choose anything as long as she's good at it. Wait, that part is confusing. They say they're not forcing specific activities but want her to be good at something. That could imply some pressure, even if they're not dictating what she should do. The daughter feels controlled, which suggests that their approach might be too pushy.\n\nAdolescence is a time when teens are forming their identities. If the parents are pressuring her to excel in something without her interest, that could be problematic. The daughter's response of being on her phone and TV might be her way of coping or avoiding the pressure. Also, expecting her to be \"the best\" or at least good might be unrealistic if she's not naturally inclined or interested in those areas.\n\nThe parents are introducing her to many activities, but if she's not finding something she likes, maybe they need to step back. The key here is whether the pressure is coming across as controlling, even if it's well-intentioned. The daughter's calling them controlling is a red flag. It might be the parents' approach that's too demanding, not the intent. So maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong because they're imposing expectations without respecting her interests and autonomy, leading to the daughter feeling controlled.\n"
