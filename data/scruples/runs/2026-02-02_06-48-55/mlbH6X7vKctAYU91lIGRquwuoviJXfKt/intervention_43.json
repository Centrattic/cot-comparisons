And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their daughter, Ellie, to be good at something. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the parents are concerned that their 15-year-old isn't into anything. She has average grades and doesn't participate in clubs, sports, or other activities. They want her to be good at something, so they've tried introducing her to various options, but she's resistant and called them controlling. The parents feel they're not controlling but want her to choose something and excel at it. The question is whether they're wrong for having this expectation.\n\nHmm, I need to consider different angles. On one hand, parents often want their kids to develop skills or interests. It's common to encourage participation in activities to build confidence or future opportunities. But the key here is the pressure. The parents seem to be pushing Ellie to find something and be good at it, but they're not forcing a specific activity. They let her choose, but the underlying message is that doing nothing is unacceptable. \n\nEllie is 15, which is a time when teens might be figuring out their interests. Forcing or even expecting excellence might stifle her natural exploration. If she's not interested in the options provided, maybe the problem isn't her but the approach. The parents might be imposing their own values or fears (like not having hobbies) onto Ellie. Also, calling her \"aimless\" could be dismissive of her current phase.\n\nThe daughter's reaction of feeling controlled suggests that the approach is causing stress. Even if the parents think they're not controlling, the child's perception matters. The phrase \"as long as she does something and is good at it\" implies that her choice isn't enough unless she excels, which adds pressure. It's possible the parents are not respecting Ellie's autonomy, which is crucial at her age. \n\nBut another angle is that the parents want to help her avoid a future of inactivity or lack of direction. They might genuinely care about her well-being. However, the method might be flawed. Maybe they should focus on supporting her interests rather than pushing for excellence. The answer hinges on whether expecting excellence in any chosen activity is reasonable versus being overbearing.\n\nIn terms of societal perspectives, some might argue that parents have a right to encourage their children's development, while others would say it's the child's right to choose without pressure. The line between support and pressure is thin here. Since the parents are introducing various options but still expecting her to commit to something and excel, maybe they're not entirely wrong, but their approach might be too rigid. However, the fact that Ellie is feeling controlled suggests the parents might be overstepping, even if their intentions are good. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the answer leans towards the parents being in the wrong because they're imposing an expectation of excellence without considering Ellie's own interests and readiness. They might be projecting their desires onto her instead of allowing her to develop at her own pace.\n"
