And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The parent wants their daughter to be good at something, so they've tried introducing her to various activities. The daughter isn't interested and feels controlled. The parents argue they're not forcing her to do anything specific but want her to commit to something. \n\nHmm, the key here is whether expecting the daughter to be good at something is reasonable. The parents aren't dictating the activity, which is a good point. But maybe they're pushing too hard by listing all the options and expecting her to excel. Teenagers often explore different interests, and not having a specific passion yet is normal.\n\nAlso, the daughter is 15, which is a time when kids start to find their own interests. The parents might be projecting their own expectations onto her. Telling her she's \"aimless\" could be dismissive of her current phase. The daughter feels pressured even though the parents say they're not controlling. There's a difference between encouraging exploration and imposing structured expectations.\n\nI think the parents might be in the wrong because they're pressuring her to achieve without considering her need to explore at her own pace. The answer might be A.\n"
