And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for expecting their 15-year-old daughter to be good at something. The parent mentions that the daughter isn't into anything, has average grades, doesn't participate in activities, and they want her to be good at something. They've tried introducing various activities but she resists and calls them controlling.\n\nHmm. The parent argues they're not forcing specific interests but want her to choose something and excel. The daughter is 15, which is a time when teens often explore their own interests. The parents might feel concern about her lack of direction, but is it right to push her to be \"the best\" or \"good\" at something? \n\nThe daughter's calling them controlling suggests there's conflict. The parents are allowing her to choose but with the condition that she must be good at it. But maybe they're imposing pressure without considering her preferences or the stress that might cause. Adolescents need autonomy, and pushing for excellence in any area might not align with her current interests or personality. \n\nOn the other hand, wanting the child to have hobbies and engage in activities is common. However, the approach here might be too rigid. The key issue is whether expecting her to excel at something is reasonable. The parents might not be controlling in the traditional sense, but their expectations could be unrealistic. \n\nI think the parent is in the wrong because they're setting a condition that she must be good at something, which might not respect her autonomy. The daughter's resistance indicates she feels pressured, even if the parents think they're giving options. The focus on being \"the best\" or \"good\" could stifle her natural exploration. So, answer A.\n"
