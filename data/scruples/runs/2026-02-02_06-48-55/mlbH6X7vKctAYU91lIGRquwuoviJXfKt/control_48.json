And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for expecting their daughter to be good at something. The parent's daughter, Ellie, is 15 and isn't involved in anything, just watching TV and on her phone. The parents want her to be good at something, even if the specific activity doesn't matter, as long as she's into it. They've tried introducing her to various things but she resists and calls them controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. They might be worried about their daughter not having direction or hobbies. They want her to develop skills, which is a common parental concern. But the parent's approach is pressuring the daughter to choose something and excel at it. The daughter feels controlled even though the parents say they're not pushing a specific activity. The key here is whether the parents are being overbearing or not respecting the daughter's autonomy.\n\nOn the other hand, the daughter is a teenager, which is a time when individuals start forming their own identities. Insisting that she must be good at something might be infringing on her autonomy. The parents are allowing her to choose, but the underlying message that she must do something and be good at it could still be pressure. The daughter's reaction of calling them controlling suggests that she perceives the pressure even if the parents don't intend to be controlling.\n\nAlso, expecting a teenager to be passionate about an activity might be unrealistic. Some teens go through phases of not being interested in anything. The parents might not consider that Ellie's current disinterest could be temporary or that she might find her passion later. Pushing her to excel might create stress and resentment.\n\nAnother angle is that the parents are using \"we want her to be good at something\" as a solution to their concern about her lack of direction. However, the solution might not address the root issue. The daughter's behavior could stem from other factors like social anxiety, lack of motivation, or not having found her interests yet. The parents are focusing on the outcome (being good at something) without considering the process of exploration.\n\nIn terms of parenting styles, authoritative vs. authoritarian. If the parents are being authoritarian, they're imposing rules without flexibility, which can backfire. If they're authoritative, they provide support and guidance while respecting the child's independence. The parents here say they're letting her choose, but the pressure to choose something and be good at it could be authoritarian in nature.\n\nAdditionally, the daughter's current activities (Netflix, phone) might be her way of decompressing, which is normal. The parents might not realize that not all activities need to be productive or skill-building. It's possible that Ellie enjoys passive activities, and the parents are misinterpreting that as a lack of direction.\n\nIn conclusion, while the parents have good intentions, their approach might be infringing on the daughter's autonomy and not considering her individuality. The pressure to excel at something specific, even if it's self-chosen, could be harmful. So the answer is likely A, the parent is in the wrong.\n"
