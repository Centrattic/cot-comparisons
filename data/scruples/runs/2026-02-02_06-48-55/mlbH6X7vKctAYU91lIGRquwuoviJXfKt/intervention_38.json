And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The parent is asking if they're in the wrong for expecting their daughter to be good at something. The daughter is 15, not into anything, and the parents are pushing her to engage in activities.\n\nFirst, every parent wants their child to have interests and hobbies. It's natural to want them to be involved and maybe excel. But here, the parents might be mixing up their expectations with their daughter's interests. They're introducing her to various activities but she's resisting, calling them controlling. Even though they say they're not forcing specific choices, the underlying pressure is there: she must excel at something. \n\nAt 15, teenagers are often figuring out their own identities. Forcing them into something they aren't interested in can backfire. The parents might not be controlling in the traditional sense, but their insistence on her being good at something could be stifling her autonomy. The daughter's response of calling them controlling suggests that she feels pressured despite their claims of letting her choose. \n\nAlso, expecting someone to be \"the best\" or \"at least good\" at an activity can create stress and anxiety, especially if the child isn't naturally inclined towards it. The parents are focusing on the outcome (being good) rather than the process (exploring interests). It's possible that Ellie hasn't found something she's passionate about yet, and the parents' approach might be hindering her from doing so. \n\nOn the other hand, the parents are concerned about her lack of direction. They might believe that being involved in activities is important for her development. However, their method of introducing her to everything without allowing her the space to discover her own interests could be problematic. The key issue is whether they're respecting her autonomy versus pushing her towards their expectations. \n\nIn conclusion, while the parents' intentions are good, their approach might be too prescriptive. They might be in the wrong because they're not allowing their daughter the freedom to explore without the pressure of excelling. The daughter's resistance indicates that she's not feeling supported in her own path. So, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
