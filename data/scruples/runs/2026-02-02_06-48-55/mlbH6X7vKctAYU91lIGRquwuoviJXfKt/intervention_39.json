And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for expecting their daughter to be good at something. The parent mentions that their daughter isn't involved in any activities, has average grades, and mainly uses her time on TV and phone. They've tried introducing various activities but the daughter feels controlled.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. They want their daughter to have interests and skills, which seems reasonable. Parents often encourage their kids to explore hobbies and develop talents. However, the daughter is 15, an age where she might be figuring out her own interests. The parent is pushing for her to be \"good\" at something, which could come across as pressuring her, even if they're not forcing a specific activity.\n\nThe key points here are the pressure vs. support. The parents say they're letting her choose, but they want her to be good at whatever she picks. The daughter feels controlled, so there might be a mismatch between what the parents intend and how the daughter perceives it. Also, expecting excellence without considering her natural inclinations or the stress that might cause could be problematic. \n\nAnother angle is the daughter's autonomy. At 15, she might need space to explore her own interests without parental pressure. The parents' concern about her being \"aimless\" is valid, but the approach might not be the right one. They're emphasizing the outcome (being good) rather than the process of trying things out. It's possible that the daughter is disinterested because she's not finding activities she genuinely likes, or maybe she's overwhelmed by the expectations.\n\nIn terms of whether the parent is in the wrong, it's a bit nuanced. They have a valid concern about their daughter's engagement, but the way they're addressing it might be contributing to the daughter's resistance. The pressure to be good at something could be counterproductive, leading her to shut down rather than engage. The parent might be overlooking that the daughter needs to find her own passion, not just meet parental expectations.\n\nSo, considering the daughter's perspective and the potential negative effects of pressure, the parent's approach might be misguided. The answer would lean towards the parent being in the wrong because their expectations could be stifling the daughter's autonomy and intrinsic motivation.\n"
