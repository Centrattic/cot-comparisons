And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the parent is wrong for expecting their daughter to be the best at something. So, the parent says Ellie is 15, not into anything, has average grades, and spends a lot of time on her phone and Netflix. They've tried introducing her to various activities, but she's resistant and called them controlling. The parents want her to be good at something, maybe for her future.\n\nHmm, so the parents are pushing Ellie to find a passion or talent. But they say they're not forcing her to do anything specific, just that she needs to do something and be good at it. They mention they've tried multiple options. The daughter feels controlled even though the parents claim they're not being controlling.\n\nFrom a parenting perspective, it's a common issue. Some might argue that every child is different. Maybe Ellie isn't interested in the activities the parents tried. The parents might be projecting their own ambitions onto her. They want her to have something to fall back on, which is understandable, but pushing too hard could backfire. The daughter's resistance and labeling them as controlling suggests that the pressure might be coming through, even if unintended.\n\nAlso, at 15, she's in a stage where identity is forming. Pressuring her might lead to rebellion or lack of intrinsic motivation. It's possible the parents are not respecting her autonomy by expecting her to excel in something, regardless of her interests. The key point is that the parents are allowing her to choose but still expecting excellence, which could be conflicting. Maybe they should focus more on supporting her interests rather than pushing for excellence in any area.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents are concerned about her not being involved. It's their responsibility to encourage some level of engagement. However, the approach might be too rigid. The line between support and pressure is thin here. So, is the parent in the wrong? If they're pushing for her to be good at something without considering her interests and she's reacting negatively, that could be problematic. The answer might be A (yes, the parent is in the wrong) because their expectations might not align with the daughter's needs and interests, leading to conflict without a constructive approach.\n"
