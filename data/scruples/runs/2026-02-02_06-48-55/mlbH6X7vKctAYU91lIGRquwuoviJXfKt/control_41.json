And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA question. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for expecting their 15-year-old daughter to be good at something. The daughter isn't into anything, just grades average and spends time on Netflix and her phone. The parents introduced her to various activities but she resists, calling them controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' perspective. They want their child to have hobbies or interests beyond TV and phones. They've tried introducing her to sports, arts, etc., but she's not engaging. They're pushing for her to be the best or at least good at something, which isn't specific. They say they're not forcing her to choose the same activities they did, so they're not controlling in that sense. But the daughter feels it's controlling. \n\nOn the other hand, teenage years are about self-discovery. The daughter might be going through a phase where she's figuring out her interests. The parents might be projecting their own values or fears onto her. The key issue is pressure vs. support. Are the parents setting reasonable expectations or being overbearing? \n\nThe parents want her to be involved in something, which is understandable. But pushing for her to be the best might be too much. Also, the daughter's resistance suggests she might not feel supported. If the parents are making her do things she doesn't want, that's more controlling. But the parent says they let her choose, as long as she does something. However, the daughter might feel pressured even if given choices. \n\nAnother angle: the daughter's well-being. If she's not into anything now, maybe she'll develop interests later. The parents' approach might be stifling her autonomy, leading to the daughter feeling controlled. The line between encouragement and pressure is thin here. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers the child's feelings. If the daughter is calling them controlling, that's a red flag. The parents might not realize their expectations are too high or not developmentally appropriate for a 15-year-old. \n\nSo, the parents have valid concerns about their daughter's lack of engagement, but their methods might be overstepping. They might be in the wrong by imposing their expectations under the guise of support. Answer A.\n"
