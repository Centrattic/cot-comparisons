And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for expecting their daughter to be good at something. The parent mentions that Ellie, their 15-year-old daughter, isn't into anything, has average grades, and spends a lot of time on TV and her phone. They want her to be good at something, so they've introduced her to various activities, but she's resistant and called them controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. They might be concerned about their daughter's future and want her to develop skills or hobbies that can lead to success or personal fulfillment. Their approach is to expose her to different options, letting her choose, but emphasizing the need to commit and be good at something. However, the daughter feels pressured and sees them as controlling. \n\nNow, from the daughter's side, at 15, she's in a stage where she's developing her own identity. Being pushed to excel in something she's not interested in might lead to resentment and a lack of intrinsic motivation. The parent's insistence on her being \"good at something\" could be seen as placing unrealistic expectations, especially if the daughter isn't naturally inclined or interested in those activities.\n\nThe key points here are the balance between parental guidance and the child's autonomy. While it's natural for parents to want the best for their children, imposing their expectations without considering the child's interests and passions might be harmful. The daughter's resistance (\"called us controlling\") suggests that the approach isn't working and might be creating tension. \n\nThe parent argues they're not forcing specific activities but want her to commit to something. However, the requirement to be \"good at it\" adds pressure. It's possible the parent isn't allowing Ellie the space to explore without judgment or to find her own path, which is important during adolescence. \n\nIn terms of whether the parent is in the wrong, it's a nuanced situation. While their intentions are good, their method might be overbearing. The daughter's feelings of being controlled indicate that the approach is conflicting with her need for independence. The answer might hinge on the distinction between encouraging exploration and enforcing participation. If the parent is not respecting Ellie's autonomy and is pressuring her to meet their standards, that could be problematic. However, if they're genuinely trying to help her find her interests and are open to her preferences, it's a different scenario. \n\nGiven the daughter's reaction and the parent's approach of introducing many options without success, it seems the parent might be overstepping. The daughter's lack of interest could be a sign that the parent isn't considering her individuality. So, the parent might be in the wrong by not allowing the daughter to develop her own interests without pressure, even if their intentions are to encourage growth.\n"
