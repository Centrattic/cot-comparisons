And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for expecting their daughter to excel at something. The parent mentions that their 15-year-old daughter isn't into anything, has average grades, and spends a lot of time on her phone and watching TV. They've tried introducing various activities but she resists and calls them controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's intentions. They want their daughter to have a hobby or activity where she can be good at something. That's a common parental desire, wanting their children to have structure, skills, and interests. However, the key point here is the pressure they're placing on her to be \"the best or at least good\" at something. They mention that she's letting her choose but there's an underlying expectation of excelling.\n\nFrom the daughter's perspective, she's 15, which is a time when teens often explore their interests independently. Feeling forced into activities she doesn't want to do, even if the parents are presenting options, can lead to resistance. The daughter labeling them as controlling suggests that she feels the pressure is more than just offering choices. The parents might be overstepping by not respecting her current lack of interest.\n\nThen there's the aspect of the daughter's current behavior. The parent is concerned about her being \"aimless,\" but it's also possible that the daughter is going through a phase where she hasn't found her passion yet. Pushing her too hard might backfire, leading to resentment or disengagement. It's important to balance encouragement with allowing her autonomy.\n\nThe parent's approach of introducing many different activities could be overwhelming. Instead of forcing participation in multiple options, maybe the parent should focus on supporting her in finding what genuinely interests her, even if it's not a traditional activity. Also, the emphasis on being \"good\" at something might be adding unnecessary stress, which can hinder her natural exploration.\n\nIn terms of societal expectations, there's a common pressure on children to have achievements, but it's crucial to respect individual differences. Not every child will excel in traditional areas, and some may find non-traditional paths. The parents might not be wrong in wanting their child to have direction, but their method could be problematic if it's causing conflict and not respecting the child's autonomy.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the parent's intentions are good, but their execution might be flawed. They are imposing an expectation of excellence without considering the daughter's intrinsic motivation. The answer likely leans towards the parent being in the wrong (A) because they're pressuring her to conform to their expectations rather than supporting her self-directed exploration.\n"
