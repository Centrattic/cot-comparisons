And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for expecting their 15-year-old daughter to be good at something. The daughter isn't involved in any activities, just watching TV and on her phone. The parents are trying to introduce her to various things but she's resistant and calls them controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' perspective. They want their daughter to have interests beyond just leisure activities. They're not forcing her to do something specific but are pushing her to find something she's good at. But maybe they're putting pressure on her to choose an activity, which could be seen as controlling. The daughter feels that way, so there's a conflict here.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents might be concerned about her future, wanting her to develop skills or hobbies that could lead to achievements. But at 15, some teens are still figuring out their interests. Maybe the parents aren't giving her enough time or space to explore on her own. If they're forcing her to choose something without her input, that could be problematic. The daughter might feel her autonomy is being invaded, even if the parents are trying to be supportive.\n\nAlso, the parents mention they're letting her choose anything as long as she's good at it. But expecting her to be good at it might add pressure. Maybe the issue is the expectation to excel rather than just participate. The daughter might feel the activities aren't for fun but as a performance, which could lead to resistance.\n\nIt's important to balance parental guidance with respecting the child's own pace and interests. If the parents are pushing too hard without considering her preferences, they might be in the wrong. However, their concern about her current lack of engagement is valid. The key is whether they're being supportive without being overbearing.\n\nSo, considering all this, the parents might be overstepping by not allowing her the space to find her own path, especially if their approach is making her feel controlled. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the parent being in the wrong.\n"
