  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for expecting my daughter to be the best at something?\nMy daughter, let's call her Ellie, is 15. And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a parent (the author) who's upset because their 15-year-old daughter, Ellie, isn't into anything. The parents want her to be good at something, but Ellie is just watching TV and on her phone. The parents have tried introducing her to various activities but she's not interested and called them controlling. The author says they're not forcing her to do what they did, just want her to choose something and be good at it.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the parents' perspective. They're concerned about their daughter's lack of engagement and want her to have hobbies or skills. But maybe they're being too pushy? The daughter is 15, which is a time when teens often start asserting independence. If the parents are pressuring her to find something, even if it's framed as \"you can choose anything,\" she might feel controlled because they're emphasizing the need to be good at it. The daughter might feel like her choices are limited or that the parents are dissatisfied no matter what she does.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents might be worried about her future or wanting her to have interests beyond screens. But forcing her to participate in activities she doesn't want could backfire. The key point here is whether the parents are respecting Ellie's autonomy. Even if they're not being explicit about choosing their own interests, their insistence on her being \"good at something\" might be imposing their expectations on her. The daughter's reaction of calling them controlling suggests that she feels pressured, which could mean the parents are overstepping.\n\nAlso, grades are average and she's not involved in school activities. Maybe there are other factors, like social issues or personal interests not being considered. The parents might not realize that Ellie's interests lie in different areas not being offered, or she might feel overwhelmed by the options presented. At 15, some teens are still figuring out what they like, and pushing too hard could make her tune out even more.\n\nSo, considering all that, the parents might be in the wrong by expecting her to excel in something without respecting her current interests and autonomy. They want her to choose but with the condition of being good at it, which adds pressure. The daughter feeling controlled indicates that the parents' approach might be too controlling despite their intentions.\n"
