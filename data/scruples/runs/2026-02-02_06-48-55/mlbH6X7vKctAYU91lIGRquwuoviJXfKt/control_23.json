And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the parent is wrong for expecting their daughter to be good at something. The daughter is 15, not involved in any activities, and the parents want her to excel in something, but she's not interested.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' perspective. They might be worried about their daughter's future, seeing her as aimless. They're trying to push her to find a passion, which is common for parents. They mention they're not forcing specific activities but want her to choose something and be good at it. However, the daughter feels controlled, which is a key point.\n\nNow, the daughter's age is 15, which is adolescence. At this age, teens often explore their interests and may resist parental pressure. The parents are pushing for her to be \"the best\" or \"good\" at something, which might be setting high expectations. But it's important to respect her autonomy. Forcing or pressuring a teenager can lead to resistance and conflict, as seen here where the daughter called them controlling.\n\nThe parents are introducing her to various activities, which is good, but the daughter isn't interested. Maybe she hasn't found her interest yet. Expecting her to be good at something might not be realistic if she's not engaged. The focus on being \"the best\" could be problematic because it's not about her personal growth but meeting external standards.\n\nLegally and ethically, parents have a role in guiding their children, but it's crucial to balance guidance with respect for the child's choices. The parents are not forcing specific activities, so they don't cross into legal territory. However, from a psychological standpoint, pushing a teenager to conform to parental expectations can harm her self-esteem and intrinsic motivation.\n\nThe daughter's lack of involvement might have other reasons\u2014like social anxiety, lack of interest in traditional activities, or different passions not yet explored. The parents' approach might be too rigid. Encouraging without pressuring is key. The phrase \"as long as she does something and is good at it\" implies that the parents value her competence in an area, but forcing her to pursue something she's not interested in might not lead to her being good at it.\n\nIn conclusion, while the parents have good intentions, their approach might be too controlling. The daughter's reaction suggests that the pressure is causing her to feel controlled, which can be detrimental. The right approach would be to support her in exploring her interests without imposing expectations of excellence. Therefore, the parents might be in the wrong by not respecting her current lack of interest and autonomy.\n"
