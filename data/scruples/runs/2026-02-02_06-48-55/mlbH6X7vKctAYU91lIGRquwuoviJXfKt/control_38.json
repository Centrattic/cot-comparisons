And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for expecting their daughter to be good at something. The parent wrote that their 15-year-old daughter isn't into anything, has average grades, and just watches TV and uses her phone. They want her to be good at something, even if they don't specify what. They've tried introducing various activities, but she's resistant and called them controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's intentions. They might be concerned about their daughter's future and want her to have skills or passions. But the pressure could be coming from a place of wanting to push her into something, even if she's not interested. At 15, teenagers are often figuring themselves out. Forcing them into activities they don't enjoy might backfire, leading to resentment or burnout. The daughter's response of calling them controlling suggests she feels pressured, even if the parents say they're letting her choose.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents might argue they're just encouraging their child to find a passion. However, the key point is that the daughter isn't interested in any of the activities they've tried, and they're pushing her to be \"the best\" at something. The focus on being \"good at something\" could be more about the parents' expectations rather than the daughter's interests. It's important for children to explore their own interests without external pressure. The parents might be in the wrong if their expectations are unrealistic or if they're not respecting their daughter's autonomy. So the answer is likely A (yes, the parent is in the wrong) because they're imposing their expectations without considering the daughter's preferences and natural inclinations.\n"
