And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for expecting their daughter to be good at something. The parent's daughter, Ellie, is 15 and doesn't seem to be into anything, just watching TV and using her phone. The parents want her to be good at something, so they've introduced her to various activities, but she's resistant and called them controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' perspective. They might feel that their daughter needs direction and that having a hobby or skill is important for her development. Maybe they're concerned about her future or her social life. They do say they let her choose whatever she wants, as long as she does something and is good at it. So they're not forcing a specific activity, but they do want some sort of engagement.\n\nOn the other hand, the daughter is 15, which is a time when teens often start to assert their independence. The fact that she's calling them controlling suggests there's tension. The parents might be imposing their expectations without considering her interests or the pressure she might feel. Even if they're giving her choices, the underlying message might be that she isn't meeting their standards unless she's good at something. That could be stressful for her.\n\nI should also think about the daughter's situation. If she's not interested in any of the activities presented, maybe the problem is that the parents aren't supporting her existing interests or giving her space to find her own path. Forcing someone to be good at something they're not interested in could be counterproductive. It's possible that Ellie has interests the parents haven't discovered yet, or maybe she's content with her current activities, which are just low-key.\n\nAnother angle: the parents want her to be \"the best\" or \"good\" at something. Is it reasonable to expect a teenager to excel at something they haven't naturally gravitated towards? Maybe the parents are projecting their own aspirations onto Ellie. It's possible they're trying to compensate for their own unfulfilled goals or societal pressures about success.\n\nAlso, the parents mention that doing nothing isn't acceptable. But maybe \"doing nothing\" in terms of structured activities isn't necessarily bad. Some teens might prefer more unstructured time, which can be important for mental health. The parents might be underestimating the value of downtime or Ellie's ability to self-direct in her own way.\n\nSo, considering all this, the parents might be in the wrong because they're imposing their expectations without respecting Ellie's autonomy and interests. Even if their intentions are good, pressuring a teenager to excel at something they don't care about can lead to resentment and lack of genuine engagement. The daughter needs to find her own passions, and the parents' approach might be stifling that process. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
