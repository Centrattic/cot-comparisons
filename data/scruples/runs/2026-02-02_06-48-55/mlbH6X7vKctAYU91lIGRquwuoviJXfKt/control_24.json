And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the parent is wrong here. The parent is worried about their 15-year-old daughter, Ellie, who isn't involved in anything, just watching Netflix and using her phone. They want her to be good at something, so they've tried introducing various activities, but she's resistant and called them controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's intentions. They mention they aren't forcing specific activities they like, just letting her choose anything as long as she does something and is good at it. But they stress that doing nothing isn't acceptable. That part is a bit tricky. Encouraging a child to have interests and develop skills is normal, but the pressure to be \"good at something\" might be problematic.\n\nAt 15, teenagers often explore different interests, and it's not unusual for some to take time to find their passion. The parent is pushing for her to excel, but if Ellie isn't finding something she's into, forcing her might lead to resistance. The term \"controlling\" from Ellie suggests that the pressure is making her feel pushed rather than supported. The parents might be imposing their expectations without considering Ellie's autonomy or that she might be going through a phase where she's figuring things out.\n\nAlso, the phrase \"we want her to be good at something\" implies a desire for her to achieve, which might stem from their own values or fears. However, it's important to respect a child's individuality. If the parents are making her feel like she's not meeting their standards, that could harm her self-esteem and motivation. The key issue here is the balance between encouragement and pressure. While it's okay to encourage exploration, expecting excellence in something without the child's interest might be unreasonable.\n\nAnother angle is that the parents might be projecting their own experiences. Maybe they value being involved in activities, but that doesn't mean Ellie must follow the same path. It's possible she has different priorities or is introverted and doesn't need the same level of external involvement. Pushing her could be counterproductive, leading her to disengage further from activities altogether.\n\nIn terms of the parent's approach, offering many options is good, but the underlying message is that she must be good at something, which might be the root of the conflict. The parents should consider whether their expectations are realistic and if they're providing a supportive environment where Ellie can explore without the pressure of being the \"best.\" It's also about whether they're allowing her to find her own interests without judgment.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the parents' intentions are from a place of concern, but their method might be too controlling. The daughter feels it's controlling, so the parents might be overstepping by not giving her the space to develop her own interests naturally. The answer would likely be that the parent is in the wrong (A) because they are imposing expectations that could be harmful and not respecting the daughter's autonomy.\n"
