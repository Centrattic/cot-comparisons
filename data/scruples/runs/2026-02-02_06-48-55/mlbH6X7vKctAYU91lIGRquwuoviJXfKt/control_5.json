And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author (a parent) is in the wrong for expecting their 15-year-old daughter to be good at something. The parent is concerned because Ellie isn't involved in any activities, just watching TV and using her phone. They've tried introducing her to various things but she resists, calling them controlling. The parents want her to be good at something, but are letting her choose what.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' perspective. They care about their daughter's future and want her to have interests and skills. It's common for parents to hope their kids find something they're passionate about. But there's a line between encouraging and pressuring. The parents say they're not forcing specific activities but want her to choose something and excel. However, Ellie feels controlled. \n\nNow, looking at Ellie's age. At 15, she's a teenager, which is a time when identity and independence are important. If she's not showing interest in any of the activities introduced, maybe the approach isn't right. The parents might be imposing their expectations without considering Ellie's preferences or her reasons for not engaging. \n\nThe key issue here is the pressure to be \"the best\" or \"good\" at something. The parents might not realize that the problem isn't Ellie's lack of activity per se, but their imposition of expectations. It's possible that Ellie is content without structured activities, or she might not have found what interests her yet. Forcing her to participate in something she doesn't want to do could harm her intrinsic motivation and self-esteem.\n\nAlso, the parents are using guilt-tripping phrases like \"doing nothing isn't acceptable,\" which can make the child feel criticized. The daughter calling them controlling suggests that the approach is counterproductive. Maybe the parents need to step back, encourage without pressure, and let her explore at her own pace. \n\nIn conclusion, while the parents' intentions are good, their method of pressuring Ellie to excel in something she hasn't chosen might be the issue. They might be in the wrong for not respecting her autonomy and current disinterest. So the answer would be A.\n"
