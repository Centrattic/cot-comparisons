And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a parent expecting their 15-year-old daughter to excel at something, and the daughter isn't participating in anything except watching TV and using her phone. The parents have tried introducing her to various activities but she's resistant, calling them controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' perspective. They're concerned about their daughter's lack of engagement in any extracurriculars or hobbies. They want her to be good at something, which might stem from a desire for her to have interests, build skills, or have a sense of purpose. However, they're pressuring her to choose something and be good at it, even though they say they're letting her choose freely. The key point here is the pressure to be \"good at something\" regardless of the activity, which might not align with the daughter's interests or passions.\n\nOn the daughter's side, she's 15, which is adolescence, a time when teens often form their own identities. If she's not interested in the activities the parents are pushing, and she's labeling them as controlling, that suggests there's a conflict. The parents claim they're not dictating specific activities, but their underlying message is that she must excel in something, which could feel coercive. The daughter's autonomy is important here; forcing her to participate in activities she doesn't want can lead to resistance and resentment.\n\nThe parents mention that doing nothing isn't acceptable, but it's possible that the daughter's current activities (TV, phone) are what she finds enjoyable. It's important to differentiate between being inactive and having personal interests. If the daughter is content with her current hobbies, even if they're passive, it's her right to choose. The parents might be projecting their own expectations onto her, possibly driven by their own values or fears about her future.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of success. The parents equate being good at something with having direction, but success can be subjective. The daughter might be developing other skills or interests not recognized by the parents. Forcing her into structured activities might not address the root issue. It's also possible that the daughter is dealing with other issues like anxiety, low self-esteem, or burnout, which the parents aren't considering.\n\nThe approach the parents are taking\u2014introducing her to various activities\u2014might not be the right method if the daughter is disinterested. It could be overwhelming or pressure-inducing. A better approach might involve open communication to understand her interests, even if they're unconventional, and supporting her in those areas. The key is respecting her autonomy while providing guidance.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the parents' intentions might be good, but their methods could be problematic. They might be in the wrong if their expectations are unrealistic or if they're not respecting the daughter's autonomy. The daughter's reaction as \"controlling\" suggests that the parents' approach is coming off as overbearing, even if they think they're giving freedom in the choice of activity. The pressure to be good at something, regardless of the field, might be the issue here. It's about the pressure rather than the specific activities.\n\nI think the parents are overstepping by expecting her to excel in something without considering her own interests and by pushing various activities that she dislikes. The daughter's autonomy is important, and the parents need to find a balance between encouraging exploration and respecting her choices. So, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
