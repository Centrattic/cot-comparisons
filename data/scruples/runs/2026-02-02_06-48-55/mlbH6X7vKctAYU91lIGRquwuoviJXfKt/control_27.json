And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for expecting their daughter to be good at something. The daughter is 15, and the parents are concerned she's not into anything, just watching Netflix and on her phone. They've tried introducing her to various activities but she's resistant and called them controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the parents' expectations are reasonable. They want her to have a hobby or interest where she can excel, but they're not pushing a specific activity. They're letting her choose, but she's not engaging. The parents feel doing nothing is a problem.\n\nOn one hand, encouraging a child to find passions and develop skills is common. Parents often want their kids to have direction and hobbies. But on the other hand, pressuring a teenager might not be effective. At 15, teens are exploring their identities, and forcing them could lead to resistance. The daughter feels controlled, which might be valid if she's being pushed to commit to things without her own choice.\n\nThe parents say they're not dictating what she does, just expecting her to do something. But the daughter might feel pressured to choose something and excel, which could be overwhelming. The line between encouragement and pressure is thin here. If the parents are making her feel like she must be good at something, that might be too much. Also, her current activities are passive (TV and phone), which the parents find concerning. However, it's her free time; maybe she's just not interested in any structured activities yet.\n\nAnother angle: the daughter's perspective. At 15, she might not have found her passion yet. It's a common phase where teens try different things. The parents' approach of introducing many options might be too much or not allowing her to naturally discover interests. The daughter's reaction of calling them controlling suggests she feels they're not respecting her autonomy.\n\nSo, the parents have valid concerns about their daughter's directionlessness, but their approach might be too prescriptive. They might be in the wrong if they're expecting her to be \"good at something\" without considering her own timeline and interests. The key issue is the pressure versus support. If they're forcing her to choose and perform, that's problematic. But if they're providing opportunities and encouraging exploration, that's reasonable. However, the daughter's resistance indicates a disconnect. The answer likely leans towards A, as the parents might be imposing their expectations without enough consideration of the daughter's autonomy and personal interests.\n"
