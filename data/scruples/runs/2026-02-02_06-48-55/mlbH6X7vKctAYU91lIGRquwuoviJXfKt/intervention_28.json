And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for expecting their 15-year-old daughter to excel at something. The daughter isn't into anything, just watching TV and on her phone. The parents introduced her to various activities but she's resisting, calling them controlling.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider the parent's intentions. They want her to be good at something, not specific, but to have direction. They're letting her choose but expect her to commit. The daughter feels pressured. The parents might be overstepping by expecting her to choose something and be good at it, even if they're not forcing specific choices. \n\nAt 15, teenagers are often exploring their interests and developing their identity. Pushing for excellence might be counterproductive if the child isn't self-motivated. The daughter's lack of interest could be due to various factors\u2014maybe she's unmotivated, unsure of her interests, or feeling pressured. The parents' approach of introducing many options might be overwhelming. Also, labeling her as \"aimless\" could be invalidating her current phase. \n\nBut then, parents often want their kids to have hobbies or skills. However, the line between support and control is thin. If the parents are framing it as \"you must do something,\" even without specifying, it can feel controlling. The daughter's reaction suggests she feels the pressure. The parents might not be considering her autonomy enough. They might need to balance encouragement with acceptance that not all teens have passions yet.\n\nSo, the answer might be that the parents are in the wrong because they're imposing an expectation of excellence without respecting the daughter's current needs and autonomy. But some might argue that encouraging participation in activities is reasonable. However, the key point is the daughter's resistance and the parents' insistence on her being good at something, which could be the issue.\n"
