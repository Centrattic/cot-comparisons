And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted this AITA (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong. The situation is about their daughter, Ellie, who's 15. The parents are upset because she's not into anything\u2014average grades, doesn't do anything at home except watch Netflix and be on her phone. They want her to be good at something, so they've tried introducing her to sports, art, instruments, etc., but she's resistant and even called them controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate if the parents are wrong. The key points here are the parents' expectations versus Ellie's autonomy. The parents are pushing for Ellie to find something she's good at, but they're not forcing her to choose something specific. They're giving her options but want her to commit to something. However, Ellie feels pressured and labels them as controlling.\n\nIn many parenting discussions, it's important to respect a teenager's autonomy. While it's natural for parents to want their children to have interests and activities, pushing too hard can backfire. The parents might be projecting their own desires onto Ellie, thinking that having a hobby or talent is essential. But Ellie is at an age where she's forming her own identity, and her resistance could be a sign of needing more independence.\n\nThe parents mention they're not forcing specific activities but still require her to be good at something. That might come across as pressure, even if they see it as support. The line between encouragement and control can be thin. If Ellie feels coerced, even when options are presented, it might be the parents' approach that's problematic.\n\nAlso, considering developmental psychology, teenagers often explore and may not have a clear passion yet. The parents' frustration is valid, but their methods might not be the right approach. The daughter's reaction of labeling them as controlling suggests that their approach is making her feel her autonomy is being undermined.\n\nSo, while the parents' intention is to help their daughter, their method might be overstepping. The answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because they're imposing expectations under the guise of support, which could be harmful to the daughter's sense of autonomy and self-identity. However, I need to make sure that the parents aren't entirely wrong. If they're providing opportunities without enforcing specific outcomes, maybe it's a middle ground. But since the daughter feels controlled, the parents might not be considering her perspective adequately. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
