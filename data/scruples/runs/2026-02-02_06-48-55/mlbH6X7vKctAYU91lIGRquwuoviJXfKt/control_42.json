And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for expecting their daughter to be good at something. The parent's daughter, Ellie, is 15 and not into anything. The parents are pushing her to get involved in something, but she's resisting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' perspective. They're concerned about Ellie not having hobbies or interests, and they want her to be good at something. They've tried introducing various activities but she's not interested and called them controlling. The parents say they're not forcing specific activities but want her to choose something and excel. Their reasoning is that being aimless isn't acceptable.\n\nFrom a parenting standpoint, encouraging a child to find interests and develop skills is common. However, the line between encouragement and pressure can be thin. The parents might be overstepping if they're making Ellie feel like she has to meet their expectations, especially if she's not interested in any of the suggested activities. The daughter's reaction (\"controlling\") suggests she feels pressured, which the parents claim they aren't doing. But their actions\u2014introducing her to everything\u2014might be perceived as pushy.\n\nAlso, at 15, Ellie is in a stage where autonomy is important. Forcing or even strongly suggesting she do something could lead to resentment. The parents might not be considering her genuine interests but instead want her to be \"good at something,\" which is a bit vague. It's possible they're projecting their own values or societal pressures onto her.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents are concerned about her not being engaged in anything, which could have long-term implications for her development. However, the method they're using might not be effective. Instead of pushing her to be good at something, they might need to support her in finding her own passions, even if it's not something they consider \"good\" or traditional.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the parents might be in the wrong if they're not respecting Ellie's autonomy and her current interests. The key is whether they're pressuring her to meet their standards rather than supporting her self-discovery. So, Answer A would be correct if they are in the wrong, and B if not. Given the daughter's resistance and the parents' insistence on her being good at something regardless of her interests, it's leaning towards A.\n"
