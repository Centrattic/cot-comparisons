And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is whether expecting their daughter to be good at something is unreasonable. The parents are concerned because their 15-year-old, Ellie, isn't into anything\u2014average grades, not involved in clubs, sports, arts, etc. They've tried introducing her to various activities, but she resists and calls them controlling. The parents argue they're not forcing specific interests but want her to find something she's good at, as they think doing nothing is unacceptable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what's reasonable for a teenager. At 15, some kids might not have found their passion yet. It's possible Ellie is still exploring. But the parents are pushing her to be \"the best\" or at least good at something, which might be too much. They're offering options but expecting her to commit, which could be stressful. The line between support and pressure is thin here. \n\nThe parents say they're not controlling, but Ellie perceives them that way. If they're introducing her to many activities without letting her set her own pace, that could feel overwhelming. Also, focusing on being \"good\" might create anxiety instead of genuine interest. It's important for a teenager to have autonomy in developing their own interests. \n\nOn the other hand, the parents have valid concerns about Ellie's lack of engagement. However, their approach might be the issue. Maybe they should provide more support in helping her discover her own interests rather than pushing for excellence. The key is whether their expectations are realistic and respectful of her individuality. If they're pressuring her to excel without her choosing the activity herself, that could be the problem. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because their expectations and approach might be too controlling, even if their intentions are good. The emphasis on being \"the best\" and the reaction to her resistance could be the issue.\n"
