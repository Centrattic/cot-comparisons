And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author (a parent) is in the wrong for expecting their 15-year-old daughter, Ellie, to be good at something. The parent is concerned that Ellie isn't into anything, her grades are average, and she does nothing but watch Netflix and use her phone. They've tried introducing her to various activities but she resists and called them controlling. The parents argue they're not forcing specific interests but want her to find something and excel at it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. They might feel that being involved in activities is important for a teenager's development, providing structure, skills, and a sense of accomplishment. Their intention could be to help Ellie build a resume, develop hobbies, or have something to be proud of. They mention not controlling her but wanting her to choose something and be good at it. \n\nOn the other hand, Ellie is 15, an adolescent, and this is a time when teens often seek independence. Forcing or pushing her too hard might backfire, causing resistance and resentment. The daughter feels her parents are controlling, which suggests there's a communication issue or mismatch in expectations. The parents might not realize that the pressure to be \"good at something\" could be stifling her autonomy. Also, average grades and a lack of interest in activities don't necessarily mean something is wrong; some people find their passions later or in different ways.\n\nI should also think about the daughter's perspective. At 15, she's still figuring out her identity. If she's not being forced into specific activities but feels pressured to choose something she's good at, it might create stress. The key here is whether the parents are respecting her autonomy while encouraging exploration. If they're pushing for excellence without considering her interests or allowing her time to explore, that could be problematic.\n\nAnother angle: the parents are trying to introduce her to various activities, which is positive, but if she's not interested, maybe they need to adjust their approach. Maybe they should focus on supporting her in whatever interests she does have, even if they're not traditional. For example, if she's into something like technology, gaming, or creative writing online, but the parents aren't considering those as valid. Alternatively, maybe Ellie isn't into any of the suggested activities because they don't align with her actual interests.\n\nThe term \"being good at something\" might be too vague. The parents might have their own definitions of what counts as \"good,\" which might not align with Ellie's. It's possible that Ellie is interested in something that the parents don't recognize or value. Also, expecting excellence at 15 might be unrealistic; some people take longer to develop skills.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the parents might be overstepping by imposing their expectations, especially since Ellie is a teenager who needs space to explore her own path. The parents' approach might be well-intentioned, but the method could be causing conflict. They might need to balance encouragement with respect for her autonomy, allowing her to find her own interests without pressure to excel.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the answer leans towards the parents being in the wrong (A) because they are exerting pressure for their daughter to excel in something without considering her autonomy and interests, which could be causing the conflict. However, there's a middle ground where parents encourage exploration without enforcing success. The key issue is the pressure to be \"good\" rather than supporting her in whatever she chooses to pursue, even if it's not traditional.\n"
