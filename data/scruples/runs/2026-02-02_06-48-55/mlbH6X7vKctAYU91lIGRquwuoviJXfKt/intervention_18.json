And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The parent is asking if they're at fault for expecting their 15-year-old daughter to excel in some area. The daughter isn't involved in anything and just watches TV or uses her phone. The parents have tried introducing various activities but the daughter resists and labels them as controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' intent. They mention they want her to be good at something, not pushing for a specific thing. So they're giving her choices. But the daughter feels controlled. There's a tension here between the parents' desire for their child to have direction and the daughter's autonomy.\n\nAdolescence is a time when teens often seek independence. The daughter calling them controlling suggests a conflict in perceived control versus actual support. The parents might think they're facilitating opportunities, but the approach could come across as pressuring. Even if they're offering choices, the underlying expectation of \"being good at something\" might be causing stress. \n\nAlso, expecting kids to excel in something could be problematic. Not every teenager will find their passion or talent. The parents might be imposing their own values or fears about their child's future. It's important to recognize that some people develop interests later, or may not prioritize hobbies in the same way. \n\nThe parents' motivation is concern about their daughter's aimlessness. However, pushing for her to be good at something might not address the root issues. Maybe Ellie is going through a phase where she's not interested in traditional activities, and the parents are not giving her space to explore at her own pace. \n\nIn terms of ethics, is it wrong to want your child to have interests and achievements? It can be, if it's coming from a place of control rather than support. The key is whether the parents are respecting their daughter's autonomy versus pushing their own agenda. If they're forcing her to choose something she's not interested in, even with options, that could be seen as wrong. \n\nBut the parents are also trying to guide her away from what they see as a lack of direction. There's a balance between encouraging exploration and respecting her current disinterest. The answer might depend on cultural or societal values too. Some might argue that having a hobby or skill is beneficial, while others might prioritize the child's happiness and choice.\n\nIn summary, while the parents' concern is understandable, their approach might be infringing on the daughter's autonomy. The \"wrong\" here could be the imposition of expectations without considering her current feelings and the pressure to excel rather than just participate. So, the author might be in the wrong if their methods are too controlling despite presenting choices.\n"
