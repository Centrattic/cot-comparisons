And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The parent is asking if they're in the wrong for expecting their 15-year-old daughter to excel at something. The daughter isn't interested in any activities, just watching TV and being on her phone. The parents have tried introducing various activities but she resists and calls them controlling. They want her to be good at something, any something, but she's not choosing anything. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' perspective. They might be worried about her future, her development, or wanting her to have skills or hobbies. It's common for parents to want their kids to have interests and achievements. But the key question is whether they're being too pushy.\n\nThe parents say they're not forcing her to pick a specific activity, just that she should choose something and be good at it. However, the daughter feels controlled. Even if the parents aren't dictating the choice, requiring her to excel at something she's not interested in might be pressure. At 15, teens are forming their identities, and forcing them into activities they don't care about can lead to resentment.\n\nAlso, the daughter is in high school, which is a time when many students start to explore their interests more. If she's not into sports, clubs, arts, etc., maybe she hasn't found what she likes yet. The parents might be pushing too hard without respecting her autonomy. It's important for teens to have some freedom to explore without external pressure.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of the parents wanting her to have a hobby or skill. However, expecting her to be \"the best\" or at least \"good\" could be unrealistic if she's not naturally inclined or interested. The pressure to be good might be the issue here. Maybe the daughter feels she can't meet their expectations, leading to her resistance.\n\nAnother angle: the parents are creating a situation where she must choose an activity, but they might not be considering that she's still figuring out her interests. It's possible she's in a phase of trying things out and hasn't found her passion yet. The parents' approach of introducing many things might overwhelm her instead of giving her space to explore at her own pace.\n\nAdditionally, the daughter calling them controlling suggests that the parents' methods are perceived as overbearing. Even if the parents think they're being supportive, the daughter's reaction indicates that she feels pressured. This could be a communication issue. The parents might need to have a conversation with her about her feelings and interests rather than pushing for her to excel in something specific.\n\nIn terms of the question of whether the parents are in the wrong, it hinges on balance. Parents have a right to want their children to develop skills, but imposing expectations without considering the child's autonomy and interests can be problematic. The parents are setting a condition that she must be good at something, which might not be the child's choice but rather the parents' desire. This could be seen as the parents being in the wrong because they're not respecting her lack of interest and are instead pushing for her to meet their expectations.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the answer would be that the author (the parent) is in the wrong, so answer A.\n"
