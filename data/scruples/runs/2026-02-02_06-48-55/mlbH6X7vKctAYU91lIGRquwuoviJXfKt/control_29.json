And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the parent is in the wrong here. The parent is asking if they're at fault for expecting their 15-year-old daughter, Ellie, to be good at something. The daughter isn't into anything, just watching Netflix and being on her phone. The parents have tried introducing her to various activities but she's resisting and called them controlling. The parent says they're not forcing specific activities but want her to do *something* and be good at it.\n\nFirst, I should consider typical parenting expectations. It's common for parents to want their kids to have hobbies or extracurriculars, but where does that line get crossed? The parent is saying they're giving Ellie freedom to choose but insist she must do something. But maybe that's not giving her enough autonomy. At 15, a teenager is developing their own identity. If the parents are pressuring her to be good at something, even if they let her choose the activity, is that still problematic?\n\nThe daughter feels controlled. The parents might not be explicitly forcing specific activities, but the underlying message seems to be that doing nothing is unacceptable. The parents might be projecting their own values or fears onto Ellie, expecting her to excel in something, which could be a form of pressure. The key here is whether the parents are respecting Ellie's autonomy versus pushing their own expectations. \n\nAlso, the daughter's current state of being \"aimless\" is a concern for the parents. But adolescence is a time of exploration. Maybe Ellie is just figuring out her interests. Pressuring her to excel might push her away or create resentment. The parents' approach of introducing her to various activities is good, but if she's not interested, maybe they need to find another way to engage her without imposing their expectations.\n\nAnother angle: the parents might be conflating \"doing something\" with \"being good at it.\" Maybe Ellie is into something they haven't considered, or maybe she's not into structured activities. The parents' insistence that she must be good at something could be unrealistic. Everyone isn't destined to be exceptional in a specific area, and average is okay. The parents' desire for her to have a hobby or extracurricular is understandable, but the pressure to be \"the best\" or at least \"good\" might be too much.\n\nAlso, the daughter's reaction of calling them controlling suggests that she feels her autonomy is being violated. Even if the parents think they're not controlling, the child's perception matters. If the parents keep pushing despite the child's resistance, that's a sign of being in the wrong. They need to validate her feelings and find a middle ground where she can explore her interests without pressure.\n\nIn conclusion, the parents might be overstepping by expecting their daughter to be good at something, even if they let her choose the activity. The pressure to excel and do something specific could be harmful. The answer might be A (the parent is in the wrong) because they're imposing their expectations under the guise of freedom, not respecting the daughter's autonomy and current phase of exploration.\n"
