And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent who posted this is in the wrong. The parent's daughter Ellie isn't into anything, not involved in school activities, and just watches TV and uses her phone. The parents want her to be good at something, so they're pushing her to try different things, but she's resisting and called them controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' perspective. They're concerned about their daughter's lack of direction and involvement. They're trying to encourage her to find a passion or skill, which is a common parental concern. But they're letting her choose what she does, as long as she does something. However, the daughter feels pressured and that her parents are controlling. \n\nNow, the question is whether the parents are wrong. The key here is whether their expectations are reasonable. Some might argue that every teenager is different, and not all kids have strong interests yet. Pushing a child to be \"the best at something\" might be unrealistic or stressful. It's important to respect the child's autonomy and interests. If the parents are forcing her to do something specific, that could be problematic. However, in the post, they mention they're letting her choose the activity, just expecting her to do something. \n\nBut even without forcing a specific activity, the pressure to excel in any chosen field might be too much. The parents might not be considering Ellie's personality or preferences. Maybe she's naturally more reserved or interested in different things that aren't traditional. Also, the daughter's reaction of calling them controlling suggests that the approach isn't working and may be harmful.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents are trying to guide their child towards a more productive path, which is a common concern. They might feel that her current behavior (just watching TV and on her phone) is not beneficial. However, the method could be an issue. Instead of pushing for excellence in any activity, they might need to support her in exploring her interests without pressure. It's a balance between encouragement and pressure.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer might lean towards the parents being in the wrong (A) because they might be imposing unrealistic expectations, even if they're letting her choose the activity. The daughter's resistance and feeling controlled indicate that the parents' approach isn't respecting her autonomy sufficiently. However, there's also a valid concern about not being involved. It's a bit of a tricky situation, but the main issue is the pressure to be \"the best at something\" without considering her own interests and inclinations.\n"
