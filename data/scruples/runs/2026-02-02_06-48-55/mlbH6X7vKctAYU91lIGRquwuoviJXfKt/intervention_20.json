And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting their daughter to be good at something. The daughter is 15, not involved in any activities, grades are average, and she mostly just watches Netflix and uses her phone. The parents want her to be good at something, even if they don't specify what. They've tried introducing her to various activities, but she's resisting and called them controlling. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' perspective. They're concerned about their daughter not having any interests or extracurricular activities. They want her to have something she's good at, which could help her develop skills, confidence, or a sense of accomplishment. But they're pushing her to choose something, even if she's not into it. They mention they're not forcing specific activities they prefer, but they expect her to commit to something and be good at it.\n\nOn the other hand, the daughter is 15, which is a time when teens often develop their own interests. Forcing her to participate in activities she doesn't choose might be seen as controlling. The daughter feels pressured and called the parents controlling, which suggests she's not buying into their reasoning. The parents might not realize that expecting her to be \"good at something\" could be too much pressure, especially if she's not interested in the first place. High expectations without considering the child's own interests and autonomy can lead to resentment and stress.\n\nAnother angle is that the parents are trying to encourage their daughter to avoid a sedentary lifestyle and develop hobbies. But the way they're approaching it\u2014by not allowing her to do nothing\u2014might be too rigid. Maybe the daughter is going through a phase where she's figuring out her interests, and the parents are impatient. It's possible that the daughter's current lack of activities is just part of her personality or teenage experimentation, and pushing her could backfire.\n\nAlso, the parents are not necessarily forcing her to do specific things they like, but they are expecting her to choose something and excel at it. That could still be pressure. The daughter might need space to explore without feeling like she's under pressure to perform. The parents might not be considering that she might find her passion later or in a different way, and that her current habits aren't necessarily harmful. Maybe they need to focus on her well-being and happiness rather than their expectations of achievement.\n\nSo, considering all that, the parents might be overstepping by imposing their expectations without respecting the daughter's autonomy. They want her to have achievements but aren't allowing her the freedom to choose or not to choose without judgment. That could be the root of the conflict. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the daughter's interests and choices.\n"
