And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The parent, who is either the mother or the wife, is concerned about their 15-year-old daughter Ellie who isn't really into anything. She's average in school, doesn't participate in clubs, sports, arts, etc., and just watches Netflix and uses her phone. The parents want her to be good at something, so they've tried introducing her to various activities. But Ellie feels controlled and is resisting.\n\nFirst, I should consider the parents' perspective. They want their daughter to have interests and be involved, which is a common concern. Parents often want their kids to develop skills and hobbies, thinking it's good for their growth. They mention they're letting her choose what she does, as long as she does something and is good at it. But Ellie is calling them controlling. That's a key point. If the parents are pressuring her to choose something and be good at it, even if she's choosing the activity, she might feel the pressure to succeed, not just to participate.\n\nThen, looking at Ellie's side. At 15, she's a teenager, which is a time when many kids are exploring their identities and interests. If the parents are pushing for her to be good at something, maybe she's feeling that there's an expectation that isn't being met. The fact that she's not into anything could be due to various reasons: maybe she hasn't found something she's passionate about yet, or maybe she's dealing with social anxiety or other issues that aren't mentioned here. The parents might be overlooking that she's in a phase where she's not motivated, and their constant pushing might be causing stress.\n\nThe parents say they're not forcing specific activities but want her to choose something. However, the pressure to be \"good at something\" might be the issue. Even if they're not dictating what she does, the underlying message that she must excel in any chosen activity could be the problem. It's possible that Ellie feels the pressure to perform, which could backfire if she's not intrinsically motivated. The phrase \"as long as she does something and is good at it\" implies that just participating isn't enough; she needs to be good, which adds performance pressure.\n\nAnother angle is the parents' own expectations. They might have their own standards or fears about their child's future, leading them to push for achievements. However, every child is different. Some kids thrive in structured activities, while others need more time to find their interests. The parents might not be respecting Ellie's pace or her possible lack of interest in traditional \"good at something\" areas.\n\nAlso, the parents' approach of introducing her to everything might be overwhelming. Trying out a variety of activities without allowing time to commit to one could lead to burnout or disinterest. It's possible that Ellie is feeling overwhelmed by the constant introduction of new activities and the expectation to excel in them, hence the feeling of being controlled.\n\nIn terms of parenting advice, often it's recommended to encourage exploration without pressure, allowing the child to find their own interests. Pushing for excellence might stifle creativity or natural inclination. The parents are trying to steer Ellie towards being involved but might not be giving her the autonomy to find her own path without the performance pressure.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents have valid concerns. They want their child to be engaged and not idle. But their method might be the problem. They might need to shift from expecting excellence to supporting her in any interests she does develop, even if she's not the best. It's about balance between encouragement and pressure.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the parents' intention is good\u2014they want their child to be involved and successful. However, their approach, especially the emphasis on being \"good at something,\" might be pressuring Ellie in a way that's counterproductive. The key question is whether the parents are in the wrong for expecting her to excel in something. The answer hinges on how they're enforcing this and if their expectations are realistic and supportive.\n"
