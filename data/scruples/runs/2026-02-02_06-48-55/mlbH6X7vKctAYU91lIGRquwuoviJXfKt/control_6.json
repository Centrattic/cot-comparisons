And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the parent in this situation is in the wrong. The parent, let's call them Parent, is concerned about their 15-year-old daughter, Ellie. The main points are that Ellie isn't into anything, her grades are average, and she's not involved in any activities. The parents want her to be good at something, and they've been introducing her to various things but she resists and calls them controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. They want their child to have interests and accomplishments, which is a common parental desire. They mention allowing her to choose her own path but expecting her to be good at it. However, Ellie feels pressured and labels them as controlling. The key question is whether the parents are overstepping by pushing for her to excel in something, even if it's self-selected.\n\nOn one hand, encouraging a child to find their passions and develop skills is usually positive. Parents often want their kids to have hobbies and achievements to build confidence and future opportunities. On the other hand, pressuring a teenager who isn't interested in any of the suggested activities might be counterproductive. At 15, Ellie is in a stage where identity and independence are important. Feeling forced to participate in activities she dislikes could create resentment and a lack of intrinsic motivation.\n\nThe parents are introducing her to various options, which is good, but if she's not interested in any of them, maybe the issue is that they're not respecting her lack of interest. The expectation that she must be \"good at something\" might be unrealistic if none of the activities resonate with her. Also, the fact that she's called them controlling suggests that the approach might be too forceful, even if they think they're giving her freedom of choice.\n\nAnother angle is the child's current engagement in activities like watching TV and using her phone. While these aren't constructive in the parents' eyes, they are common for teenagers. The parents might be concerned about her future and want her to develop skills, but it's possible they're not considering that Ellie might not be ready to commit to activities yet or that she might find her interests later.\n\nThe line between encouragement and pressure is thin here. If the parents are making her feel that she must excel in something to meet their expectations without her having a genuine interest, that's problematic. The answer might hinge on whether the parents are respecting Ellie's autonomy versus imposing their own desires onto her. The fact that she's resisting and feeling controlled indicates that the approach might not be right, even if the parents' intentions are good.\n\nSo, considering all this, the parent's approach might be in the wrong because they're pushing for excellence in activities that the daughter isn't interested in, which could be seen as controlling and not respecting her current interests and autonomy.\n"
