And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for expecting their 15-year-old daughter to be good at something. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the parent mentions Ellie isn't into anything, her grades are average, and she does nothing at home except watch TV and use her phone. They want her to be good at something, regardless of what it is. They've tried introducing her to various activities but she's resistant and called them controlling. The parent feels they're not being controlling but rather encouraging her to find a passion.\n\nHmm. From a psychological standpoint, adolescence is a time when teens explore their identities. Forcing a child to excel in something they aren't interested in might backfire, leading to resentment or anxiety. The parent's concern is valid\u2014they want their child to have direction and interests. But the approach seems to be pushing her towards being good at something, maybe without considering her intrinsic motivation.\n\nThe parent says they're letting her choose anything, but the underlying expectation is that she must be good at it. That pressure could be the issue. It's not about the choice of activity but the necessity to excel. The daughter's reaction of feeling controlled suggests that the parent's expectations might be too rigid, even if they're framed as options.\n\nI remember reading about the importance of autonomy in adolescents. If the parent is imposing an unspoken rule that she must pursue and excel in an activity, that's a form of control. It's possible the parent is projecting their own desires onto Ellie, wanting her to have achievements, but not respecting her autonomy in choosing her path. \n\nOn the other hand, the parent's intent is to help their child avoid being aimless, which is understandable. However, the method\u2014expecting excellence in something chosen by the child but under parental influence\u2014might not be the right approach. The daughter might need space to discover her own interests without the pressure of excelling for her parents' approval.\n\nIn conclusion, the parent is likely in the wrong because their approach is pressuring the daughter to meet their expectations rather than supporting her self-directed exploration. The daughter's feelings of being controlled validate that the approach is problematic, even if the parent's intentions are good.\n"
