And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The parent is asking if they're in the wrong for expecting their 15-year-old daughter, Ellie, to be good at something. The daughter isn't involved in any activities, and the parents are pushing her to find something she's into. They've tried introducing various options but she resists and calls them controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' intentions. They want Ellie to have interests and hobbies, which is a common parental desire to see their kids engaged and developing skills. However, the way they're approaching it might be an issue. They mention that Ellie isn't into anything, but the parents are pressuring her to be good at something, even though the specific activity doesn't matter. The key question here is whether the pressure is appropriate or if it's crossing into being controlling.\n\nThe parents say they're not forcing her to choose the same activities as them, but they still expect her to be good at something. This could be problematic because it's possible that the pressure itself is making Ellie feel controlled. Even if the parents are offering choices, the underlying expectation that she must excel at something might be too much for her. Adolescents at 15 are often exploring their identities and may not have found their passion yet. Pushing them to excel might stifle their natural curiosity and cause resistance.\n\nAlso, the daughter is calling them controlling. Even if the parents think they're not being overbearing, the perception from Ellie's side matters. It's possible that the constant introduction to activities and the emphasis on being good at something are making her feel pressured, hence the label of controlling. The parents might not realize that their well-intentioned efforts are causing the daughter to push back.\n\nAnother aspect is the daughter's behavior. She's not involved in anything, which the parents find concerning. But maybe there's an underlying reason for her disinterest that the parents aren't considering. For example, anxiety, lack of interest in traditional activities, or different strengths that aren't being tapped into. The parents might need to have a conversation with Ellie to understand her perspective rather than just pushing for her to excel in something.\n\nIn terms of the parents' approach, while their concern is valid, their method could be the issue. Instead of focusing on her being good at something, maybe they should focus on supporting her in exploring different interests without the pressure of excelling. It's possible that the pressure is leading to the daughter's resistance, making her more disengaged.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the parents might be in the wrong because their approach, though coming from a place of wanting the best for their daughter, is likely causing the daughter to feel controlled and resistant. The emphasis on being good at something might not align with the daughter's current needs or interests, and the method of introducing various activities could be overwhelming or coercive, even if unintended.\n"
