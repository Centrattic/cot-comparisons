And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for expecting their 15-year-old daughter to excel in something. The parent mentions that Ellie isn't into anything, has average grades, and spends a lot of time on Netflix and her phone. They want her to be good at something, even if it's not specific, and have tried introducing various activities, but she's resistant and called them controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. They might feel concerned about Ellie's future, worried that without developing skills or interests, she might not reach her potential. Their approach is to encourage her to engage in activities, which is common for parents who want their kids to be well-rounded. However, the parent is emphasizing that she needs to be \"good at something,\" which could create pressure. \n\nNow, looking at Ellie's side. At 15, teens often struggle with identity and autonomy. Being pushed to excel might lead to resistance, especially if the parent's expectations don't align with her interests. The parent says they're not forcing specific activities but want her to choose something she's good at. However, the underlying message of \"you must be good at something\" might be the issue. It's possible that Ellie isn't interested in the activities they're offering or feels overwhelmed by the pressure to perform.\n\nThe parent mentions Ellie called them controlling. Even if they're not being overtly restrictive, the pressure to achieve could feel controlling. The key here is the balance between encouragement and pressure. While it's reasonable for parents to want their child to have hobbies and interests, imposing an expectation of excellence might be too much. \n\nAnother angle is the daughter's current state\u2014she's average in school and not involved. Parents might see this as a lack of direction, but it's also possible she's exploring or hasn't found her passion yet. Pushing for excellence without understanding her interests could lead to burnout or resentment. \n\nIn terms of cultural context, some cultures emphasize achievement highly, while others value personal happiness. However, the question is more about whether the parent's expectations are unreasonable. The parent isn't dictating what she should do, but the insistence on being \"good at something\" might not respect her autonomy. \n\nAlso, the parent's approach of introducing many activities might be overwhelming. Maybe Ellie is trying them out but hasn't found her niche yet. The parent's frustration is valid, but their method might be counterproductive. The daughter's reaction suggests that she feels the pressure is too much, which could mean the parent is overstepping.\n\nIn conclusion, while the parents have good intentions, their approach might be causing the daughter stress and pushing her away. The expectation of being good at something could be the root of the problem. So, the answer would be A (the parent is in the wrong) because they're imposing pressure that's affecting the daughter negatively, even if their intentions are good.\n"
