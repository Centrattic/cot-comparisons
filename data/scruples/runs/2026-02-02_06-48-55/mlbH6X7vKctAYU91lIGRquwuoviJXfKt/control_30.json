And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person (the parent) is in the wrong for expecting their daughter to be good at something. The situation is that their 15-year-old daughter isn't into anything\u2014average grades, not involved in any activities, just watching TV and on her phone. The parents want her to be good at something, regardless of what it is, and they've tried introducing various activities but she resists and calls them controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' perspective. They might be concerned about their daughter not having hobbies or interests, which could affect her future opportunities or self-esteem. They want her to excel in something, which could be seen as a desire for her to have direction and skills. However, their approach might be pushing too hard, leading the daughter to feel pressured or controlled, even if the parents aren't explicitly forcing specific choices.\n\nOn the other hand, the daughter's reaction\u2014calling them controlling\u2014suggests that she feels her autonomy is being invaded. At 15, teenagers are often exploring their identities, and too much pressure from parents might lead to resistance. The parents are allowing her to choose the activity but are emphasizing the need to be good at it. That might still feel like a demand for success rather than genuine interest exploration.\n\nI should also consider if expecting a teenager to be \"the best\" is realistic or healthy. It could lead to stress or burnout for the daughter. The parents might be projecting their own expectations onto her, which isn't fair. The key point is whether the parents are respecting their daughter's autonomy versus pushing their own desires onto her.\n\nIn terms of societal perspectives, some might argue that parents should encourage their children to find their passions without imposing performance expectations. Others might think that having some involvement is important for development. The line between support and control can be blurry here. The parents might not be in the wrong if their intention is to help her discover interests, but if they're prioritizing their own expectations over her happiness, that could be problematic.\n\nThe daughter's response indicates that the current approach isn't working. The parents need to balance encouragement with respecting her choices. Maybe the issue isn't the desire for her to have interests but the way it's being enforced. The answer could hinge on whether the parents are being overbearing or if they're genuinely trying to support her exploration without pressure.\n"
