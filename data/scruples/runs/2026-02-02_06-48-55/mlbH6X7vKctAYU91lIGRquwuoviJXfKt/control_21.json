And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for expecting their daughter to be good at something. So the parent's daughter is 15, not into anything, average grades, and spends a lot of time on her phone and watching TV. The parents want her to be good at something, so they've tried introducing her to various activities but she's resisting and calling them controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' perspective. They're concerned about their daughter being \"aimless\" and not having hobbies. It's common for parents to want their children to have interests or talents, maybe to build confidence or have something to do. But the key here is how they're approaching it. They say they're letting her choose whatever she wants, as long as she's good at it. Wait, does that mean they're pressuring her to pick something and excel? If they're offering options but she's not interested, maybe they're not forcing her, but they're disappointed she's not choosing anything. \n\nNow, the daughter's side: she's 15, which is a teenage age where kids often push back against parental expectations. She might feel pressured even if the parents aren't being overtly controlling. The daughter might just prefer relaxing on her phone and shows no interest in the parents' suggestions. Maybe she's not interested in the activities they're offering. The parents are trying to introduce her to various things, but she's not engaging. \n\nThe parents are not forcing her to take up specific activities, so they're giving her freedom in choice, but they have an expectation that she should be \"good at something.\" So the question is whether expecting a teenager to have a hobby or talent is unreasonable. Some might argue that it's healthy to explore interests, and parents can encourage without pressure. But others might say that pressuring a teenager to excel in something can be harmful, especially if they're not interested. \n\nAlso, the daughter's current focus on TV and phone could be a sign of different priorities or maybe social media use common in that age group. The parents might be worried about her future or social development. However, expecting her to be \"the best\" or at least \"good\" at something could be adding stress. If the daughter is resistant and feels controlled, maybe the parents are overstepping by having such expectations.\n\nBut the parents are not forcing her; they're offering opportunities. So maybe they're not in the wrong. However, it's possible they're not respecting her autonomy if she's not interested. The line between encouragement and pressure can be thin. The daughter's reaction of calling them controlling might indicate that she feels pressured, even if they think they're not being controlling.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, it's common for parents to want their kids to have hobbies, but the approach matters. If they're pushing her to find something and ensuring she's good at it, but she's not engaging, maybe they need to back off and let her find her own path, even if it's different from what they expect. So, depending on the context, the answer could swing either way. \n\nThe parents might be in the right if they're providing opportunities and not forcing anything, but if their expectations are causing stress and the daughter feels controlled, then they might be in the wrong. The key is whether they're respecting her choices. Since the daughter isn't choosing anything and they're disappointed, maybe the problem is that the parents are imposing their own expectations (being good at something) rather than supporting her interests, even if they're different. \n\nSo, considering all this, I think the parents might be in the wrong because their expectations could be too high without considering their daughter's actual interests and preferences. They might be projecting their own desires onto her, which isn't healthy. Therefore, answer A (they are in the wrong). But wait, the parents are giving her options and letting her choose, so maybe they're not forcing her. Then again, expecting her to choose something and be good at it might be a form of pressure. It's a bit of a gray area, but leaning towards A.\n"
