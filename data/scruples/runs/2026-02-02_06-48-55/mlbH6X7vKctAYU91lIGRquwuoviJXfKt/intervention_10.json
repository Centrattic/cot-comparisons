And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for expecting their daughter to excel at something. The parent's daughter is 15, and they feel she's not into anything, just watching TV and on her phone. They've tried introducing her to various activities but she resists and calls them controlling. The parent argues they're not forcing her to do anything specific, just want her to choose something and be good at it.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the perspective of the parent. They might be worried about their daughter's future, feeling she needs direction or skills. But from the daughter's side, being pushed to participate in activities she doesn't enjoy could be stressful. The daughter might feel her autonomy is being invaded, even if the parents are presenting options. \n\nThe parent mentions they aren't dictating specific activities, just encouraging engagement. However, the pressure to be \"good at something\" might be implicit. Teens often go through phases of exploring interests, and not all are into clubs or sports. Maybe Ellie is just in a phase of not finding her passion yet. The parents' approach of introducing many activities might be overwhelming or not respecting her current lack of interest.\n\nAlso, the daughter calling them controlling suggests she feels pressured, even if the parents think they're being supportive. The line between guidance and control can be blurry. Expecting a teenager to excel at something might be unrealistic if they aren't naturally inclined or interested. The parents might be projecting their own values or fears onto their daughter.\n\nI should also consider cultural factors. In some cultures, academic or extracurricular excellence is highly valued, and parents might push their kids accordingly. But in others, personal interest and happiness are prioritized. The question is whether the parents' expectations are unreasonable. The daughter's well-being is important; forcing her into activities she doesn't enjoy could lead to resentment or burnout.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents might genuinely want the best for their daughter, fearing she's not developing necessary skills or social connections. They could be trying to help her find a path. But the method might be flawed. Maybe they need to step back, allow Ellie more time to explore at her own pace, or focus on finding activities that genuinely interest her rather than pushing a variety.\n\nIn conclusion, the parents' intentions might be good, but their approach could be too controlling. They might be in the wrong because they're imposing expectations without considering their daughter's autonomy and interests. However, there's a balance between guiding a teenager and respecting their individuality. The answer likely leans towards A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because the pressure to excel in any activity, regardless of the daughter's interests, could be harmful.\n"
