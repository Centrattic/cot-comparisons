And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's dive into this. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for expecting their 15-year-old daughter to be good at something. The parent mentions that Ellie isn't into anything, has average grades, and spends time on TV and her phone. They've tried introducing various activities but she's resistant and called them controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's intentions. They want Ellie to have a hobby or skill, which is a common parental desire. They don't force specific activities but want her to choose something and excel. However, the key issue is whether the parent is overstepping by expecting her to be \"the best\" or at least \"good.\" \n\nAt 15, teens are developing their identities. Pushing for excellence without considering Ellie's interests might be problematic. The parent's pressure could be contributing to her resistance. The line between support and control is thin here. The parent might be imposing their own values, like the importance of being good at something, without considering Ellie's autonomy. \n\nAlso, the parent's approach of introducing many activities might overwhelm her. It's possible she feels pressured to perform rather than explore. The parent's frustration is valid, but the method might be the issue. The daughter's reaction of calling them controlling suggests that the parent's approach isn't resonating with her. \n\nSo, while the parent's concern about Ellie's engagement is understandable, their method of expecting excellence without respecting her current disinterest or need for autonomy might be where they're in the wrong. The answer likely leans towards A (the author is in the wrong) because the pressure to excel without considering the child's interests and autonomy could be harmful.\n"
