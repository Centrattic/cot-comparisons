And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for expecting their 15-year-old daughter to be good at something. The parent mentions that Ellie isn't into anything, her grades are average, and she's not involved in any activities. They've tried introducing her to various things but she's resistant and called them controlling.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the parents' expectations versus Ellie's interests. The parents want her to excel in something, but they're not pushing her into a specific activity. They're giving her options but she's not choosing any. The daughter is a teenager, which is a time when kids often explore and find their interests. The parents might be worried about her lack of direction, which is understandable. But is it wrong to expect her to be good at something?\n\nI should consider the pressure they're putting on her. Even though they say they're not controlling, the fact that she's labeling them as such suggests there's some conflict. The parents might be projecting their own values or fears onto Ellie. Maybe they want her to have a hobby or extracurricular activity because they believe it's important for her development. However, forcing her to participate in something she's not interested in could backfire. It's possible that Ellie is still figuring out what she likes, and the parents are pushing too hard, making her resistant.\n\nOn the other hand, being a parent, they have a right to encourage their child to engage in activities, especially if they're concerned about her not being involved. But the line between encouragement and pressure is thin. The parents might not realize that Ellie isn't into any of the options they're presenting, or maybe they need to give her more space to discover her own interests without judgment.\n\nAlso, the daughter is 15, so she's in a phase where autonomy is important. If the parents are pressuring her to choose something and be good at it, she might push back as a way to assert her independence. The parents might need to balance their expectations with respecting her current lack of interest and supporting her when she's ready to explore on her own terms.\n\nI think the parents are in the wrong because they're expecting her to be good at something without considering her current interests and autonomy. They might not be acknowledging that it's okay for her to not have a passion right now. Their approach could be more about their own desires or societal pressures rather than Ellie's needs. They should focus on creating a supportive environment where she feels safe to explore without the pressure of excelling.\n"
