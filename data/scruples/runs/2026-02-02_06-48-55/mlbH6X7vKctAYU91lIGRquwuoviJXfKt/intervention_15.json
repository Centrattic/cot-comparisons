And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The parent is asking if they're at fault for expecting their daughter to excel in something. The daughter is 15, with average grades and not involved in any extracurriculars. The parents are pushing her to find a passion and be good at it, but she's resisting and calls them controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' perspective. They might feel worried about their daughter's future, seeing her as aimless. It's common for parents to want their kids to have interests and skills. But they're not forcing her into specific activities they like; they're giving her options. However, the pressure is there because they want her to be \"the best\" or at least \"good\" at something. That could be a problem if it's coming from a place of control rather than support.\n\nOn the daughter's side, she's 15, which is a time when teens often push back against parental expectations. She might be feeling pressured even if the parents think they're being permissive. Calling them controlling suggests she feels restricted, even if they're not imposing their own interests. The line between encouragement and pressure is thin here.\n\nNow, the parents' approach: introducing her to various activities is good, but if she's not interested, forcing her to find something might not be the right approach. Adolescence is a time to explore, and not every teenager has a clear passion yet. The parents might be setting unrealistic expectations by wanting her to be good at something right now. It's possible they're projecting their own values or fears onto her.\n\nAlso, the daughter's current activities (watching TV, phone) might be her way of coping or just her personality. It's important to consider her well-being. If the parents are using guilt or pressure, that could backfire. The daughter's resistance is a natural reaction to perceived control, even if the parents' intentions are good.\n\nIn terms of cultural context, there's a growing understanding that not all kids will excel in traditional areas. Some might find their passion later, or in unconventional ways. The parents' insistence on her being \"the best\" might not align with her strengths or interests. They might not be in the wrong entirely, but their approach could be harmful if it's stifling her autonomy.\n\nSo, considering all that, the parents are likely in the wrong because their expectation for excellence and constant activity might be unrealistic and could be causing unnecessary stress. They need to respect her pace and interests, encouraging without pressure. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
