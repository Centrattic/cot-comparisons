And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is wrong for expecting their daughter to be good at something. The parent says Ellie is 15, not into anything, and they want her to be good at something. They've tried introducing her to various activities but she resists, calling them controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. They want their daughter to have interests and hobbies, which is common for parents to encourage. But they're pushing for her to be good at something, which might be pressuring her. The daughter is a teenager, so her resistance could be part of seeking independence. The parents say they're letting her choose, but maybe the underlying expectation that she must excel at something is still a form of control. The daughter feels controlled because the parents are imposing a requirement that she participate in something, even if the choice of activity is hers. The parents might not realize that forcing a child to have interests, regardless of the choice, can be stressful. Also, the daughter's current activities (Netflix, phone) might just be her way of relaxing. Maybe the parents are projecting their own desires onto her, wanting her to have achievements. But is it wrong? Well, it's about balancing support with pressure. The parents want the best for their child, but the approach might be too demanding. So the answer is likely A (Yes, the parent is in the wrong) because they're imposing expectations under the guise of freedom of choice.\n"
