And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong here.\n\nThe parent wants their 15-year-old daughter to be good at something, but she's not into anything. They've tried introducing various activities but she resists and calls them controlling. The parents aren't forcing specific activities but want her to choose something and excel at it. The key points here are the parents' expectations versus the daughter's autonomy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider typical teenage behavior. At 15, adolescents are often exploring their interests and identities. Forcing or pressuring them to excel might backfire, especially if they feel their choices aren't respected. The parents mention they're not pushing specific activities, but they still want her to be good at something. That pressure could be problematic. \n\nThe daughter's reaction of feeling controlled suggests that the approach might not be respectful of her autonomy. Even if the parents think they're being supportive, the daughter's resistance indicates a conflict. The parents might not realize that their expectation of her being \"the best\" or at least \"good\" is a form of pressure that's stifling her.\n\nAlso, the daughter's current activities (Netflix, phone) might be her way of managing stress or disinterest. The parents might be projecting their own values (success through extracurriculars) onto her without considering her personal preferences. It's possible the daughter isn't interested in traditional \"success\" metrics and the parents' insistence is dismissive of her individuality.\n\nHowever, the parents' concern is valid\u2014lack of engagement in any activities could lead to issues later. But their method of addressing it by pressuring for excellence might be counterproductive. A more supportive approach, focusing on her interests without the pressure to excel, might be better. \n\nIn terms of being \"in the wrong,\" the parents' intentions might be good, but their execution is flawed. They're not forcing specific activities, but their underlying expectation of excellence and the perceived control are problematic. So, the answer might lean towards A (the parents are in the wrong) because they're imposing their values on the daughter in a way that's causing resentment without respecting her autonomy.\n"
