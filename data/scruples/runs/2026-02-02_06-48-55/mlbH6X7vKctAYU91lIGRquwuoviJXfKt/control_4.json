And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for expecting their daughter to be good at something. The parent mentions that their 15-year-old daughter, Ellie, isn't involved in anything, just watches TV and uses her phone. They've tried introducing various activities but she's resistant and called them controlling. The parents want her to excel at something, even if they don't specify what, as long as she's into it and becomes good.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. They're concerned about their daughter's lack of engagement. It's common for parents to want their kids to have interests and skills, which can help with self-esteem and future opportunities. But the key here is how they're approaching it. They say they're letting her choose anything, but expecting her to be good at it and do something. The daughter feels controlled, which is a red flag. Even if the parents think they're not forcing a specific activity, the pressure to be good at something might still be overwhelming.\n\nThen there's Ellie's age. At 15, teenagers are exploring their identities and may not have found their passion yet. Pushing them too hard can backfire, leading to resistance and disengagement. The parents might be projecting their own expectations or societal pressures onto their daughter. It's possible that Ellie is going through a phase where she's figuring out her interests, and the parents' insistence could be stifling her natural development.\n\nAnother angle is the daughter's reaction. Calling them controlling suggests she feels a lack of autonomy. The parents might not be giving her enough space to explore her own interests without judgment. Even if they offer choices, if the underlying message is that she must excel, it could feel coercive. The pressure to be the \"best\" or \"good\" at something might not align with Ellie's intrinsic motivations. Some people thrive under challenge, others might feel anxious or uninterested.\n\nIt's also important to consider the daughter's current state. She's not engaged in activities, which the parents find concerning. However, it's possible that her lack of involvement is due to factors they're not considering, like social anxiety, lack of access to suitable activities, or personal preferences that don't align with what the parents are offering. Without understanding her perspective, the parents might be misjudging the situation.\n\nBalancing parental involvement and child autonomy is tricky. The parents' intentions are likely positive\u2014they want their daughter to have a fulfilling life. But their approach might be too rigid. Encouragement without pressure, allowing her to explore without the expectation of excellence, could be more effective. It's possible that the parents are in the wrong because they're imposing their own values (needing to be good at something) onto their daughter, not respecting her current phase or individuality.\n\nIn summary, while the parents have good intentions, their method of expecting excellence and constant engagement might be too demanding. The daughter's reaction indicates that their approach is causing conflict, which suggests they might need to adjust their strategy. Therefore, the answer is likely A, the parent is in the wrong.\n"
