And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is about whether they are at fault for expecting their 15-year-old daughter, Ellie, to be good at something. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the parents are concerned because Ellie isn't into anything. She's average in school and spends a lot of time on her phone and Netflix. They want her to be good at something, whether it's sports, art, etc. They've tried introducing her to various activities but she's resistant, calling them controlling. The parents say they're not forcing specific activities but want her to choose something and excel at it.\n\nHmm. So the parents are pushing their daughter to find a passion or strength, but she's not interested. The key points here are the parents' expectations and the daughter's resistance. \n\nOn one hand, parents often want their kids to have interests and skills, which can contribute to their development. It's natural for parents to encourage involvement. But on the other hand, expecting a teenager to be \"the best at something\" might be putting pressure on her. At 15, some kids are still figuring out their interests. The parents might be imposing their own values or fears onto Ellie.\n\nThe daughter's reaction of calling them controlling suggests that the approach might be too forceful. Even if the parents say they're letting her choose, the underlying message might be that any choice is acceptable as long as she's good at it. That could feel overwhelming or like an ultimatum. Also, the parents are not allowing her to be \"aimless,\" which is a natural phase for some teens. They might be invalidating her current state without understanding that she's in a different place.\n\nAnother angle: the parents are concerned about her hobbies being limited to TV and phone, which are passive. They want active participation. But maybe Ellie is introverted or just not interested in the activities they're offering. The parents are trying to expose her to many options, but if she's not finding something that resonates, forcing her might not be the solution. It's possible they're not respecting her autonomy.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the parents have good intentions but their approach might be overbearing. They want her to excel without allowing her the freedom to explore at her own pace. The daughter's feeling that they're controlling indicates that the pressure is there, even if unintentional. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they're imposing expectations without considering their daughter's need for self-directed exploration. The answer would be A, yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
