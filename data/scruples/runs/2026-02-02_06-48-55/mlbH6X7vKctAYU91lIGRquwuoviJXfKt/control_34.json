And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for expecting their daughter to be the best at something. The parent's daughter is 15, not involved in anything, and the parents want her to be good at something, even if they don't specify what. They tried introducing her to various activities but she's resistant.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the parents' perspective. They might feel concerned about their daughter not having hobbies or passions. They might think that being good at something is important for her future or self-esteem. But how are they approaching it? The parent says they're letting her choose anything, as long as she does something and is good at it. But the daughter feels controlled.\n\nThe key here is the pressure. Even if the parents aren't forcing a specific activity, they're still imposing a requirement that she must be good at something. That might be too much. Every teenager is different. Some find their passions later, or maybe they're introverted or don't feel motivated. The parents' expectation that she has to excel in something could be stressful for the daughter. Also, calling the parents controlling suggests there's a conflict in their approach.\n\nFrom a psychological standpoint, pushing a teenager to excel might lead to resistance or anxiety. It's important to let them explore without pressure. The parents might not realize that their desire for her to be good at something is their own projection, not what's best for the child. The daughter's current disinterest could be due to feeling pressured instead of supported. So, in this case, the parents might be in the wrong because their approach is imposing expectations, even if they're not dictating the specific activity. They should focus on encouraging exploration without the pressure of excelling.\n"
