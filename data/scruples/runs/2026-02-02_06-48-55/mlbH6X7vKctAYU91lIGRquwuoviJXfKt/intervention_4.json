And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent who wrote this is in the wrong. The parent is concerned that their 15-year-old daughter isn't into anything and wants her to be good at something. They tried introducing various activities but she's resistant and feels controlled.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. They want their daughter to have interests and skills, which is common. However, the way they're approaching it might be an issue. The parent mentions letting her choose anything as long as she's good at it. But the daughter is calling them controlling. That's a red flag. Even if the parents aren't forcing specific activities, the pressure to excel in something might be too much. \n\nAt 15, teenagers are in a stage of self-discovery. Forcing them to be \"the best\" at something could backfire, leading to resentment or anxiety. The key is whether the parents are being controlling versus supportive. The line between encouraging and pressuring can be thin. If the parents are pushing for their own expectations rather than the child's interests, that's problematic. \n\nAlso, the daughter doesn't have hobbies beyond TV and phone. The parents might be worried about her future, but expecting her to be \"good at something\" isn't realistic without her own intrinsic motivation. The parent's response to \"doing nothing\" as unacceptable might not consider the daughter's personality or interests. \n\nSo, the parents' intention is good, but their approach could be overbearing. They might be in the wrong by not respecting their daughter's autonomy and interests. The right approach would be to support her in finding her own passions without the pressure to excel. Hence, the answer is A.\n"
