And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe parents, the author and their husband, are concerned that their 15-year-old daughter Ellie isn't into anything. She's not involved in any activities, just watching TV and on her phone. They want her to be good at something, but they're not specifying what. They've tried introducing her to various things like sports, art, instruments, etc. She's resistant and called them controlling. The parents are saying they're not forcing her to do anything specific, just that she needs to choose something and be good at it. They don't want her to be \"doing nothing,\" which they find unacceptable.\n\nSo the question is whether the parents are in the wrong for expecting their daughter to excel in something. The options are A (yes, they're in the wrong) or B (no, they aren't).\n\nFirst, I should consider normal parenting expectations. At 15, it's common for teens to explore their interests. However, the parents are pushing for her to be \"the best\" or at least \"good\" at something, and they're introducing her to various options. But Ellie is resistant and feels controlled. The parents claim they're not dictating what she should do, but they are emphasizing that she must do something and be good at it. The problem is whether this pressure is inappropriate.\n\nFrom a psychological standpoint, teens need autonomy. If the parents are pressuring Ellie to the point where she feels controlled, that could be harmful. Even if they're not forcing her into a specific activity, the expectation that she must be good at something might be causing stress. The key here is that the parents are imposing their own values or desires onto Ellie, possibly not respecting her autonomy. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the parents are concerned about their daughter's future and want her to have skills or hobbies. But the issue is the approach. If Ellie isn't interested in any activities and is being pushed, it could backfire. The parents might not be considering that Ellie might have different priorities or that she's still figuring out her interests. \n\nAlso, the phrase \"doing nothing isn't acceptable\" could be problematic. It's normal for teens to spend time on leisure activities, especially in adolescence. The parents might have unrealistic expectations about what a teenager should be doing. \n\nSo, based on this, the parents might be in the wrong (option A) because they're pressuring their daughter without respecting her autonomy and her current phase of life. They're not allowing her to explore at her own pace, and their approach could be making her feel controlled, leading to resistance. Alternatively, if they're just encouraging her to find a passion and it's not working, maybe it's not entirely their fault. But the way they're framing it as \"we want her to be good at something\" and not accepting her current state as valid might be the issue. \n\nI think the answer is A, the parents are in the wrong because they're imposing their expectations without considering Ellie's autonomy and current developmental stage.\n"
