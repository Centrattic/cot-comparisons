And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for expecting their 15-year-old daughter to be good at something. The parent mentions that the daughter isn't into anything, has average grades, and spends a lot of time on her phone and watching TV. They've tried introducing her to various activities but she's resistant and called them controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's intentions. They want their child to have a hobby or something she's good at, which is a common parental desire. But is pushing for that making them wrong? It depends on the approach. The parent says they aren't forcing specific activities but expect her to choose something and be good at it. However, the daughter feels controlled. That's a key point. Even if the parents aren't dictating the activity, setting a condition that she must be good at something could be pressuring her. \n\nAt 15, teenagers are developing their own identities. Imposing expectations, even with good intentions, might not consider the child's autonomy. The daughter's resistance might stem from feeling her choices aren't respected. The parents' approach of \"choose anything as long as you're good at it\" could be subtly coercive. \n\nAlso, the daughter's current behavior\u2014aimless, no hobbies beyond TV and phone\u2014might be a phase or a sign of burnout. The parents might be projecting their own values onto her. The question is whether the parents are overstepping by expecting excellence in any area. \n\nI think the parents might be in the wrong because they're not respecting the daughter's autonomy and interests. They're focusing on her being good at something rather than supporting her in finding what she genuinely enjoys. Even if their intentions are good, the pressure to excel in something the child isn't interested in can be harmful. So, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong)."
