And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a parent who's upset that their 15-year-old daughter, Ellie, isn't into anything\u2014her grades are average, and she spends a lot of time on her phone and watching Netflix. The parents want her to be good at something, whether it's sports, art, etc., and they've tried introducing her to various activities. Ellie called them controlling, but the parents say they're just letting her choose as long as she does something. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but they want my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the parents' approach. The key points are that the parents are pushing Ellie to be good at something, but Ellie isn't interested in any of the activities they've introduced. The parents are allowing her to choose, but they're insistent that she must be good at *something*. The daughter feels pressured and calls them controlling. The parents argue they aren't forcing her to do any specific activity.\n\nFrom a parenting perspective, it's important to consider the child's autonomy and interests. Adolescence is a time when teens develop their own identities. If the parents are pushing for her to excel in any area without considering her interests, that could be seen as overbearing. The fact that Ellie is 15 means she's at an age where she's forming her own preferences. The parents might be imposing their expectations, which could lead to resentment.\n\nHowever, the parents might have valid concerns about their daughter being inactive and disengaged. It's common for parents to want their children to be involved in some activities, as it can build skills and a sense of accomplishment. But the way they're approaching it\u2014introducing her to various activities but not respecting her disinterest\u2014might be the issue here.\n\nThe daughter calling them controlling suggests that she feels pressured. The parents say they're not forcing her to do specific things, but their insistence that she must be good at *something* regardless of her interests could be the controlling part. It's possible that the parents are projecting their own values or fears onto their child, not recognizing that being \"good at something\" isn't a universal necessity for happiness or success.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents could be genuinely concerned about their daughter's future and want to encourage her to explore her potential. But their method might be flawed. Instead of pushing her to excel in anything, they might need to have a conversation with Ellie to understand her perspective and find activities that align with her interests, even if they're unconventional.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the parents might be in the wrong if their approach is causing stress and conflict without considering their daughter's autonomy. However, if their intention is to guide her towards a more engaged lifestyle, there's some nuance. The line between encouragement and control is thin here. The fact that Ellie is disengaged might stem from other factors (like social pressures, mental health) that the parents aren't addressing. The parents' insistence on her being \"good at something\" without considering her interests could be the issue.\n\nSo, based on this, I think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because they're imposing their expectations without respecting their daughter's autonomy and interests. The pressure to excel in any area without considering her preferences is problematic.\n"
