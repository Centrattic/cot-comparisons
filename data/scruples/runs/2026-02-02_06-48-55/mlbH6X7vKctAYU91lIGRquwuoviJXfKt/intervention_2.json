And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for expecting their 15-year-old daughter to be good at something. The parent mentions that the daughter isn't into anything, not involved in activities, and they want her to be good at something. They've tried introducing various activities but the daughter feels controlled.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. They want their child to have direction, maybe fearing she's not prepared for the future. They might think that having a skill or hobby is important for personal development and success. But is pushing for that causing issues?\n\nOn the other hand, the daughter is a teenager, which is a time when autonomy and self-identity are crucial. Feeling pressured to be \"good at something\" might be stressful, especially if she's not interested. The parent says they allow her to choose, but the daughter perceives it as controlling. Maybe the parent isn't allowing her to just explore without the pressure of being good. \n\nAlso, the daughter's current activities (Netflix and phone) aren't necessarily negative, but the parents see them as a problem. It's possible the parents are projecting their own expectations or societal pressures onto their child. Every child is different; some might not find their passion until later, or maybe Ellie is just content without structured activities.\n\nBut is expecting her to engage in something inherently wrong? The parent isn't forcing a specific activity, just encouraging participation. However, the emphasis on being \"the best\" or \"good\" might be the issue. It's possible the parent is more focused on the outcome (being good) rather than the process (her enjoying and exploring interests). \n\nThe daughter feeling controlled suggests that the approach isn't working. Maybe the parents need to step back and support her in finding her own path without the pressure of excellence. So, in that case, the parent might be in the wrong because they're imposing expectations that don't align with the daughter's interests and could be causing stress. The key might be respecting her autonomy versus the desire for her to have direction.\n"
