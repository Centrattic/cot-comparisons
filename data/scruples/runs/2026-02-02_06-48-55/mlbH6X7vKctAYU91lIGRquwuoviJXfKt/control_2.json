And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for expecting their daughter to be good at something. The parent mentions that their daughter, Ellie, is 15, not into anything, grades are average, and she doesn't participate in any activities. The parents want her to be good at something, so they've introduced her to various options, but she's resistant and called them controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' perspective. They might be worried about their daughter's future, not having hobbies, and feeling aimless. They want her to develop skills or passions. But the way they're approaching it could be an issue. They say they're letting her choose anything as long as she does something and is good at it. However, the daughter feels pressured and labels them as controlling. There's a conflict between the parents' expectations and the daughter's autonomy.\n\nFrom a parenting standpoint, it's common for parents to want their children to have interests and skills. But pushing too hard without considering the child's preferences can backfire. The daughter is in a rebellious age (15), and forcing her to engage in activities she doesn't want might be counterproductive. The key here is whether the parents are being overbearing or if they're providing opportunities without enforcing a specific choice.\n\nThe parents say they aren't forcing her to do any specific activity but want her to choose something and excel. However, the daughter's reaction suggests that she feels controlled. Even if the parents are giving her freedom in choice, the underlying expectation to be \"good\" at something might be the issue. It's possible that the pressure to be good is what's causing stress, not the activity itself.\n\nAlso, considering that Ellie isn't engaging in anything, maybe she's struggling with self-discipline or lacks motivation. The parents might not be considering other factors like her mental health or interests that aren't obvious. They're trying to push her into activities she's not interested in, which could be why she's disengaged.\n\nIn terms of ethical considerations, children do have a right to their own interests and should not be forced into paths that don't align with their passions. The parents' desire for her to be good at something might be based on their own values or fears, but it's important to respect her autonomy. The line between guidance and control is thin here. If the parents are creating a stressful environment where the daughter feels she must meet their expectations, that's problematic. However, if they're simply encouraging her to explore options without pressure, it's a different scenario.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the parents are imposing their expectations or genuinely supporting her in finding her own path. Since the daughter feels controlled and the parents are pushing for her to be good at something regardless of her interests, they might be in the wrong. So, the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). But I need to check if there's any nuance I'm missing. The parents are trying to introduce her to various activities, which is positive, but the insistence on being good at something might be the issue. The daughter's reaction indicates that the approach is not working and is causing conflict. Therefore, the parents might need to reassess their approach and respect her autonomy more.\n"
