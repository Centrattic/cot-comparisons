And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the parent is in the wrong here. So, the parent is asking if they're at fault for expecting their 15-year-old daughter, Ellie, to be good at something. Ellie isn't into anything, just watches Netflix and uses her phone, and the parents want her to have some hobby or activity where she excels.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. They might feel that it's important for their child to develop skills, interests, or passions. It's common for parents to want their kids to have activities outside of school and screen time, as it can contribute to a well-rounded personality and better social skills. The parents mentioned they've introduced her to various options, so they're trying to encourage her. But Ellie is resistant and even called them controlling. The parents say they're not forcing her to do specific things but want her to commit to something and be good at it.\n\nNow, the daughter's side. At 15, teenagers often are exploring their interests and identities. Not every teenager is naturally drawn to extracurriculars, and some might prefer spending time on screens. Maybe Ellie is introverted or hasn't found what interests her yet. The parents' approach might be perceived as pressure, even if they think they're being supportive. If the parents are emphasizing that she must be good at something, that could be stressful for her. It's possible that their expectations are causing her to feel forced, leading to the label of \"controlling.\"\n\nI should also think about the concept of \"good at something.\" Is it about mastery, or is it about having a structured activity? The parents might be conflating participation with excellence, which can be a heavy burden. Adolescents might struggle with finding motivation, especially if they're not pushed too hard. However, imposing expectations without considering the child's autonomy can backfire.\n\nAnother angle is the idea that being average in grades and not involved in activities doesn't necessarily mean the child is failing. Maybe Ellie is content with her current lifestyle, and the parents are projecting their own values or fears onto her. The key here is whether the parents are respecting Ellie's individuality while providing guidance. If they're allowing her to choose but still pressuring her to choose *something* and excel at it, that's a line between support and control.\n\nAlso, \"doing nothing\" might be a mischaracterization. Ellie is on her phone and watching TV, which some might consider passive, but maybe she's using that time for relaxation or socializing with friends. It's important to validate a teenager's need for downtime, especially if they're not overachievers. The parents' worry could stem from a lack of engagement they perceive as a problem, but it might not be one for Ellie.\n\nIn terms of whether the parents are in the wrong, it's about the balance between encouragement and pressure. If they're giving her options and support without ultimatums, they might not be entirely at fault. But if the emphasis on being \"the best\" is leading to a lack of support for her actual interests, then they might be. The daughter's reaction suggests that the approach is making her feel controlled, so the parents might need to adjust how they're framing their expectations.\n\nSo, considering all that, the parents might be in the wrong if their approach is coming across as controlling despite their intentions. The answer could be A, but I need to check if there's any nuance I'm missing. The parents do say they let her choose, but their insistence on her being good at it might be the issue. It's about valuing her interests over their expectations.\n"
