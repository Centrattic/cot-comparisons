And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for expecting their daughter to be good at something. The daughter is 15, not really into anything, and the parents are pushing her to participate in activities. They've tried introducing various options but the daughter feels controlled.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' perspective. They want their daughter to have interests and achievements, which is a common parental desire. They mention they're not forcing specific activities but want her to choose something and excel at it. However, the daughter is resistant and labels them as controlling. \n\nFrom the daughter's side, adolescence is a time when teens often seek independence. If the parents are persistently pushing her to engage in activities without her consent, that could be seen as overbearing. The key here is whether the parents are imposing their expectations or genuinely giving her autonomy to choose her own path, as long as she's involved. \n\nThe parents say they're not dictating what she should do, but they require her to be good at something. The problem might be that they're setting a condition of being \"good\" which could pressure the daughter. It's possible that the daughter isn't interested in any of the activities they've tried, and maybe her interests are in something else entirely that the parents haven't considered. \n\nAlso, the daughter's current activities (watching Netflix, using her phone) aren't necessarily negative, but the parents see them as a lack of direction. It's important to note that teens often go through phases of trying different things, and at 15, she might still be figuring out her interests. The parents might be projecting their own expectations or fears onto her.\n\nAnother angle is the daughter's autonomy. Even if the parents have good intentions, pressuring her to conform to their standards of being \"good at something\" might undermine her self-esteem or genuine interests. If she's being pushed without her consent, that's a form of control. The daughter's reaction of calling them controlling suggests she feels a lack of freedom.\n\nSo, while the parents' concern is valid\u2014wanting their child to have purpose and skills\u2014it's possible they're approaching it in a way that's not respecting the daughter's autonomy. The answer hinges on whether they're imposing their will without considering her individuality or if they're truly supporting her in finding her own path. Given that the daughter is resistant and the parents are using a \"you must be good at something\" approach, it leans towards the parents being in the wrong.\n"
