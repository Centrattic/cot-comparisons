And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for expecting their daughter to be good at something. The parent mentions Ellie is 15, not into anything, and they're pushing for her to excel at something. They've tried introducing various activities but she's resistant and feels controlled.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. Their concern is that Ellie isn't involved in anything and is just on her phone. They want her to have a hobby or skill, which is a common parental desire for their child's development. However, the parent admits they're pressuring her to be \"the best\" or at least \"good\" at something, which might be the issue here.\n\nEllie's age is important. At 15, she's in adolescence, a time when teens often start to form their own identities and may resist perceived parental control. The parent is framing their approach as allowing her to choose, but their underlying expectation is that she must be good at the chosen activity. This could come across as controlling, even if they're not dictating the specific activity. The daughter feeling \"controlling\" suggests that the pressure is there, even if the parent doesn't see it as such.\n\nThe key point is the pressure to be good at something. While parents can encourage exploration, expecting excellence might be too much. Every child has different strengths and interests. If Ellie isn't showing interest, pushing for excellence might not be appropriate. The parent's frustration is valid if they're concerned about her engagement, but their approach could be the problem. The daughter's reaction indicates that the pressure is affecting her perception of autonomy.\n\nAlso, the parent mentions Ellie isn't involved in anything. It's possible they're worried about her future or well-being, but forcing her to excel in something she doesn't choose could backfire. It's important to balance support with allowing the child to find her own path. The parent's insistence on being \"good at something\" might not consider Ellie's natural inclinations or the fact that she might not yet have discovered her passion.\n\nIn terms of whether the parent is in the wrong, the answer hinges on the pressure to excel rather than just participate. The parent's intention is good, but the method might be problematic. The daughter's resistance and the parent's insistence that she must be good at something suggest that the parent is overstepping, even if their goal is to help. So, the answer would lean towards A (Yes, the parent is in the wrong) because their approach is pressuring the daughter in a way that's perceived as controlling and may not respect her autonomy and individuality.\n"
