And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a 15-year-old daughter named Ellie who isn't into anything. Her parents are pushing her to be good at something, but she's not interested and they're trying various activities. They even mention that Ellie called them controlling, but they think they're not being controlling, just wanting her to choose something and excel.\n\nFirst, I need to consider typical parenting dynamics. At 15, teenagers often have their own interests and may resist pressure from parents. The parents here are trying to encourage their daughter to engage in activities beyond just watching TV and using her phone. However, their approach might be problematic.\n\nThe key points here are that the parents are introducing her to various activities (\"a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc.\") but she's not interested. They want her to be good at something, and they're letting her choose as long as she does something. However, the daughter feels pressured and calls them controlling. The parents might be misinterpreting their own behavior as not controlling, but their insistence on her being good at something could be seen as pressuring her to conform to their expectations rather than respecting her autonomy.\n\nIn many cases, especially with teenagers, pushing too hard can lead to resistance and resentment. The parents might be projecting their own desires onto their daughter, expecting her to find an activity they consider valuable. However, every child is different. If Ellie is content with her current interests (even if they're just relaxing), maybe the parents are not considering that her interests might develop later or in a different area they're not considering.\n\nAlso, the parents mention that her grades are average and she's not involved in anything. They want her to excel in some area. But forcing a child to be good at something without their interest can lead to burnout or a negative association with activities. It's important for a teenager to explore and find what they truly enjoy, even if it's not something traditional.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents are concerned about her being \"aimless,\" which is a common parental concern. They might genuinely want her to have hobbies and interests. However, the way they're approaching it\u2014introducing her to multiple activities and expecting her to excel\u2014could be overwhelming. It's possible they're not giving her the space to find her own path without judgment.\n\nAnother angle: the parents are allowing her to choose, but the underlying message is that she must choose something and be good at it. The daughter might feel that even with the \"freedom\" to choose, the pressure is still there to meet certain standards. The line between encouragement and control can be thin here.\n\nIn conclusion, while the parents' intentions are understandable, their approach might be infringing on Ellie's autonomy. The daughter's reaction suggests that she feels controlled, which indicates that the parents' methods could be problematic. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they're imposing expectations on their daughter without respecting her current interests and autonomy.\n"
