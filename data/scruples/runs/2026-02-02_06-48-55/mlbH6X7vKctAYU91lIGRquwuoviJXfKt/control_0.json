And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. \n\nWe've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.\n\nAita?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting their daughter to be good at something. The daughter is 15, not involved in any activities, spends time on Netflix and her phone. The parents want her to be into something, tried introducing various things but she's resistant, even calling them controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' intentions. They mention they're not forcing specific activities but want her to choose something and be good at it. They see inactivity as a problem. But is pushing a child to excel in something their choice might not be appropriate? The daughter is a teenager, which is a time of self-discovery. Forcing or even expecting her to be good at something could add pressure.\n\nThe parents might be projecting their own values or fears onto the daughter. Maybe they worry about her future success being tied to having a skill. But every child is different. Some may find their passion later, others might not excel in traditional areas. The key here is whether the parents are respecting her autonomy versus imposing their expectations.\n\nAlso, the daughter's reaction of calling them controlling suggests there's tension. Even if the parents think they're being supportive, the child might feel pressured. The line between encouragement and control can be thin. The parents might not realize that their insistence on her being \"good\" at something is creating stress.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents might be concerned about her lack of direction. But expecting her to excel could be counterproductive. It's possible that the daughter isn't interested in any of the activities they've tried, so maybe they need to find something she's actually passionate about, not just any activity.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, pushing a teenager to be the best in something they don't care about can be harmful. It's important to support the child's interests rather than imposing the parents' desires. So, the answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong (A) because they're expecting excellence without considering the daughter's actual interests and autonomy.\n"
