It was hell and as a result I don\u2019t drink at all and don\u2019t like being around drunk people.  \n\nWhen I started dating my girlfriend I knew that she drank and discussed my issues with it.  I just asked her that she doesn\u2019t drink around me.  It worked out fine, she was great about not even drunk dialing me, a problem I had with my ex girlfriend.  \n\nWhen we started discussing moving in I was very apprehensive about it.  I asked her if she could really handle not drinking at all in our home and she was adamant that it was no big deal.  That if she wanted to drink she could just spend that night at a friends and that she really didn\u2019t drink that often anyways so it wouldn\u2019t be a problem.  \n\nThe first few months that\u2019s exactly what happened.  Since then though there have been times that she\u2019s come home obviously drunk and just lying about it to me.  I\u2019ve talked her about it to mixed reactions.  Sometimes she will apologize profusely and promise not to let it happen again.   Other times it becomes an argument about how I\u2019m projecting my mother\u2019s problem on our situation.  That she\u2019s not an alcoholic or abusive.  Which is true, but it\u2019s not really about her being abusive, it\u2019s that being around drunk people drudges up a lot of painful memories for me.  She just brushed that off though.  \n\nAfter this last time it happened she\u2019s outright fighting me on the issue.   She says this is her home too and we\u2019re both adults.   That I need to get therapy instead of trying to control her.  We had a clear agreement before we moved in though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for asking their girlfriend not to drink in their home. The situation involves the author's past with an abusive alcoholic mother, which makes them uncomfortable around alcohol. They discussed this with their girlfriend before moving in and had an agreement. Now, the girlfriend is coming home drunk and lying about it, leading to arguments.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They have a valid reason for not wanting to be around alcohol due to their traumatic experiences. Setting boundaries in a relationship, especially after discussing them, is reasonable. The girlfriend agreed initially but is now not honoring that agreement. That's a problem because boundaries should be respected once agreed upon.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend argues that it's her home too and she's an adult. But the agreement was mutual before moving in. The fact that she's lying and coming home drunk suggests she's breaking the terms they both set. The author isn't necessarily controlling; they're holding up their end of the agreement. The girlfriend's reaction of saying the author needs therapy instead of addressing the issue might indicate defensiveness or unwillingness to compromise.\n\nThe key points are: the author's past trauma, prior discussion and agreement, the girlfriend's current actions violating that agreement, and the girlfriend dismissing the author's feelings. The author's stance is about their personal comfort and triggers, which should be respected. The girlfriend's behavior is the main issue here. The user initially thought the author was in the wrong but wants to know if that's the case. Based on the information, the author seems to be in the right for setting and maintaining boundaries, so the answer should be B.\n"
