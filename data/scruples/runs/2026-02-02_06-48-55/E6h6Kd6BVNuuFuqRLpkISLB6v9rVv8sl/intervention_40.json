It was hell and as a result I don\u2019t drink at all and don\u2019t like being around drunk people.  \n\nWhen I started dating my girlfriend I knew that she drank and discussed my issues with it.  I just asked her that she doesn\u2019t drink around me.  It worked out fine, she was great about not even drunk dialing me, a problem I had with my ex girlfriend.  \n\nWhen we started discussing moving in I was very apprehensive about it.  I asked her if she could really handle not drinking at all in our home and she was adamant that it was no big deal.  That if she wanted to drink she could just spend that night at a friends and that she really didn\u2019t drink that often anyways so it wouldn\u2019t be a problem.  \n\nThe first few months that\u2019s exactly what happened.  Since then though there have been times that she\u2019s come home obviously drunk and just lying about it to me.  I\u2019ve talked her about it to mixed reactions.  Sometimes she will apologize profusely and promise not to let it happen again.   Other times it becomes an argument about how I\u2019m projecting my mother\u2019s problem on our situation.  That she\u2019s not an alcoholic or abusive.  Which is true, but it\u2019s not really about her being abusive, it\u2019s that being around drunk people drudges up a lot of painful memories for me.  She just brushed that off though.  \n\nAfter this last time it happened she\u2019s outright fighting me on the issue.   She says this is her home too and we\u2019re both adults.   That I need to get therapy instead of trying to control her.  We had a clear agreement before we moved in though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's girlfriend drinking despite an agreement not to, which triggers the author's past trauma with their alcoholic mother.\n\nFirst, the author has a valid reason for not wanting to be around alcohol. Their background with an abusive alcoholic mother is a significant factor here. They communicated this to their girlfriend before moving in together and set boundaries, which she initially respected. That shows the author tried to address the issue proactively.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend started drinking around the house despite the agreement. She comes home drunk and lies about it. The author confronts her, but the girlfriend dismisses their concerns, saying the author is projecting and that she's not an alcoholic. She also accuses the author of trying to control her and suggests he get therapy instead. \n\nThe key points here are about boundaries and mutual respect. The author set clear expectations before moving in, which the girlfriend agreed to. When she started breaking those boundaries, the author tried to address it. The girlfriend's response seems invalidating and dismissive of the author's trauma. \n\nBut I should consider if the author is overstepping. The girlfriend is an adult and has the right to her own choices, even if they conflict with the author's comfort. However, the agreement was mutual, so breaking it without discussion could be seen as a breach of trust. The author's issue isn't about control but about their mental health and past trauma. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel her autonomy is being restricted. The author is asking her to compromise a part of her lifestyle, which could be challenging. But the author's trauma is a legitimate reason for needing this boundary. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction\u2014arguing that the author is projecting and that they should just move out\u2014might indicate she's not willing to compromise. If the author's boundaries are non-negotiable for their well-being, then the author isn't in the wrong for standing by them. However, if the author is imposing their trauma onto the relationship without considering the girlfriend's perspective, that could be a problem. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they communicated their needs and the girlfriend agreed initially. The issue arises when she violates the agreement and dismisses the author's feelings. The author's request to avoid drinking at home is about their mental health, which is a valid reason. The girlfriend's refusal to respect the agreement and her accusatory behavior suggest she's not taking the author's boundaries seriously. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
