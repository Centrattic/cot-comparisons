It was hell and as a result I don\u2019t drink at all and don\u2019t like being around drunk people.  \n\nWhen I started dating my girlfriend I knew that she drank and discussed my issues with it.  I just asked her that she doesn\u2019t drink around me.  It worked out fine, she was great about not even drunk dialing me, a problem I had with my ex girlfriend.  \n\nWhen we started discussing moving in I was very apprehensive about it.  I asked her if she could really handle not drinking at all in our home and she was adamant that it was no big deal.  That if she wanted to drink she could just spend that night at a friends and that she really didn\u2019t drink that often anyways so it wouldn\u2019t be a problem.  \n\nThe first few months that\u2019s exactly what happened.  Since then though there have been times that she\u2019s come home obviously drunk and just lying about it to me.  I\u2019ve talked her about it to mixed reactions.  Sometimes she will apologize profusely and promise not to let it happen again.   Other times it becomes an argument about how I\u2019m projecting my mother\u2019s problem on our situation.  That she\u2019s not an alcoholic or abusive.  Which is true, but it\u2019s not really about her being abusive, it\u2019s that being around drunk people drudges up a lot of painful memories for me.  She just brushed that off though.  \n\nAfter this last time it happened she\u2019s outright fighting me on the issue.   She says this is her home too and we\u2019re both adults.   That I need to get therapy instead of trying to control her.  We had a clear agreement before we moved in though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a relationship where the author has a history with an abusive alcoholic mother and doesn't drink or want to be around drunk people. They asked their girlfriend not to drink around them, and there was an agreement before moving in. However, the girlfriend now comes home drunk and lies about it, leading to arguments.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks they are, but wants my opinion. Let me break it down. \n\nFirst, the author's background. They had a traumatic experience with their mother's alcoholism, which affects their current comfort. That's a valid reason to set boundaries. They communicated this to their girlfriend upfront, and she agreed before moving in. So they had a mutual agreement. \n\nNow, the girlfriend is breaking that agreement. She's coming home drunk and lying. The author confronts her, but she dismisses their feelings, saying it's about projecting their mother's issues. The author's issue isn't that she's an alcoholic or abusive, but the presence of drunkenness triggers them. The girlfriend is now resisting, saying it's her home too, and the author should get therapy instead of controlling her.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they had a clear agreement that was respected initially but now it's being broken. The girlfriend's actions are violating that agreement, which the author is justified in feeling upset about. The girlfriend is not respecting the boundaries that were set, even though the author's reasons are valid and based on trauma. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that the author is overstepping, especially if she doesn't have a drinking problem. She might see it as the author trying to control her. However, the key point is that they had an agreement. If she agreed to not drink at home, and now she's not honoring that, then the author is right to hold her to that. \n\nThe author isn't asking her to stop drinking entirely, just not in their home. The girlfriend's solution of going to a friend's house is what she agreed to. Now she's breaking that, which is a breach of trust. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries and expecting the agreement to be honored. The girlfriend's actions are the issue here. The author's response is reasonable, even if the girlfriend is frustrated. It's about respecting mutual agreements and the author's trauma. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
