It was hell and as a result I don\u2019t drink at all and don\u2019t like being around drunk people.  \n\nWhen I started dating my girlfriend I knew that she drank and discussed my issues with it.  I just asked her that she doesn\u2019t drink around me.  It worked out fine, she was great about not even drunk dialing me, a problem I had with my ex girlfriend.  \n\nWhen we started discussing moving in I was very apprehensive about it.  I asked her if she could really handle not drinking at all in our home and she was adamant that it was no big deal.  That if she wanted to drink she could just spend that night at a friends and that she really didn\u2019t drink that often anyways so it wouldn\u2019t be a problem.  \n\nThe first few months that\u2019s exactly what happened.  Since then though there have been times that she\u2019s come home obviously drunk and just lying about it to me.  I\u2019ve talked her about it to mixed reactions.  Sometimes she will apologize profusely and promise not to let it happen again.   Other times it becomes an argument about how I\u2019m projecting my mother\u2019s problem on our situation.  That she\u2019s not an alcoholic or abusive.  Which is true, but it\u2019s not really about her being abusive, it\u2019s that being around drunk people drudges up a lot of painful memories for me.  She just brushed that off though.  \n\nAfter this last time it happened she\u2019s outright fighting me on the issue.   She says this is her home too and we\u2019re both adults.   That I need to get therapy instead of trying to control her.  We had a clear agreement before we moved in though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's girlfriend drinking despite an agreement not to, leading to conflicts.\n\nFirst, the author has a history with an abusive alcoholic mother, which makes them uncomfortable around alcohol. When they started dating, they communicated their discomfort and set boundaries. The girlfriend initially respected those boundaries by not drinking around the author. However, after moving in together, the girlfriend started coming home drunk and lying about it. The author tried to address it, but the girlfriend argues that the author is projecting their mother's issues and that it's her home too. She even suggests the author needs therapy instead of controlling her.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong but wants to know the opinion. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nLet me break down the key points. The author has valid trauma from their past, leading to a legitimate emotional need to avoid alcohol. They communicated their boundaries upfront and the girlfriend agreed. However, the girlfriend is now violating those agreed-upon boundaries. The author is trying to maintain a safe environment for themselves, which is reasonable. The girlfriend's response is dismissive and even hostile, accusing the author of controlling behavior and suggesting therapy, which could be a deflection.\n\nIn healthy relationships, both partners should respect each other's boundaries. The girlfriend breaking the agreement they had before moving in together is a breach of trust. The author isn't trying to control her in an unhealthy way; they're setting limits based on their trauma. The girlfriend's reaction seems to be invalidating the author's feelings and not taking their boundaries seriously. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have approached the situation differently, like seeking couples' counseling if communication isn't working. But the core issue is about respecting mutual agreements. The author isn't in the wrong for upholding their boundaries, especially when they were clearly discussed and agreed upon beforehand. The girlfriend is the one not honoring the agreement. So, the answer would be B: the author is not in the wrong.\n"
