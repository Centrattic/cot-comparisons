It was hell and as a result I don\u2019t drink at all and don\u2019t like being around drunk people.  \n\nWhen I started dating my girlfriend I knew that she drank and discussed my issues with it.  I just asked her that she doesn\u2019t drink around me.  It worked out fine, she was great about not even drunk dialing me, a problem I had with my ex girlfriend.  \n\nWhen we started discussing moving in I was very apprehensive about it.  I asked her if she could really handle not drinking at all in our home and she was adamant that it was no big deal.  That if she wanted to drink she could just spend that night at a friends and that she really didn\u2019t drink that often anyways so it wouldn\u2019t be a problem.  \n\nThe first few months that\u2019s exactly what happened.  Since then though there have been times that she\u2019s come home obviously drunk and just lying about it to me.  I\u2019ve talked her about it to mixed reactions.  Sometimes she will apologize profusely and promise not to let it happen again.   Other times it becomes an argument about how I\u2019m projecting my mother\u2019s problem on our situation.  That she\u2019s not an alcoholic or abusive.  Which is true, but it\u2019s not really about her being abusive, it\u2019s that being around drunk people drudges up a lot of painful memories for me.  She just brushed that off though.  \n\nAfter this last time it happened she\u2019s outright fighting me on the issue.   She says this is her home too and we\u2019re both adults.   That I need to get therapy instead of trying to control her.  We had a clear agreement before we moved in though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author has a history of an abusive alcoholic mother, which explains their aversion to drinking and being around drunk people. They've been upfront with their girlfriend about this from the start. When they started dating, they discussed the issue, and the girlfriend agreed not to drink around them. That worked well for a while, with her even not drunk-dialing, unlike the author's ex. \n\nThen, when they discussed moving in together, the author asked the girlfriend if she could handle not drinking at home. She said it wasn't a big deal, that she could stay at a friend's if needed, and that she doesn't drink often. Initially, that's what happened. But recently, she's come home drunk and lied about it. The author has talked to her about it, but her reactions are mixed\u2014sometimes she apologizes, other times she argues that the author is projecting their mother's issues onto her, saying she's not an alcoholic or abusive. The girlfriend now says it's her home too, that the author should get therapy instead of controlling her, even though they had an agreement beforehand.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my take. \n\nFirst, the author's request seems reasonable given their trauma. They communicated their boundaries upfront, and the girlfriend agreed to them. The girlfriend is now breaking that agreement, which the author has a valid reason for. The girlfriend's response is dismissive and invalidating, even though she's not an alcoholic, but the author's issue isn't about her being one, but about being around drunk people. The girlfriend is violating the mutual agreement they had, and the author is trying to address it, not control her. The girlfriend's argument that it's her home too might be a bit of a stretch since they had a pre-move-in agreement. The author isn't trying to control, just to maintain their own emotional well-being based on past trauma. The girlfriend's response seems to be defensive and not respecting the original agreement. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
