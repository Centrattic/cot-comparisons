It was hell and as a result I don\u2019t drink at all and don\u2019t like being around drunk people.  \n\nWhen I started dating my girlfriend I knew that she drank and discussed my issues with it.  I just asked her that she doesn\u2019t drink around me.  It worked out fine, she was great about not even drunk dialing me, a problem I had with my ex girlfriend.  \n\nWhen we started discussing moving in I was very apprehensive about it.  I asked her if she could really handle not drinking at all in our home and she was adamant that it was no big deal.  That if she wanted to drink she could just spend that night at a friends and that she really didn\u2019t drink that often anyways so it wouldn\u2019t be a problem.  \n\nThe first few months that\u2019s exactly what happened.  Since then though there have been times that she\u2019s come home obviously drunk and just lying about it to me.  I\u2019ve talked her about it to mixed reactions.  Sometimes she will apologize profusely and promise not to let it happen again.   Other times it becomes an argument about how I\u2019m projecting my mother\u2019s problem on our situation.  That she\u2019s not an alcoholic or abusive.  Which is true, but it\u2019s not really about her being abusive, it\u2019s that being around drunk people drudges up a lot of painful memories for me.  She just brushed that off though.  \n\nAfter this last time it happened she\u2019s outright fighting me on the issue.   She says this is her home too and we\u2019re both adults.   That I need to get therapy instead of trying to control her.  We had a clear agreement before we moved in though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not drinking due to their abusive alcoholic mother and asking their girlfriend not to drink around them. They had an agreement before moving in, but now the girlfriend is coming home drunk and lying about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has a valid reason for their discomfort\u2014trauma from an abusive parent. They communicated their boundaries clearly, and the girlfriend agreed before moving in. However, the girlfriend is now breaking that agreement, lying, and dismissing the author's feelings. \n\nThe author isn't controlling; they're managing their own trauma. The girlfriend, on the other hand, is breaking the agreement and not respecting the author's needs. The arguments from the girlfriend seem dismissive, comparing the author's issues to her not being abusive. That's invalid because the author's issue isn't about abuse but about being around drunk people triggering past trauma.\n\nThe user initially thought the author was in the wrong but wants to know if that's accurate. From the scenario, the author tried to set boundaries, which the girlfriend is not honoring. The girlfriend's behavior is the problem here. The author isn't controlling her; they're asking for respect of their trauma. So the answer should be B (Not in the wrong). The author is justified in wanting their boundaries respected, especially after prior agreement. The girlfriend's actions are the issue, not the author's request.\n"
