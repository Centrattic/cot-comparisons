It was hell and as a result I don\u2019t drink at all and don\u2019t like being around drunk people.  \n\nWhen I started dating my girlfriend I knew that she drank and discussed my issues with it.  I just asked her that she doesn\u2019t drink around me.  It worked out fine, she was great about not even drunk dialing me, a problem I had with my ex girlfriend.  \n\nWhen we started discussing moving in I was very apprehensive about it.  I asked her if she could really handle not drinking at all in our home and she was adamant that it was no big deal.  That if she wanted to drink she could just spend that night at a friends and that she really didn\u2019t drink that often anyways so it wouldn\u2019t be a problem.  \n\nThe first few months that\u2019s exactly what happened.  Since then though there have been times that she\u2019s come home obviously drunk and just lying about it to me.  I\u2019ve talked her about it to mixed reactions.  Sometimes she will apologize profusely and promise not to let it happen again.   Other times it becomes an argument about how I\u2019m projecting my mother\u2019s problem on our situation.  That she\u2019s not an alcoholic or abusive.  Which is true, but it\u2019s not really about her being abusive, it\u2019s that being around drunk people drudges up a lot of painful memories for me.  She just brushed that off though.  \n\nAfter this last time it happened she\u2019s outright fighting me on the issue.   She says this is her home too and we\u2019re both adults.   That I need to get therapy instead of trying to control her.  We had a clear agreement before we moved in though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author has a history of an abusive alcoholic mother, which caused them to not drink and avoid being around drunk people. Their girlfriend knew about this and initially respected the boundary by not drinking around them. When they moved in together, the author asked if the girlfriend could handle not drinking at home, and she agreed it wasn't a problem, suggesting she'd go to a friend's if she wanted to drink. \n\nAt first, that worked, but recently the girlfriend has come home drunk and lied about it. The author confronts her, and sometimes she apologizes, but other times she argues that the author is projecting their mother's issues onto their relationship. The girlfriend now says it's her home too and the author should get therapy instead of trying to control her.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but is unsure. The question is whether the author is wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nFirst, I need to consider boundaries. The author set a clear boundary before moving in, which the girlfriend initially agreed to. The girlfriend's actions of coming home drunk and lying violate that boundary. The author is trying to communicate their needs due to past trauma, which is valid. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend is now pushing back, asserting her own rights as an adult. The author might be overstepping if the boundary was too restrictive, but considering the trauma, it's about creating a safe space. The girlfriend's dishonesty and dismissal of the author's feelings are problematic. \n\nThe key points are: prior agreement, history of trauma, violation of agreed-upon boundaries, and the girlfriend's response. The author is not necessarily in the wrong for setting boundaries to protect their mental health. The girlfriend is not meeting her end of the agreement, so the author is justified in their stance. However, the approach of controlling the girlfriend's behavior might be an issue. It's a balance between respecting each other's autonomy and addressing valid emotional needs. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because they set clear boundaries based on their trauma and the girlfriend agreed to them. The girlfriend is the one breaking the agreement and dismissing the author's needs. So the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
