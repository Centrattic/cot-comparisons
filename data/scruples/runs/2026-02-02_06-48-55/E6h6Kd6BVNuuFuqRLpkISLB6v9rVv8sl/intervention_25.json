It was hell and as a result I don\u2019t drink at all and don\u2019t like being around drunk people.  \n\nWhen I started dating my girlfriend I knew that she drank and discussed my issues with it.  I just asked her that she doesn\u2019t drink around me.  It worked out fine, she was great about not even drunk dialing me, a problem I had with my ex girlfriend.  \n\nWhen we started discussing moving in I was very apprehensive about it.  I asked her if she could really handle not drinking at all in our home and she was adamant that it was no big deal.  That if she wanted to drink she could just spend that night at a friends and that she really didn\u2019t drink that often anyways so it wouldn\u2019t be a problem.  \n\nThe first few months that\u2019s exactly what happened.  Since then though there have been times that she\u2019s come home obviously drunk and just lying about it to me.  I\u2019ve talked her about it to mixed reactions.  Sometimes she will apologize profusely and promise not to let it happen again.   Other times it becomes an argument about how I\u2019m projecting my mother\u2019s problem on our situation.  That she\u2019s not an alcoholic or abusive.  Which is true, but it\u2019s not really about her being abusive, it\u2019s that being around drunk people drudges up a lot of painful memories for me.  She just brushed that off though.  \n\nAfter this last time it happened she\u2019s outright fighting me on the issue.   She says this is her home too and we\u2019re both adults.   That I need to get therapy instead of trying to control her.  We had a clear agreement before we moved in though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. So, the situation is about a relationship where the author has a history of being in a household with an abusive alcoholic mother, which led them to not drink and avoid being around drunk people. They discussed this with their girlfriend when they started dating and she agreed not to drink around them. When they moved in together, they set an agreement that she wouldn't drink at home. Initially, she followed through by going to friends' places if she wanted to drink. But recently, she's been coming home drunk and lying about it. The author is trying to address this, but the girlfriend is now getting defensive, saying the author is projecting and that they need therapy instead of controlling her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective: they have valid trauma from their past, and they made a clear agreement with their partner. The girlfriend agreed to the terms, so when she breaks them, it's understandable the author is upset. The girlfriend's perspective is that they're both adults and the author is being controlling. But the author isn't trying to control her; they're setting boundaries for their own well-being.\n\nThe key points here are the initial agreement, the girlfriend breaking it, and the author's right to set boundaries based on their trauma. The girlfriend's defensiveness and refusal to acknowledge the impact of her actions could be an issue. The author isn't asking the girlfriend to stop drinking entirely, just to not drink in the home where they are present. That's a reasonable boundary, especially given their history. The girlfriend's response of \"get therapy\" might be dismissive, implying the author's feelings aren't valid. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The answer would be No (B) because they're within their rights to set boundaries for their comfort and mental health. The girlfriend is the one not honoring the agreement and not respecting the author's needs. The author isn't being controlling; they're addressing a legitimate issue from their past. The girlfriend's actions are the problem here, not the author's request.\n"
