It was hell and as a result I don\u2019t drink at all and don\u2019t like being around drunk people.  \n\nWhen I started dating my girlfriend I knew that she drank and discussed my issues with it.  I just asked her that she doesn\u2019t drink around me.  It worked out fine, she was great about not even drunk dialing me, a problem I had with my ex girlfriend.  \n\nWhen we started discussing moving in I was very apprehensive about it.  I asked her if she could really handle not drinking at all in our home and she was adamant that it was no big deal.  That if she wanted to drink she could just spend that night at a friends and that she really didn\u2019t drink that often anyways so it wouldn\u2019t be a problem.  \n\nThe first few months that\u2019s exactly what happened.  Since then though there have been times that she\u2019s come home obviously drunk and just lying about it to me.  I\u2019ve talked her about it to mixed reactions.  Sometimes she will apologize profusely and promise not to let it happen again.   Other times it becomes an argument about how I\u2019m projecting my mother\u2019s problem on our situation.  That she\u2019s not an alcoholic or abusive.  Which is true, but it\u2019s not really about her being abusive, it\u2019s that being around drunk people drudges up a lot of painful memories for me.  She just brushed that off though.  \n\nAfter this last time it happened she\u2019s outright fighting me on the issue.   She says this is her home too and we\u2019re both adults.   That I need to get therapy instead of trying to control her.  We had a clear agreement before we moved in though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a relationship where the author has a history of being raised by an alcoholic mother and now their girlfriend drinks around them despite previous agreements.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author's main issue is that they can't handle being around drunk people due to their past. They discussed this with their girlfriend before moving in, and she agreed to not drink at home. However, she's been breaking that agreement by coming home drunk and lying about it. The author has tried talking to her, but she's defensive, says the author is projecting, and now argues that it's her home too and the author should get therapy instead.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the author set boundaries based on their trauma and communicated them upfront. The girlfriend agreed but later didn't follow through. The author's actions seem reasonable given their history. The girlfriend is not respecting the agreed-upon boundaries, which is a problem. The fact that the author is trying to address it while the girlfriend is defensive and dismissive might indicate that she's not taking the issue seriously. \n\nBut wait, does the author have the right to expect someone else to abstain from drinking in their shared home? It's a mutual space, so maybe the author should have considered that. However, considering the author's trauma, it's a valid reason to set that boundary. The girlfriend's response of blaming the author and refusing to comply might be the bigger issue here.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries based on their past and trying to communicate them. The problem lies with the girlfriend not respecting those boundaries and becoming confrontational. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
