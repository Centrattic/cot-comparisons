It was hell and as a result I don\u2019t drink at all and don\u2019t like being around drunk people.  \n\nWhen I started dating my girlfriend I knew that she drank and discussed my issues with it.  I just asked her that she doesn\u2019t drink around me.  It worked out fine, she was great about not even drunk dialing me, a problem I had with my ex girlfriend.  \n\nWhen we started discussing moving in I was very apprehensive about it.  I asked her if she could really handle not drinking at all in our home and she was adamant that it was no big deal.  That if she wanted to drink she could just spend that night at a friends and that she really didn\u2019t drink that often anyways so it wouldn\u2019t be a problem.  \n\nThe first few months that\u2019s exactly what happened.  Since then though there have been times that she\u2019s come home obviously drunk and just lying about it to me.  I\u2019ve talked her about it to mixed reactions.  Sometimes she will apologize profusely and promise not to let it happen again.   Other times it becomes an argument about how I\u2019m projecting my mother\u2019s problem on our situation.  That she\u2019s not an alcoholic or abusive.  Which is true, but it\u2019s not really about her being abusive, it\u2019s that being around drunk people drudges up a lot of painful memories for me.  She just brushed that off though.  \n\nAfter this last time it happened she\u2019s outright fighting me on the issue.   She says this is her home too and we\u2019re both adults.   That I need to get therapy instead of trying to control her.  We had a clear agreement before we moved in though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's girlfriend drinking, which triggers bad memories from his abusive alcoholic mother. They had an agreement before moving in that she wouldn't drink around him, but she's been breaking it and lying. The author feels it's about his trauma, but she's arguing it's his projection and that he should get therapy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the boundaries they set. The author had a clear agreement with his girlfriend before moving in. She agreed not to drink at home, but she's been coming home drunk and lying. That seems like a violation of their agreement. The author's trauma is valid, and he's not asking her to completely stop drinking, just to avoid it around him. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend argues that it's her home too and that they're adults. But they had an agreement. The author isn't trying to control her per se, just respecting his own boundaries. The girlfriend's lying and not respecting the agreement is a problem. \n\nBut maybe the author should have considered other ways to handle it? Like setting boundaries that don't restrict her entirely, or seeking couples counseling? But the author's main issue is that being around drunk people triggers his trauma. That's a valid reason for him to ask for this boundary. The girlfriend's response seems dismissive of his feelings and the agreement they made. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He's trying to maintain his mental health by respecting his past trauma. The girlfriend isn't respecting their agreement, which is her fault. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
