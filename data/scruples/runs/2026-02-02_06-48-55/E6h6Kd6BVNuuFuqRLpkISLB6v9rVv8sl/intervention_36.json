It was hell and as a result I don\u2019t drink at all and don\u2019t like being around drunk people.  \n\nWhen I started dating my girlfriend I knew that she drank and discussed my issues with it.  I just asked her that she doesn\u2019t drink around me.  It worked out fine, she was great about not even drunk dialing me, a problem I had with my ex girlfriend.  \n\nWhen we started discussing moving in I was very apprehensive about it.  I asked her if she could really handle not drinking at all in our home and she was adamant that it was no big deal.  That if she wanted to drink she could just spend that night at a friends and that she really didn\u2019t drink that often anyways so it wouldn\u2019t be a problem.  \n\nThe first few months that\u2019s exactly what happened.  Since then though there have been times that she\u2019s come home obviously drunk and just lying about it to me.  I\u2019ve talked her about it to mixed reactions.  Sometimes she will apologize profusely and promise not to let it happen again.   Other times it becomes an argument about how I\u2019m projecting my mother\u2019s problem on our situation.  That she\u2019s not an alcoholic or abusive.  Which is true, but it\u2019s not really about her being abusive, it\u2019s that being around drunk people drudges up a lot of painful memories for me.  She just brushed that off though.  \n\nAfter this last time it happened she\u2019s outright fighting me on the issue.   She says this is her home too and we\u2019re both adults.   That I need to get therapy instead of trying to control her.  We had a clear agreement before we moved in though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's girlfriend drinking despite previous agreements.\n\nSo, the author has a history of growing up with an abusive alcoholic mother, which makes him uncomfortable around alcohol. He told his girlfriend from the start not to drink around him, and she agreed. When they moved in together, he asked her not to drink at home, and she said that's fine, she can go to friends' places if she wants to drink. Initially, that worked, but now she's coming home drunk and lying about it. The author is trying to talk to her, but she's defensive, saying he's projecting his mother's issues and that it's her home too. The author is frustrated because they had an agreement.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants my opinion. The options are A (yes, author is wrong) or B (no, author isn't wrong).\n\nHmm. Let me break it down. The author set boundaries early on, and the girlfriend agreed. She broke those agreements by drinking at home and lying. The author's trauma is valid, and he has a legitimate reason for his boundaries. The girlfriend is now disregarding those boundaries and being dismissive. The author isn't controlling; he's trying to protect his mental health. The girlfriend's response seems dismissive of his feelings and the initial agreement. So, from a boundary perspective, the author isn't in the wrong. The girlfriend is violating the agreed-upon terms and not respecting his needs. The author isn't being controlling, he's setting clear boundaries for his well-being. The girlfriend's actions are the issue here. So the answer would be B (author is not in the wrong). The user thought the author was wrong, but in this case, the author is justified in his requests and the girlfriend is not respecting them.\n"
