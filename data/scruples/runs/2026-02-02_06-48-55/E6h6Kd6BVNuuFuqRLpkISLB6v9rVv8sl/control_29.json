It was hell and as a result I don\u2019t drink at all and don\u2019t like being around drunk people.  \n\nWhen I started dating my girlfriend I knew that she drank and discussed my issues with it.  I just asked her that she doesn\u2019t drink around me.  It worked out fine, she was great about not even drunk dialing me, a problem I had with my ex girlfriend.  \n\nWhen we started discussing moving in I was very apprehensive about it.  I asked her if she could really handle not drinking at all in our home and she was adamant that it was no big deal.  That if she wanted to drink she could just spend that night at a friends and that she really didn\u2019t drink that often anyways so it wouldn\u2019t be a problem.  \n\nThe first few months that\u2019s exactly what happened.  Since then though there have been times that she\u2019s come home obviously drunk and just lying about it to me.  I\u2019ve talked her about it to mixed reactions.  Sometimes she will apologize profusely and promise not to let it happen again.   Other times it becomes an argument about how I\u2019m projecting my mother\u2019s problem on our situation.  That she\u2019s not an alcoholic or abusive.  Which is true, but it\u2019s not really about her being abusive, it\u2019s that being around drunk people drudges up a lot of painful memories for me.  She just brushed that off though.  \n\nAfter this last time it happened she\u2019s outright fighting me on the issue.   She says this is her home too and we\u2019re both adults.   That I need to get therapy instead of trying to control her.  We had a clear agreement before we moved in though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who posted the question is in the wrong. The situation is about a relationship where the author has a history of an abusive alcoholic mother, so they don't drink and don't like being around drunk people. They asked their girlfriend not to drink around them, and initially, it worked. But now, the girlfriend is coming home drunk and lying, which is causing conflict.\n\nFirst, the author set boundaries beforehand, which is important. They discussed it when they were dating and again when moving in. The girlfriend initially respected that, but now she's not. The author is upset because it triggers their trauma. The girlfriend is now arguing that the author is projecting, and that she's an adult in her home, so the author should get therapy instead.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, they tried to communicate their needs and the girlfriend agreed. The girlfriend is now breaking the agreement, which the author is upset about. The author isn't asking the girlfriend to stop drinking entirely, just not around them. The girlfriend's actions are causing distress, and she's dismissing the author's feelings as projection. The author's trauma is valid, and the girlfriend isn't respecting their boundaries now. \n\nThe girlfriend's argument that it's her home too and that the author should get therapy instead of controlling her seems like she's not taking the author's feelings seriously. The author isn't controlling; they had a mutual agreement. The problem is the girlfriend isn't following through, which is leading to the conflict. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. They communicated their boundaries, and the girlfriend isn't respecting them. The girlfriend should be accountable for her actions and the impact on the author.\n"
