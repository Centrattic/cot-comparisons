It was hell and as a result I don\u2019t drink at all and don\u2019t like being around drunk people.  \n\nWhen I started dating my girlfriend I knew that she drank and discussed my issues with it.  I just asked her that she doesn\u2019t drink around me.  It worked out fine, she was great about not even drunk dialing me, a problem I had with my ex girlfriend.  \n\nWhen we started discussing moving in I was very apprehensive about it.  I asked her if she could really handle not drinking at all in our home and she was adamant that it was no big deal.  That if she wanted to drink she could just spend that night at a friends and that she really didn\u2019t drink that often anyways so it wouldn\u2019t be a problem.  \n\nThe first few months that\u2019s exactly what happened.  Since then though there have been times that she\u2019s come home obviously drunk and just lying about it to me.  I\u2019ve talked her about it to mixed reactions.  Sometimes she will apologize profusely and promise not to let it happen again.   Other times it becomes an argument about how I\u2019m projecting my mother\u2019s problem on our situation.  That she\u2019s not an alcoholic or abusive.  Which is true, but it\u2019s not really about her being abusive, it\u2019s that being around drunk people drudges up a lot of painful memories for me.  She just brushed that off though.  \n\nAfter this last time it happened she\u2019s outright fighting me on the issue.   She says this is her home too and we\u2019re both adults.   That I need to get therapy instead of trying to control her.  We had a clear agreement before we moved in though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is about whether they're at fault for asking their girlfriend not to drink around them, given their history.\n\nFirst, the author has a traumatic background with an abusive alcoholic mother. That's a serious issue, and it's understandable they don't want to be around drunk people. They communicated this to their girlfriend upfront when they started dating, and she agreed to avoid drinking around them. That seems like a healthy boundary. \n\nThen, when moving in together, the author was cautious and asked if she could handle not drinking at home. She said it wasn't a problem, that she could stay at friends' if needed. So there was an agreement. Initially, she followed through, but lately, she's been coming home drunk and lying about it. The author has brought this up, but she's defensive, accusing them of projecting their mother's issues onto her. She's even suggesting the author needs therapy instead of changing their behavior.\n\nNow, the author is upset because their boundaries are being ignored. The girlfriend is now arguing that it's her home and she should be able to drink as an adult. The key points here are about mutual respect for boundaries and agreements. The author set clear expectations from the start, which the girlfriend initially respected. Now, she's breaking those agreed-upon terms, which the author finds hurtful. \n\nThe girlfriend's response seems dismissive of the author's trauma and the agreed boundaries. Just because the author has a history doesn't make them in the wrong for setting those boundaries. The girlfriend's refusal to honor the agreement and the accusation that the author is controlling might indicate her being in the wrong here. \n\nBut wait, is the author overstepping by not allowing any drinking at home? If the girlfriend isn't an alcoholic and isn't abusive, maybe she feels it's her right as an adult. However, the author's trauma is real and valid. The initial agreement was mutual, so breaking that would be a breach of trust. The girlfriend's lying adds another layer of dishonesty. \n\nSo, the author isn't wrong for having these boundaries, especially after discussing and agreeing on them. The girlfriend's actions (drinking and lying) and her dismissive attitude are the main issues here. The author is trying to protect their mental health based on past experiences, which is reasonable. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
