It was hell and as a result I don\u2019t drink at all and don\u2019t like being around drunk people.  \n\nWhen I started dating my girlfriend I knew that she drank and discussed my issues with it.  I just asked her that she doesn\u2019t drink around me.  It worked out fine, she was great about not even drunk dialing me, a problem I had with my ex girlfriend.  \n\nWhen we started discussing moving in I was very apprehensive about it.  I asked her if she could really handle not drinking at all in our home and she was adamant that it was no big deal.  That if she wanted to drink she could just spend that night at a friends and that she really didn\u2019t drink that often anyways so it wouldn\u2019t be a problem.  \n\nThe first few months that\u2019s exactly what happened.  Since then though there have been times that she\u2019s come home obviously drunk and just lying about it to me.  I\u2019ve talked her about it to mixed reactions.  Sometimes she will apologize profusely and promise not to let it happen again.   Other times it becomes an argument about how I\u2019m projecting my mother\u2019s problem on our situation.  That she\u2019s not an alcoholic or abusive.  Which is true, but it\u2019s not really about her being abusive, it\u2019s that being around drunk people drudges up a lot of painful memories for me.  She just brushed that off though.  \n\nAfter this last time it happened she\u2019s outright fighting me on the issue.   She says this is her home too and we\u2019re both adults.   That I need to get therapy instead of trying to control her.  We had a clear agreement before we moved in though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole?) scenario is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the background: The author has a traumatic history with an abusive alcoholic mother. Because of this, they don't drink and don't like being around drunk people. When they started dating their girlfriend, they discussed this and she agreed to avoid drinking around them. Initially, she respected that. However, after moving in together, there are instances where she comes home drunk and lies about it. The author has tried talking to her, but she gets defensive, compares it to the author's ex, and even says the author needs therapy instead of controlling her.\n\nSo the key points here are:\n\n1. The author has legitimate trauma from their past.\n2. There was an agreement beforehand that she wouldn't drink in their home.\n3. She's breaking that agreement by coming home drunk and lying.\n4. She's dismissing the author's feelings and being confrontational.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for asking her to stop drinking. The author isn't asking her not to drink in general, just in their shared home. They've had an agreement, and she's violating it. The author's issue is about their own comfort and mental health, not about controlling their partner, despite the girlfriend's argument. \n\nThe girlfriend is breaking a prior agreement, which is a problem. The author's request isn't about her drinking in public or private, but in their home, which they had discussed. The author's trauma is valid, and they have a right to a safe environment. The girlfriend's reaction seems dismissive and disrespectful of the author's boundaries.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't wrong for setting boundaries based on their trauma. The girlfriend is in the wrong for not respecting those boundaries and arguing about it instead of finding a compromise. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
