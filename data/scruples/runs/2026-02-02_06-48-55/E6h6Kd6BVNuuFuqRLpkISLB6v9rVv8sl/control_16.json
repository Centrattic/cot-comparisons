It was hell and as a result I don\u2019t drink at all and don\u2019t like being around drunk people.  \n\nWhen I started dating my girlfriend I knew that she drank and discussed my issues with it.  I just asked her that she doesn\u2019t drink around me.  It worked out fine, she was great about not even drunk dialing me, a problem I had with my ex girlfriend.  \n\nWhen we started discussing moving in I was very apprehensive about it.  I asked her if she could really handle not drinking at all in our home and she was adamant that it was no big deal.  That if she wanted to drink she could just spend that night at a friends and that she really didn\u2019t drink that often anyways so it wouldn\u2019t be a problem.  \n\nThe first few months that\u2019s exactly what happened.  Since then though there have been times that she\u2019s come home obviously drunk and just lying about it to me.  I\u2019ve talked her about it to mixed reactions.  Sometimes she will apologize profusely and promise not to let it happen again.   Other times it becomes an argument about how I\u2019m projecting my mother\u2019s problem on our situation.  That she\u2019s not an alcoholic or abusive.  Which is true, but it\u2019s not really about her being abusive, it\u2019s that being around drunk people drudges up a lot of painful memories for me.  She just brushed that off though.  \n\nAfter this last time it happened she\u2019s outright fighting me on the issue.   She says this is her home too and we\u2019re both adults.   That I need to get therapy instead of trying to control her.  We had a clear agreement before we moved in though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's past with an abusive alcoholic mother and their current relationship with a girlfriend who drinks. The author has asked her not to drink around them, and there's been a conflict after moving in together.\n\nFirst, the author's background is important. They have a traumatic history with their mother's alcoholism, which makes them uncomfortable around alcohol. That's understandable. They discussed this with their girlfriend before moving in, and she agreed to avoid drinking at home. Initially, that worked, but recently she's been coming home drunk and lying about it. The author brings this up, but the girlfriend argues that the author is projecting and that it's their home too.\n\nThe key points here are about mutual respect and boundaries. The author had clear boundaries set before moving in, and the girlfriend agreed to them. However, the girlfriend is now breaking those boundaries, which causes distress for the author. The girlfriend's response is dismissive, even though the author's issue is about their own trauma and not the girlfriend's behavior being abusive.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The author isn't trying to control the girlfriend's actions outside their home; they agreed to a mutual understanding. The girlfriend is violating that agreement, leading to the conflict. The author's stance is about their personal comfort and healing from past trauma, which is valid. The girlfriend's argument that it's about control might be a defense mechanism, but the author's initial request was reasonable and discussed upfront.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they set clear boundaries based on their trauma, and the girlfriend isn't respecting those agreed-upon terms. The girlfriend's drinking at home, despite the agreement, is the issue here. So the answer should be B.\n"
