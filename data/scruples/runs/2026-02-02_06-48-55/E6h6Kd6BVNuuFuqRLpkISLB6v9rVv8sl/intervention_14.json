It was hell and as a result I don\u2019t drink at all and don\u2019t like being around drunk people.  \n\nWhen I started dating my girlfriend I knew that she drank and discussed my issues with it.  I just asked her that she doesn\u2019t drink around me.  It worked out fine, she was great about not even drunk dialing me, a problem I had with my ex girlfriend.  \n\nWhen we started discussing moving in I was very apprehensive about it.  I asked her if she could really handle not drinking at all in our home and she was adamant that it was no big deal.  That if she wanted to drink she could just spend that night at a friends and that she really didn\u2019t drink that often anyways so it wouldn\u2019t be a problem.  \n\nThe first few months that\u2019s exactly what happened.  Since then though there have been times that she\u2019s come home obviously drunk and just lying about it to me.  I\u2019ve talked her about it to mixed reactions.  Sometimes she will apologize profusely and promise not to let it happen again.   Other times it becomes an argument about how I\u2019m projecting my mother\u2019s problem on our situation.  That she\u2019s not an alcoholic or abusive.  Which is true, but it\u2019s not really about her being abusive, it\u2019s that being around drunk people drudges up a lot of painful memories for me.  She just brushed that off though.  \n\nAfter this last time it happened she\u2019s outright fighting me on the issue.   She says this is her home too and we\u2019re both adults.   That I need to get therapy instead of trying to control her.  We had a clear agreement before we moved in though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's girlfriend drinking despite their previous agreement not to. The author has a history with an abusive alcoholic mother, which makes them uncomfortable around drunk people. They asked the girlfriend to avoid drinking around them, and initially, she respected that. But now she's coming home drunk and lying about it, leading to conflicts.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is rooted in their personal trauma and the agreement they had before moving in. They communicated their needs clearly and the girlfriend agreed. However, the girlfriend is now violating that agreement, which is causing distress. On the other hand, the girlfriend argues that it's her home too and that the author is projecting their mother's issues onto her. She's an adult, so she might feel her autonomy is being restricted.\n\nThe author isn't saying the girlfriend is an alcoholic or abusive, just that being around drunk people triggers bad memories. The girlfriend's actions are breaking the mutual agreement they made, which is a breach of trust. The author is trying to set boundaries based on their mental health. However, the girlfriend's pushback could be about mutual respect and compromise. But since they had an agreement, the girlfriend is the one not following through. The author isn't controlling; they set a clear boundary beforehand. The girlfriend's refusal to honor that agreement might make her the one at fault here. The author's request is reasonable given their history, and the girlfriend isn't respecting that. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
