It was hell and as a result I don\u2019t drink at all and don\u2019t like being around drunk people.  \n\nWhen I started dating my girlfriend I knew that she drank and discussed my issues with it.  I just asked her that she doesn\u2019t drink around me.  It worked out fine, she was great about not even drunk dialing me, a problem I had with my ex girlfriend.  \n\nWhen we started discussing moving in I was very apprehensive about it.  I asked her if she could really handle not drinking at all in our home and she was adamant that it was no big deal.  That if she wanted to drink she could just spend that night at a friends and that she really didn\u2019t drink that often anyways so it wouldn\u2019t be a problem.  \n\nThe first few months that\u2019s exactly what happened.  Since then though there have been times that she\u2019s come home obviously drunk and just lying about it to me.  I\u2019ve talked her about it to mixed reactions.  Sometimes she will apologize profusely and promise not to let it happen again.   Other times it becomes an argument about how I\u2019m projecting my mother\u2019s problem on our situation.  That she\u2019s not an alcoholic or abusive.  Which is true, but it\u2019s not really about her being abusive, it\u2019s that being around drunk people drudges up a lot of painful memories for me.  She just brushed that off though.  \n\nAfter this last time it happened she\u2019s outright fighting me on the issue.   She says this is her home too and we\u2019re both adults.   That I need to get therapy instead of trying to control her.  We had a clear agreement before we moved in though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking his girlfriend not to drink around him. The author has a history of growing up with an abusive alcoholic mother, which makes him uncomfortable around drunk people. He asked his girlfriend not to drink around him, and she agreed initially. Now, she's been coming home drunk and lying about it, which is causing conflict.\n\nFirst, the author's request seems reasonable given his trauma. He's not asking her to stop drinking entirely, just not around him. That's a valid boundary. The girlfriend agreed to this before moving in. But now, she's breaking that agreement, which is a problem. The author is trying to address it, but she's dismissing his feelings and accusing him of projecting his mother's issues. She's also saying it's her home too and that he should get therapy instead of controlling her.\n\nThe key points here are mutual respect and agreed boundaries. The author set clear boundaries based on his personal history, which the girlfriend initially respected. Now, she's violating those boundaries, which is a breach of trust. The girlfriend's reaction seems dismissive and invalidating, which is not healthy. The author is trying to communicate his needs, which is important in a relationship. The girlfriend is not honoring the agreement they made, which is a bigger issue. So, the problem isn't with the author asking her not to drink around him, but with her not respecting that agreement. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
