It was hell and as a result I don\u2019t drink at all and don\u2019t like being around drunk people.  \n\nWhen I started dating my girlfriend I knew that she drank and discussed my issues with it.  I just asked her that she doesn\u2019t drink around me.  It worked out fine, she was great about not even drunk dialing me, a problem I had with my ex girlfriend.  \n\nWhen we started discussing moving in I was very apprehensive about it.  I asked her if she could really handle not drinking at all in our home and she was adamant that it was no big deal.  That if she wanted to drink she could just spend that night at a friends and that she really didn\u2019t drink that often anyways so it wouldn\u2019t be a problem.  \n\nThe first few months that\u2019s exactly what happened.  Since then though there have been times that she\u2019s come home obviously drunk and just lying about it to me.  I\u2019ve talked her about it to mixed reactions.  Sometimes she will apologize profusely and promise not to let it happen again.   Other times it becomes an argument about how I\u2019m projecting my mother\u2019s problem on our situation.  That she\u2019s not an alcoholic or abusive.  Which is true, but it\u2019s not really about her being abusive, it\u2019s that being around drunk people drudges up a lot of painful memories for me.  She just brushed that off though.  \n\nAfter this last time it happened she\u2019s outright fighting me on the issue.   She says this is her home too and we\u2019re both adults.   That I need to get therapy instead of trying to control her.  We had a clear agreement before we moved in though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation involves a romantic relationship where the author has a history of trauma related to an abusive alcoholic mother. The author communicates their boundaries to their partner about not drinking around them. The partner agreed before moving in but now is violating that boundary by coming home drunk and lying. The author confronts her, but she's defensive, says it's about projection, and even accuses the author of controlling her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They have valid trauma and established clear boundaries. They communicated these to their partner before moving in, and the partner initially respected them. The author is now facing repeated violations of those boundaries. The partner's response is dismissive, comparing the author to their abusive mother, which is a common tactic in relationships where boundaries are being disrespected. The partner is also claiming the author is controlling, which can be a red flag in relationships.\n\nOn the other hand, the partner might have their own perspective. She's an adult and might feel her freedom is being restricted. She claims she doesn't drink often and can handle it, but the author's well-being is more important. The key here is that the author's boundaries were communicated beforehand, and the partner agreed. When she repeatedly breaks those agreed-upon boundaries, it's a problem. The author's issue isn't about controlling but about their mental health and trauma. The partner's defensiveness and invalidation of the author's feelings suggest that the problem is on her side.\n\nThe author isn't in the wrong. They have a right to their boundaries, especially when it's about their mental health and past trauma. The partner is the one not respecting the agreed terms and dismissing the author's legitimate concerns. The author's actions are about protecting themselves, which is reasonable. The partner's behavior is the issue here, not the author's request.\n"
