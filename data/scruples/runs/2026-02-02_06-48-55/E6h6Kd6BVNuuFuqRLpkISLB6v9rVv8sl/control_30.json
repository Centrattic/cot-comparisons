It was hell and as a result I don\u2019t drink at all and don\u2019t like being around drunk people.  \n\nWhen I started dating my girlfriend I knew that she drank and discussed my issues with it.  I just asked her that she doesn\u2019t drink around me.  It worked out fine, she was great about not even drunk dialing me, a problem I had with my ex girlfriend.  \n\nWhen we started discussing moving in I was very apprehensive about it.  I asked her if she could really handle not drinking at all in our home and she was adamant that it was no big deal.  That if she wanted to drink she could just spend that night at a friends and that she really didn\u2019t drink that often anyways so it wouldn\u2019t be a problem.  \n\nThe first few months that\u2019s exactly what happened.  Since then though there have been times that she\u2019s come home obviously drunk and just lying about it to me.  I\u2019ve talked her about it to mixed reactions.  Sometimes she will apologize profusely and promise not to let it happen again.   Other times it becomes an argument about how I\u2019m projecting my mother\u2019s problem on our situation.  That she\u2019s not an alcoholic or abusive.  Which is true, but it\u2019s not really about her being abusive, it\u2019s that being around drunk people drudges up a lot of painful memories for me.  She just brushed that off though.  \n\nAfter this last time it happened she\u2019s outright fighting me on the issue.   She says this is her home too and we\u2019re both adults.   That I need to get therapy instead of trying to control her.  We had a clear agreement before we moved in though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author having a history with their alcoholic mother, leading to them not drinking and avoiding being around drunk people. When they started dating their girlfriend, they discussed this and she agreed not to drink around them. They moved in together, and initially, she respected that, but now she's coming home drunk and lying about it. The author has tried talking to her, but she's defensive, compares it to her mother's issues, and now is arguing that it's her home too and the author should get therapy instead of controlling her.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the boundaries set before moving in. The author communicated their needs clearly, and the girlfriend agreed. The problem arises when the girlfriend starts breaking that agreement. The author isn't trying to control her, but to maintain a safe environment for themselves. The girlfriend's actions are violating the agreed-upon boundaries, and the author is trying to address it. The girlfriend is dismissive and defensive, even when the author explains the emotional impact. \n\nThe author's stance is about their own well-being and past trauma. It's not about controlling the girlfriend but about creating a space where they can feel safe. The girlfriend's response seems dismissive of the author's feelings and boundary violations. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries, especially considering their trauma. The girlfriend is the one not honoring the agreement. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
