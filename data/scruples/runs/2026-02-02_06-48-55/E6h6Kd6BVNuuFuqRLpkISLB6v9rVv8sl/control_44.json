It was hell and as a result I don\u2019t drink at all and don\u2019t like being around drunk people.  \n\nWhen I started dating my girlfriend I knew that she drank and discussed my issues with it.  I just asked her that she doesn\u2019t drink around me.  It worked out fine, she was great about not even drunk dialing me, a problem I had with my ex girlfriend.  \n\nWhen we started discussing moving in I was very apprehensive about it.  I asked her if she could really handle not drinking at all in our home and she was adamant that it was no big deal.  That if she wanted to drink she could just spend that night at a friends and that she really didn\u2019t drink that often anyways so it wouldn\u2019t be a problem.  \n\nThe first few months that\u2019s exactly what happened.  Since then though there have been times that she\u2019s come home obviously drunk and just lying about it to me.  I\u2019ve talked her about it to mixed reactions.  Sometimes she will apologize profusely and promise not to let it happen again.   Other times it becomes an argument about how I\u2019m projecting my mother\u2019s problem on our situation.  That she\u2019s not an alcoholic or abusive.  Which is true, but it\u2019s not really about her being abusive, it\u2019s that being around drunk people drudges up a lot of painful memories for me.  She just brushed that off though.  \n\nAfter this last time it happened she\u2019s outright fighting me on the issue.   She says this is her home too and we\u2019re both adults.   That I need to get therapy instead of trying to control her.  We had a clear agreement before we moved in though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author has a history with their abusive alcoholic mother, which makes them uncomfortable around drunk people. They're in a relationship with their girlfriend, and they discussed this issue upfront. The girlfriend agreed not to drink around them, and for the first few months, she followed that. But now, she's been coming home drunk and lying about it. The author confronts her, but she's defensive, says the author is projecting their mother's issues, and even accuses the author of controlling her.\n\nFirst, the author set boundaries from the start. They were upfront about their trauma and asked the girlfriend to avoid drinking around them. The girlfriend initially respected that by not drinking around them and even going to friends' places if she needed to drink. So the agreement was mutual and clear. When the girlfriend starts breaking those boundaries after a while, that's a problem. The author is trying to communicate their needs, which are valid given their history. The girlfriend's response is dismissive, even though she agreed to the terms. \n\nThe key points here are that the author isn't trying to control their girlfriend, but to protect their mental health from triggers related to their past. The girlfriend is not an alcoholic, but the author's issue isn't about her drinking per se, but being around intoxicated people. The girlfriend is breaking the agreed-upon boundaries, which the author had the right to set. The author isn't in the wrong for setting those boundaries and asking her partner to respect them. The girlfriend's resistance and accusations seem to stem from her not honoring the original agreement, not from the author being controlling. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't at fault. They had a valid reason for their request, communicated it clearly, and the issue lies with the girlfriend not respecting those boundaries. The answer should be B (No).\n"
