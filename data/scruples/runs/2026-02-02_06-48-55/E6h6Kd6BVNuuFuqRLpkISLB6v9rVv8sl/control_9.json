It was hell and as a result I don\u2019t drink at all and don\u2019t like being around drunk people.  \n\nWhen I started dating my girlfriend I knew that she drank and discussed my issues with it.  I just asked her that she doesn\u2019t drink around me.  It worked out fine, she was great about not even drunk dialing me, a problem I had with my ex girlfriend.  \n\nWhen we started discussing moving in I was very apprehensive about it.  I asked her if she could really handle not drinking at all in our home and she was adamant that it was no big deal.  That if she wanted to drink she could just spend that night at a friends and that she really didn\u2019t drink that often anyways so it wouldn\u2019t be a problem.  \n\nThe first few months that\u2019s exactly what happened.  Since then though there have been times that she\u2019s come home obviously drunk and just lying about it to me.  I\u2019ve talked her about it to mixed reactions.  Sometimes she will apologize profusely and promise not to let it happen again.   Other times it becomes an argument about how I\u2019m projecting my mother\u2019s problem on our situation.  That she\u2019s not an alcoholic or abusive.  Which is true, but it\u2019s not really about her being abusive, it\u2019s that being around drunk people drudges up a lot of painful memories for me.  She just brushed that off though.  \n\nAfter this last time it happened she\u2019s outright fighting me on the issue.   She says this is her home too and we\u2019re both adults.   That I need to get therapy instead of trying to control her.  We had a clear agreement before we moved in though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" question is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's girlfriend drinking despite previous agreements.\n\nFirst, the author has a history with an abusive alcoholic mother, so they don't drink and don't like being around drunk people. They discussed this with their girlfriend before moving in and agreed that she wouldn't drink at home. Initially, she respected that, but now she's coming home drunk and lying about it. The author confronts her, but she gets defensive, says it's her home too, and suggests the author needs therapy.\n\nSo, the key points here: the author communicated their boundaries clearly, which the girlfriend agreed to. Now, the girlfriend is breaking those agreed-upon terms. The author is trying to maintain their mental health by avoiding triggers, which is understandable. The girlfriend isn't respecting the initial agreement and is dismissing the author's feelings as projection.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? They set boundaries that were agreed upon. The girlfriend is violating those boundaries. The author's actions are about their own well-being, not controlling the girlfriend. The girlfriend is the one changing her behavior after the agreement. So the author isn't in the wrong; the girlfriend is not honoring the terms. The answer should be B (No).\n"
