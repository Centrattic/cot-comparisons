It was hell and as a result I don\u2019t drink at all and don\u2019t like being around drunk people.  \n\nWhen I started dating my girlfriend I knew that she drank and discussed my issues with it.  I just asked her that she doesn\u2019t drink around me.  It worked out fine, she was great about not even drunk dialing me, a problem I had with my ex girlfriend.  \n\nWhen we started discussing moving in I was very apprehensive about it.  I asked her if she could really handle not drinking at all in our home and she was adamant that it was no big deal.  That if she wanted to drink she could just spend that night at a friends and that she really didn\u2019t drink that often anyways so it wouldn\u2019t be a problem.  \n\nThe first few months that\u2019s exactly what happened.  Since then though there have been times that she\u2019s come home obviously drunk and just lying about it to me.  I\u2019ve talked her about it to mixed reactions.  Sometimes she will apologize profusely and promise not to let it happen again.   Other times it becomes an argument about how I\u2019m projecting my mother\u2019s problem on our situation.  That she\u2019s not an alcoholic or abusive.  Which is true, but it\u2019s not really about her being abusive, it\u2019s that being around drunk people drudges up a lot of painful memories for me.  She just brushed that off though.  \n\nAfter this last time it happened she\u2019s outright fighting me on the issue.   She says this is her home too and we\u2019re both adults.   That I need to get therapy instead of trying to control her.  We had a clear agreement before we moved in though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's girlfriend drinking despite previous agreements not to, leading to arguments.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has a history of abuse from an alcoholic mother, which explains their aversion to alcohol. They communicated their boundaries upfront, and the girlfriend agreed. But later, the girlfriend started drinking around the author and lying about it.\n\nThe author is in a difficult position because their trauma is being invalidated. The girlfriend is dismissing the author's feelings, comparing it to projecting their mother's issues. The author's main issue isn't abuse but the emotional distress caused by being around drunk people. The girlfriend is now arguing that the author is controlling and suggests therapy instead of respecting the prior agreement.\n\nOn one hand, the girlfriend broke an agreement they both made before moving in. She agreed to handle not drinking at home, but she's now not following through and is dismissive of the author's feelings. The author is trying to maintain a safe environment for themselves based on past trauma, which should be respected.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend argues that they're both adults and the author should deal with their issues. However, the author's boundaries were set before moving in, so the girlfriend's actions are violating that agreement. The girlfriend's response of suggesting therapy might be a way to deflect from the broken agreement.\n\nThe key points are consent and boundaries. The author communicated their needs clearly, and the girlfriend agreed. Breaking that agreement without valid reasons, especially while dismissing the other person's trauma, seems unfair. The author isn't controlling; they're upholding a mutual agreement. The girlfriend's behavior is the issue here because she's not respecting the prior arrangement and is invalidating the author's feelings.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
