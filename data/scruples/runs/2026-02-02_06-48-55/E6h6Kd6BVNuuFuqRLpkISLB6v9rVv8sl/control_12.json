It was hell and as a result I don\u2019t drink at all and don\u2019t like being around drunk people.  \n\nWhen I started dating my girlfriend I knew that she drank and discussed my issues with it.  I just asked her that she doesn\u2019t drink around me.  It worked out fine, she was great about not even drunk dialing me, a problem I had with my ex girlfriend.  \n\nWhen we started discussing moving in I was very apprehensive about it.  I asked her if she could really handle not drinking at all in our home and she was adamant that it was no big deal.  That if she wanted to drink she could just spend that night at a friends and that she really didn\u2019t drink that often anyways so it wouldn\u2019t be a problem.  \n\nThe first few months that\u2019s exactly what happened.  Since then though there have been times that she\u2019s come home obviously drunk and just lying about it to me.  I\u2019ve talked her about it to mixed reactions.  Sometimes she will apologize profusely and promise not to let it happen again.   Other times it becomes an argument about how I\u2019m projecting my mother\u2019s problem on our situation.  That she\u2019s not an alcoholic or abusive.  Which is true, but it\u2019s not really about her being abusive, it\u2019s that being around drunk people drudges up a lot of painful memories for me.  She just brushed that off though.  \n\nAfter this last time it happened she\u2019s outright fighting me on the issue.   She says this is her home too and we\u2019re both adults.   That I need to get therapy instead of trying to control her.  We had a clear agreement before we moved in though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author has a history of an abusive alcoholic mother, which makes them uncomfortable around alcohol and drunk people. They discussed this with their girlfriend before moving in and made an agreement that she wouldn't drink around them. Initially, she respected that, but lately, she's been coming home drunk and lying about it. The author has tried talking to her, but she dismisses their feelings and accuses them of projecting their past onto her. The author now feels like she's violating the agreement and the situation is deteriorating.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's valid emotional reasons for not wanting to be around alcohol, the prior agreement, and the girlfriend breaking that agreement. The author is trying to communicate their boundaries, which should be respected in a healthy relationship. The girlfriend's response is defensive and dismissive, not taking the author's feelings into account. \n\nBut wait, does the author have the right to impose their personal boundaries on the girlfriend? The author did discuss it with her beforehand, so she agreed to the terms. Moving in with someone often involves setting mutual boundaries. If the author made it clear and the girlfriend agreed, then she's the one not following through. The author isn't trying to control her, they're trying to maintain their mental health and comfort. The girlfriend's argument that the author should get therapy is a bit of a red herring; the author's past is part of their reason, but the issue is about respecting the agreed-upon boundaries. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend is an adult and might feel her autonomy is being restricted. However, since they had an agreement, breaking it could be seen as the issue. The author isn't wrong for setting boundaries based on their trauma. So the answer is probably B, the author isn't in the wrong. The girlfriend is the one violating the agreement and not respecting the author's needs.\n"
