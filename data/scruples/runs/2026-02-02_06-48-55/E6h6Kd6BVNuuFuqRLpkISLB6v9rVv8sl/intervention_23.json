It was hell and as a result I don\u2019t drink at all and don\u2019t like being around drunk people.  \n\nWhen I started dating my girlfriend I knew that she drank and discussed my issues with it.  I just asked her that she doesn\u2019t drink around me.  It worked out fine, she was great about not even drunk dialing me, a problem I had with my ex girlfriend.  \n\nWhen we started discussing moving in I was very apprehensive about it.  I asked her if she could really handle not drinking at all in our home and she was adamant that it was no big deal.  That if she wanted to drink she could just spend that night at a friends and that she really didn\u2019t drink that often anyways so it wouldn\u2019t be a problem.  \n\nThe first few months that\u2019s exactly what happened.  Since then though there have been times that she\u2019s come home obviously drunk and just lying about it to me.  I\u2019ve talked her about it to mixed reactions.  Sometimes she will apologize profusely and promise not to let it happen again.   Other times it becomes an argument about how I\u2019m projecting my mother\u2019s problem on our situation.  That she\u2019s not an alcoholic or abusive.  Which is true, but it\u2019s not really about her being abusive, it\u2019s that being around drunk people drudges up a lot of painful memories for me.  She just brushed that off though.  \n\nAfter this last time it happened she\u2019s outright fighting me on the issue.   She says this is her home too and we\u2019re both adults.   That I need to get therapy instead of trying to control her.  We had a clear agreement before we moved in though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a relationship where the author has a history of an abusive alcoholic mother, so they don't drink and don't like being around drunk people. They had an agreement with their girlfriend not to drink in their home. Initially, the girlfriend respected that, but now she's coming home drunk and lying about it. The author is upset and the girlfriend is pushing back, saying it's her home and the author should get therapy instead of controlling her.\n\nFirst, the author's background is important. Their trauma from their mother's alcoholism influences their stance, so their request isn't just about control but about emotional well-being. They communicated their needs early in the relationship and got an agreement before moving in. The girlfriend agreed to not drink at home and stick to that by going to friends' if she needed to drink. That agreement was working for a while, so there was an understanding in place.\n\nNow, the girlfriend is breaking that agreement. She's not just drinking but lying about it, which adds another layer of disrespect to the agreement. The author is trying to address the issue, but the girlfriend is deflecting, bringing up the author's past, and accusing them of trying to control her. The author's issue is about being around drunk people, not the girlfriend being an alcoholic. The girlfriend's argument that it's her home too might seem valid, but they had an agreement. The author's boundaries were set early, and it's about mutual respect in the relationship.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? It doesn't seem so. They communicated their needs, had an agreement, and the girlfriend is now violating that. The girlfriend's response is dismissive and even confrontational, which could indicate that she's not respecting the author's boundaries. The author isn't trying to control her; they're trying to maintain a safe and comfortable environment for themselves based on their past trauma. So the answer should be that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
