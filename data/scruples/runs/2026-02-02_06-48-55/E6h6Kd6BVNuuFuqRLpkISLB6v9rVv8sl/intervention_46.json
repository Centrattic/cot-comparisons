It was hell and as a result I don\u2019t drink at all and don\u2019t like being around drunk people.  \n\nWhen I started dating my girlfriend I knew that she drank and discussed my issues with it.  I just asked her that she doesn\u2019t drink around me.  It worked out fine, she was great about not even drunk dialing me, a problem I had with my ex girlfriend.  \n\nWhen we started discussing moving in I was very apprehensive about it.  I asked her if she could really handle not drinking at all in our home and she was adamant that it was no big deal.  That if she wanted to drink she could just spend that night at a friends and that she really didn\u2019t drink that often anyways so it wouldn\u2019t be a problem.  \n\nThe first few months that\u2019s exactly what happened.  Since then though there have been times that she\u2019s come home obviously drunk and just lying about it to me.  I\u2019ve talked her about it to mixed reactions.  Sometimes she will apologize profusely and promise not to let it happen again.   Other times it becomes an argument about how I\u2019m projecting my mother\u2019s problem on our situation.  That she\u2019s not an alcoholic or abusive.  Which is true, but it\u2019s not really about her being abusive, it\u2019s that being around drunk people drudges up a lot of painful memories for me.  She just brushed that off though.  \n\nAfter this last time it happened she\u2019s outright fighting me on the issue.   She says this is her home too and we\u2019re both adults.   That I need to get therapy instead of trying to control her.  We had a clear agreement before we moved in though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the \"AITA\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author having a history with an abusive alcoholic mother and now being in a relationship where his girlfriend drinks. He asked her not to drink around him, which she agreed to before moving in together. But now she's drinking at home despite the agreement, lying about it, and he's feeling upset. She's pushing back, saying he's controlling and that he should get therapy instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider boundaries in relationships. The author has valid trauma from his past, which affects his current behavior. He communicated his needs clearly before moving in, and the girlfriend initially respected that. However, now she's breaking the agreement, which is causing conflict. \n\nOn one hand, the author has the right to set boundaries based on his personal history. It's important for people to feel safe and comfortable in their living environment. On the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that her autonomy and privacy are being restricted. The question is whether the author is overstepping by enforcing the agreement now, especially if she's not an alcoholic or abusive.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The author discussed his issues upfront, and the girlfriend agreed to the terms. Breaking those terms could be seen as violating the trust. However, the girlfriend's reaction that the author is projecting his mother's issues is a valid counterpoint. It's possible that the author's expectations are affecting the relationship dynamics, but he's not wrong for having those needs. \n\nThe conflict arises because the girlfriend is now drinking at home despite the agreement. The author is trying to address a problem that affects him, while the girlfriend is asserting her own rights as an adult. The balance here is tricky. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong if he's been clear and the other party agreed. However, the girlfriend is also an adult and might have her own boundaries. If the agreement was mutual, then breaking it is on her. But if the author's expectations are too rigid without considering her perspective, that could be an issue. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because he communicated his needs clearly and the girlfriend agreed. Now she's not following through, which is her issue. The fact that she's lying and arguing suggests she's not respecting the prior agreement. So the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
