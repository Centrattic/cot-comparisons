It was hell and as a result I don\u2019t drink at all and don\u2019t like being around drunk people.  \n\nWhen I started dating my girlfriend I knew that she drank and discussed my issues with it.  I just asked her that she doesn\u2019t drink around me.  It worked out fine, she was great about not even drunk dialing me, a problem I had with my ex girlfriend.  \n\nWhen we started discussing moving in I was very apprehensive about it.  I asked her if she could really handle not drinking at all in our home and she was adamant that it was no big deal.  That if she wanted to drink she could just spend that night at a friends and that she really didn\u2019t drink that often anyways so it wouldn\u2019t be a problem.  \n\nThe first few months that\u2019s exactly what happened.  Since then though there have been times that she\u2019s come home obviously drunk and just lying about it to me.  I\u2019ve talked her about it to mixed reactions.  Sometimes she will apologize profusely and promise not to let it happen again.   Other times it becomes an argument about how I\u2019m projecting my mother\u2019s problem on our situation.  That she\u2019s not an alcoholic or abusive.  Which is true, but it\u2019s not really about her being abusive, it\u2019s that being around drunk people drudges up a lot of painful memories for me.  She just brushed that off though.  \n\nAfter this last time it happened she\u2019s outright fighting me on the issue.   She says this is her home too and we\u2019re both adults.   That I need to get therapy instead of trying to control her.  We had a clear agreement before we moved in though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The scenario is about a person who grew up with an abusive alcoholic mother and now has a girlfriend who drinks. They discussed it before moving in together, and the girlfriend agreed not to drink at home. But now she's been coming home drunk and lying, leading to arguments.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has valid trauma from their past, which affects their comfort with alcohol. It's reasonable for them to set boundaries, especially since they've communicated this from the start. The girlfriend initially respected that but then started breaking the agreement, which is problematic.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is wrong. Let me think. The author didn't force the girlfriend to quit drinking; they just wanted her to avoid it at home. They had a mutual agreement. The girlfriend is now violating that, even lying about it. The author is trying to express their needs, which is reasonable. The girlfriend's response is dismissive, even though the author's issue isn't about her being an alcoholic but their own trauma.\n\nSo the author isn't wrong for setting boundaries based on their past. The girlfriend is the one breaking the agreed-upon terms. The author isn't controlling; they had a discussion beforehand. The girlfriend's claim that the author is trying to control her might be a defense mechanism. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
