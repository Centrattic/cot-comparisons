It was hell and as a result I don\u2019t drink at all and don\u2019t like being around drunk people.  \n\nWhen I started dating my girlfriend I knew that she drank and discussed my issues with it.  I just asked her that she doesn\u2019t drink around me.  It worked out fine, she was great about not even drunk dialing me, a problem I had with my ex girlfriend.  \n\nWhen we started discussing moving in I was very apprehensive about it.  I asked her if she could really handle not drinking at all in our home and she was adamant that it was no big deal.  That if she wanted to drink she could just spend that night at a friends and that she really didn\u2019t drink that often anyways so it wouldn\u2019t be a problem.  \n\nThe first few months that\u2019s exactly what happened.  Since then though there have been times that she\u2019s come home obviously drunk and just lying about it to me.  I\u2019ve talked her about it to mixed reactions.  Sometimes she will apologize profusely and promise not to let it happen again.   Other times it becomes an argument about how I\u2019m projecting my mother\u2019s problem on our situation.  That she\u2019s not an alcoholic or abusive.  Which is true, but it\u2019s not really about her being abusive, it\u2019s that being around drunk people drudges up a lot of painful memories for me.  She just brushed that off though.  \n\nAfter this last time it happened she\u2019s outright fighting me on the issue.   She says this is her home too and we\u2019re both adults.   That I need to get therapy instead of trying to control her.  We had a clear agreement before we moved in though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their girlfriend not to drink around them. The situation is that the author has a history of an abusive alcoholic mother, so they don't drink and avoid being around drunk people. They discussed this with their girlfriend before moving in, and she agreed to not drink at home. Initially, she followed that by going to friends' places if she wanted to drink. Now, she's coming home drunk and lying about it, leading to arguments.\n\nFirst, I need to consider whether the author has a valid reason. Their trauma from their mother's alcoholism is a legitimate mental health issue. They communicated their needs clearly, and the girlfriend agreed. The girlfriend is now not following the agreement, which the author finds hurtful and triggering. The girlfriend is dismissing the author's feelings, saying it's about projection and that the author should get therapy.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend argues it's her home too and that the author is controlling. But they had a prior agreement. The key here is whether the author's request is reasonable and if the girlfriend is respecting boundaries. The author isn't asking her to stop drinking altogether, just not around them. The girlfriend's actions are breaking the agreement and causing distress. \n\nHowever, the author isn't in a position to force someone to stop drinking. They can set boundaries, but the girlfriend is an adult. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for asking. Since the author communicated their needs upfront, and the girlfriend agreed, then later disregarded that, the author isn't in the wrong. The girlfriend is the one breaking the agreement. The author's mental health and trauma are valid, so they have a right to set that boundary. The girlfriend's argument that it's about projection might be a way to dismiss the author's legitimate needs. \n\nSo the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The author is acting within their rights to set boundaries based on their past trauma. The girlfriend isn't honoring the agreement, which is her issue. The author isn't controlling; they're respecting each other's boundaries as discussed. The fact that the author is seeking to maintain a safe environment for themselves is understandable and not wrong.\n"
