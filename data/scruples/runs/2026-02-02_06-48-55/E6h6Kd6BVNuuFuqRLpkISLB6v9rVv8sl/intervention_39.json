It was hell and as a result I don\u2019t drink at all and don\u2019t like being around drunk people.  \n\nWhen I started dating my girlfriend I knew that she drank and discussed my issues with it.  I just asked her that she doesn\u2019t drink around me.  It worked out fine, she was great about not even drunk dialing me, a problem I had with my ex girlfriend.  \n\nWhen we started discussing moving in I was very apprehensive about it.  I asked her if she could really handle not drinking at all in our home and she was adamant that it was no big deal.  That if she wanted to drink she could just spend that night at a friends and that she really didn\u2019t drink that often anyways so it wouldn\u2019t be a problem.  \n\nThe first few months that\u2019s exactly what happened.  Since then though there have been times that she\u2019s come home obviously drunk and just lying about it to me.  I\u2019ve talked her about it to mixed reactions.  Sometimes she will apologize profusely and promise not to let it happen again.   Other times it becomes an argument about how I\u2019m projecting my mother\u2019s problem on our situation.  That she\u2019s not an alcoholic or abusive.  Which is true, but it\u2019s not really about her being abusive, it\u2019s that being around drunk people drudges up a lot of painful memories for me.  She just brushed that off though.  \n\nAfter this last time it happened she\u2019s outright fighting me on the issue.   She says this is her home too and we\u2019re both adults.   That I need to get therapy instead of trying to control her.  We had a clear agreement before we moved in though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves their girlfriend drinking despite an agreement not to, causing emotional distress due to the author's past with an abusive alcoholic mother.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author has a history of trauma with an alcoholic parent, which is a valid reason for their discomfort. They communicated their boundaries early in the relationship, and initially, the girlfriend respected that by not drinking around them. However, after moving in together, the girlfriend started coming home drunk and lying about it. The author confronts her, but she dismisses the issue, comparing it to her past and even suggesting the author needs therapy instead of addressing the problem.\n\nNow, considering boundary issues in relationships. The author set clear boundaries before moving in, which the girlfriend agreed to. Breaking those boundaries, especially when it's causing emotional harm, might be a red flag. The girlfriend's actions (drinking and lying) are violating that agreement, which the author has a right to be upset about, given their trauma.\n\nBut then there's the aspect of mutual respect and communication. The author is trying to address the issue, but the girlfriend is defensive and dismissive, even accusing the author of trying to control her. This could indicate a lack of empathy from the girlfriend. However, the author's approach might be seen as restrictive if their boundaries are too inflexible, but considering their trauma, it's more about their emotional well-being.\n\nAnother angle: the girlfriend's response. She says it's her home too and implies the author is overstepping. But the initial agreement was part of their mutual decision to move in together. If they both agreed to the terms, then the girlfriend is technically violating the agreement by drinking. The author isn't necessarily controlling if they had a prior agreement.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend might have legitimate feelings about their autonomy as an adult. But when boundaries are set and agreed upon, both parties are responsible for respecting them. The author's trauma is a valid reason for those boundaries. The girlfriend's reaction suggests she might not be taking the author's feelings seriously, which could be problematic.\n\nThe author's request isn't to ban drinking entirely but to avoid being around drunk people. The girlfriend's solution to drink elsewhere is a valid compromise, but if she's coming home drunk and lying, it's a breach of trust. The author has every right to be upset and to seek resolution.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but that might be because they perceive the author as being too strict. However, given the trauma context, the author's needs are legitimate. The girlfriend isn't respecting the agreed-upon boundaries, which is a bigger issue. The author isn't the one violating the agreement here.\n\nIn summary, the author is not in the wrong. They have valid reasons for their boundaries and communicated them clearly. The girlfriend is the one not respecting those boundaries and becoming defensive. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
