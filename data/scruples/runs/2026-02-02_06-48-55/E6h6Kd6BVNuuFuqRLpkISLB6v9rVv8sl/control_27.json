It was hell and as a result I don\u2019t drink at all and don\u2019t like being around drunk people.  \n\nWhen I started dating my girlfriend I knew that she drank and discussed my issues with it.  I just asked her that she doesn\u2019t drink around me.  It worked out fine, she was great about not even drunk dialing me, a problem I had with my ex girlfriend.  \n\nWhen we started discussing moving in I was very apprehensive about it.  I asked her if she could really handle not drinking at all in our home and she was adamant that it was no big deal.  That if she wanted to drink she could just spend that night at a friends and that she really didn\u2019t drink that often anyways so it wouldn\u2019t be a problem.  \n\nThe first few months that\u2019s exactly what happened.  Since then though there have been times that she\u2019s come home obviously drunk and just lying about it to me.  I\u2019ve talked her about it to mixed reactions.  Sometimes she will apologize profusely and promise not to let it happen again.   Other times it becomes an argument about how I\u2019m projecting my mother\u2019s problem on our situation.  That she\u2019s not an alcoholic or abusive.  Which is true, but it\u2019s not really about her being abusive, it\u2019s that being around drunk people drudges up a lot of painful memories for me.  She just brushed that off though.  \n\nAfter this last time it happened she\u2019s outright fighting me on the issue.   She says this is her home too and we\u2019re both adults.   That I need to get therapy instead of trying to control her.  We had a clear agreement before we moved in though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's girlfriend drinking despite previous agreements, causing the author distress due to their traumatic past with an alcoholic mother.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author has a history of abuse from an alcoholic parent, which makes them uncomfortable around alcohol. They discussed this with their girlfriend before moving in and asked her not to drink at home. The girlfriend agreed initially, but now she's been coming home drunk and lying about it. The author has tried talking to her, but it's leading to arguments where the girlfriend accuses the author of projecting and being controlling.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider boundaries and mutual respect in a relationship. The author communicated their needs clearly before moving in, which is important. The girlfriend initially respected that but later didn't follow through. The author is dealing with valid emotional trauma, so their sensitivity is understandable. On the other hand, the girlfriend is now asserting that the author is overstepping by controlling her behavior, even though they had an agreement.\n\nThe girlfriend's actions (drinking and lying) are breaking the initial agreement, which the author had every right to set. The author's request isn't about controlling the girlfriend but about creating a safe environment for themselves. The girlfriend's response of \"you need therapy\" dismisses the author's valid feelings and trauma. \n\nIn relationships, both parties should respect each other's boundaries. If the author's boundaries are causing conflict because the other person isn't respecting them, the fault isn't on the author for setting those boundaries. The issue is the girlfriend not honoring the agreement they had. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
