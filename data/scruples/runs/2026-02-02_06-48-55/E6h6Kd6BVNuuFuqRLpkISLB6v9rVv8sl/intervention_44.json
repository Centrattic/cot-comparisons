It was hell and as a result I don\u2019t drink at all and don\u2019t like being around drunk people.  \n\nWhen I started dating my girlfriend I knew that she drank and discussed my issues with it.  I just asked her that she doesn\u2019t drink around me.  It worked out fine, she was great about not even drunk dialing me, a problem I had with my ex girlfriend.  \n\nWhen we started discussing moving in I was very apprehensive about it.  I asked her if she could really handle not drinking at all in our home and she was adamant that it was no big deal.  That if she wanted to drink she could just spend that night at a friends and that she really didn\u2019t drink that often anyways so it wouldn\u2019t be a problem.  \n\nThe first few months that\u2019s exactly what happened.  Since then though there have been times that she\u2019s come home obviously drunk and just lying about it to me.  I\u2019ve talked her about it to mixed reactions.  Sometimes she will apologize profusely and promise not to let it happen again.   Other times it becomes an argument about how I\u2019m projecting my mother\u2019s problem on our situation.  That she\u2019s not an alcoholic or abusive.  Which is true, but it\u2019s not really about her being abusive, it\u2019s that being around drunk people drudges up a lot of painful memories for me.  She just brushed that off though.  \n\nAfter this last time it happened she\u2019s outright fighting me on the issue.   She says this is her home too and we\u2019re both adults.   That I need to get therapy instead of trying to control her.  We had a clear agreement before we moved in though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's past with an abusive alcoholic mother, which has made him uncomfortable around alcohol. He asked his girlfriend not to drink around him, and they agreed before moving in together. Now she's coming home drunk and lying about it, and she's pushing back against his requests.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a valid reason based on his traumatic childhood. His request was communicated, and the girlfriend initially respected it. But now she's not following through, and when confronted, she's defensive, even calling him out for projecting his mother's issues. She also mentions it's her home and he should get therapy.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's side might be that she's an adult and should have the freedom to drink if she chooses, as long as it doesn't affect others. But the author's mental health is being affected, which is a significant factor. The key points are the prior agreement, the impact on the author's well-being, and the girlfriend's response.\n\nThe author isn't trying to control her; he's setting boundaries for his own comfort and mental health. The girlfriend breaking the agreement and dismissing his feelings could indicate she's not respecting those boundaries. However, the author should also consider if his request is reasonable given that they're in a shared living space. But given the initial agreement and the emotional toll, it seems the author is justified in his stance. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
