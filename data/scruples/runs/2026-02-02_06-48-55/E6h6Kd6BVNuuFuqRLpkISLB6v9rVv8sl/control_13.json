It was hell and as a result I don\u2019t drink at all and don\u2019t like being around drunk people.  \n\nWhen I started dating my girlfriend I knew that she drank and discussed my issues with it.  I just asked her that she doesn\u2019t drink around me.  It worked out fine, she was great about not even drunk dialing me, a problem I had with my ex girlfriend.  \n\nWhen we started discussing moving in I was very apprehensive about it.  I asked her if she could really handle not drinking at all in our home and she was adamant that it was no big deal.  That if she wanted to drink she could just spend that night at a friends and that she really didn\u2019t drink that often anyways so it wouldn\u2019t be a problem.  \n\nThe first few months that\u2019s exactly what happened.  Since then though there have been times that she\u2019s come home obviously drunk and just lying about it to me.  I\u2019ve talked her about it to mixed reactions.  Sometimes she will apologize profusely and promise not to let it happen again.   Other times it becomes an argument about how I\u2019m projecting my mother\u2019s problem on our situation.  That she\u2019s not an alcoholic or abusive.  Which is true, but it\u2019s not really about her being abusive, it\u2019s that being around drunk people drudges up a lot of painful memories for me.  She just brushed that off though.  \n\nAfter this last time it happened she\u2019s outright fighting me on the issue.   She says this is her home too and we\u2019re both adults.   That I need to get therapy instead of trying to control her.  We had a clear agreement before we moved in though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for asking their girlfriend not to drink around them. Let's break down the details.\n\nFirst, the author has a history of an abusive alcoholic mother, which makes them uncomfortable around drinking. They communicated this to their girlfriend early on, and she agreed to avoid drinking around them, which worked for a while. When moving in together, they discussed and she agreed that she wouldn't drink at home. However, later she started coming home drunk and lying about it. The author confronts her, but she dismisses their concerns, saying it's about projection and that they should get therapy instead.\n\nSo, the key points are communication and boundaries. The author set clear boundaries based on their trauma. The girlfriend initially respected them but later broke them. The author is trying to enforce their agreed-upon terms, which she's now resisting. The girlfriend is not an alcoholic but her actions are causing distress. The author's main issue isn't her drinking per se, but being around drunk people triggers their past trauma.\n\nIs the author wrong? They didn't force her to stop drinking entirely, just in their home. They had a mutual agreement. She's breaking that agreement now. The author is trying to protect their mental health. The girlfriend's response is to accuse the author of controlling behavior, but the author is upholding their own needs. So, probably the author isn't in the wrong here. The issue is about respecting boundaries and the girlfriend not honoring the agreement she made. The author's actions are about their own well-being, which is valid. So answer B, No.\n"
