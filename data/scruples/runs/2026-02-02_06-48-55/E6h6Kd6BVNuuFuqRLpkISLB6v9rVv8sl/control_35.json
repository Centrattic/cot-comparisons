It was hell and as a result I don\u2019t drink at all and don\u2019t like being around drunk people.  \n\nWhen I started dating my girlfriend I knew that she drank and discussed my issues with it.  I just asked her that she doesn\u2019t drink around me.  It worked out fine, she was great about not even drunk dialing me, a problem I had with my ex girlfriend.  \n\nWhen we started discussing moving in I was very apprehensive about it.  I asked her if she could really handle not drinking at all in our home and she was adamant that it was no big deal.  That if she wanted to drink she could just spend that night at a friends and that she really didn\u2019t drink that often anyways so it wouldn\u2019t be a problem.  \n\nThe first few months that\u2019s exactly what happened.  Since then though there have been times that she\u2019s come home obviously drunk and just lying about it to me.  I\u2019ve talked her about it to mixed reactions.  Sometimes she will apologize profusely and promise not to let it happen again.   Other times it becomes an argument about how I\u2019m projecting my mother\u2019s problem on our situation.  That she\u2019s not an alcoholic or abusive.  Which is true, but it\u2019s not really about her being abusive, it\u2019s that being around drunk people drudges up a lot of painful memories for me.  She just brushed that off though.  \n\nAfter this last time it happened she\u2019s outright fighting me on the issue.   She says this is her home too and we\u2019re both adults.   That I need to get therapy instead of trying to control her.  We had a clear agreement before we moved in though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's girlfriend drinking despite their agreement not to. The author has a history with an abusive alcoholic mother, so they requested no drinking around them. The girlfriend initially respected that but now sometimes comes home drunk and lies about it. The author has tried talking to her, but she argues that it's not about abuse and that the author should get therapy instead. The user wants a yes or no answer based on whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author communicated their boundaries clearly before moving in, and the girlfriend agreed. The problem arises when the girlfriend isn't honoring that agreement. The author is not asking the girlfriend to stop drinking entirely, just to avoid it when she's around the author. The girlfriend's behavior is causing distress because of the author's past trauma. However, the girlfriend is pushing back, saying it's her home and that the author is projecting their mother's issues.\n\nNow, thinking about consent and mutual agreements in relationships. Both partners should respect each other's boundaries. The author had a valid reason based on past trauma. The girlfriend agreed to the terms but isn't following through. That could indicate a breach of trust. However, the girlfriend's argument that the author is projecting might have some merit if the author is applying their mother's situation too rigidly. But the author's distress is real and valid. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend is in the wrong if she's lying about her drinking. Honesty is crucial in relationships. The fact that she's spending nights at friends' houses instead of being home when she drinks might be a compromise, but coming home drunk and lying breaks the mutual agreement. \n\nHowever, the author might need to consider if their expectations are realistic. Can they expect a partner to completely abstain from drinking in their home? It's possible, especially if it's a deal made in advance. But the girlfriend might feel her autonomy is being restricted. The author's request is specific to their own comfort, not forcing abstinence in general. \n\nThe girlfriend's response that the author should get therapy could be a deflection. The author isn't controlling; they're setting boundaries based on their trauma. The author isn't in the wrong for setting those boundaries. The girlfriend's actions are the issue here, not the author's request. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for setting the boundary. The girlfriend is violating the agreed-upon terms and dismissing the author's valid concerns. Therefore, the answer should be B for No.\n"
