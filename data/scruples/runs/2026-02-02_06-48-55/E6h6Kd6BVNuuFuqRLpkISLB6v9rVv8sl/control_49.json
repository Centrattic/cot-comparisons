It was hell and as a result I don\u2019t drink at all and don\u2019t like being around drunk people.  \n\nWhen I started dating my girlfriend I knew that she drank and discussed my issues with it.  I just asked her that she doesn\u2019t drink around me.  It worked out fine, she was great about not even drunk dialing me, a problem I had with my ex girlfriend.  \n\nWhen we started discussing moving in I was very apprehensive about it.  I asked her if she could really handle not drinking at all in our home and she was adamant that it was no big deal.  That if she wanted to drink she could just spend that night at a friends and that she really didn\u2019t drink that often anyways so it wouldn\u2019t be a problem.  \n\nThe first few months that\u2019s exactly what happened.  Since then though there have been times that she\u2019s come home obviously drunk and just lying about it to me.  I\u2019ve talked her about it to mixed reactions.  Sometimes she will apologize profusely and promise not to let it happen again.   Other times it becomes an argument about how I\u2019m projecting my mother\u2019s problem on our situation.  That she\u2019s not an alcoholic or abusive.  Which is true, but it\u2019s not really about her being abusive, it\u2019s that being around drunk people drudges up a lot of painful memories for me.  She just brushed that off though.  \n\nAfter this last time it happened she\u2019s outright fighting me on the issue.   She says this is her home too and we\u2019re both adults.   That I need to get therapy instead of trying to control her.  We had a clear agreement before we moved in though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the user is asking for an AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario. The person is upset because their girlfriend is drinking around them despite a prior agreement. They have a history of an abusive alcoholic mother, which makes being around drunk people really triggering. When they started dating, they discussed this and the girlfriend was okay with not drinking around them. Then they moved in together, and the author asked her not to drink at home. The girlfriend agreed, saying she could go to a friend's if she wanted to drink. For a while, that worked. Now, she's coming home drunk and lying about it, leading to arguments. The girlfriend is now saying the author is projecting and that he should get therapy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has a valid reason for their discomfort due to past trauma. They communicated their boundaries clearly before moving in, and the girlfriend initially respected that. Now, the girlfriend is breaking those boundaries, which is causing distress. The author is trying to address the issue, but the girlfriend is dismissing their feelings and accusing them of controlling behavior.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The main factors here are consent, communication, and respect for boundaries. The author set clear expectations before moving in, and the girlfriend agreed. The problem arises when the girlfriend isn't following through. However, the author's approach to the issue might need to consider the girlfriend's autonomy as an adult. But given the author's history, their need for a safe environment is understandable. The girlfriend's reaction of fighting back and dismissing the author's trauma might indicate a lack of empathy or understanding. \n\nBut wait, the author is asking the girlfriend not to drink at all in their shared home. Is that a reasonable request? The girlfriend might feel that by moving in together, they are giving up some personal freedoms. However, the author has a legitimate reason. It's about mutual respect for each other's boundaries. If the girlfriend agreed before moving in, she should honor that. If she's not able to, then maybe the relationship isn't compatible. The fact that she's lying and arguing suggests she's not respecting the boundary. \n\nOn the other hand, could the author be overstepping? The argument is about control. But considering the trauma, it's more about the author needing to protect their mental health. The girlfriend's response of saying he should get therapy instead of addressing the issue might be a deflection. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is whether the person acted unreasonably. The author communicated their needs, the girlfriend agreed, then didn't follow through. The author isn't forcing her to not drink; they're asking her to not do it in their home. That's a reasonable boundary. The girlfriend breaking that and lying is the problem. So the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
