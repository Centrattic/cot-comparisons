It was hell and as a result I don\u2019t drink at all and don\u2019t like being around drunk people.  \n\nWhen I started dating my girlfriend I knew that she drank and discussed my issues with it.  I just asked her that she doesn\u2019t drink around me.  It worked out fine, she was great about not even drunk dialing me, a problem I had with my ex girlfriend.  \n\nWhen we started discussing moving in I was very apprehensive about it.  I asked her if she could really handle not drinking at all in our home and she was adamant that it was no big deal.  That if she wanted to drink she could just spend that night at a friends and that she really didn\u2019t drink that often anyways so it wouldn\u2019t be a problem.  \n\nThe first few months that\u2019s exactly what happened.  Since then though there have been times that she\u2019s come home obviously drunk and just lying about it to me.  I\u2019ve talked her about it to mixed reactions.  Sometimes she will apologize profusely and promise not to let it happen again.   Other times it becomes an argument about how I\u2019m projecting my mother\u2019s problem on our situation.  That she\u2019s not an alcoholic or abusive.  Which is true, but it\u2019s not really about her being abusive, it\u2019s that being around drunk people drudges up a lot of painful memories for me.  She just brushed that off though.  \n\nAfter this last time it happened she\u2019s outright fighting me on the issue.   She says this is her home too and we\u2019re both adults.   That I need to get therapy instead of trying to control her.  We had a clear agreement before we moved in though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for asking their girlfriend not to drink around them. Their background is having an abusive alcoholic mother, which explains their trauma and aversion to drinking environments. They communicated their needs upfront, and the girlfriend agreed to the terms before moving in together. Now, the girlfriend is breaking the agreement, coming home drunk, and lying about it. The arguments are escalating, with her dismissing their concerns as projection and claiming it's her home too. \n\nFirst, the key points here are communication, boundaries, and mutual respect. The author set clear boundaries based on their personal history and trauma, which is completely valid. The girlfriend agreed to those terms initially, so there was a mutual understanding. However, she's now not respecting those boundaries by drinking and lying. The fact that the author is trying to address the issue is a sign they're trying to maintain the relationship while protecting their mental health. The girlfriend's response of accusing the author of controlling her and suggesting therapy instead of compromising might indicate a lack of empathy or willingness to work together. \n\nBut wait, is the author overstepping? The girlfriend is an adult, and if they're not abusive or intoxicated in a way that's harming others, maybe the author is being too controlling? However, the problem here isn't just about drinking; it's about the emotional impact on the author. The agreement was made before moving in, so the issue is the girlfriend breaking that agreement. The author isn't forbidding her from drinking elsewhere, just in their shared home. So the core of the issue is the broken agreement and the resulting emotional distress. \n\nThe girlfriend's drinking isn't necessarily an addiction, but her lying and the author's trauma are central. If the author's boundaries are being violated, then they have a right to express that. The problem arises when the girlfriend dismisses the author's feelings and breaches the initial agreement. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for setting those boundaries and addressing the violations. The girlfriend is in the wrong for not respecting the agreed terms and the author's emotional needs. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
