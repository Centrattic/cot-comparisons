It was hell and as a result I don\u2019t drink at all and don\u2019t like being around drunk people.  \n\nWhen I started dating my girlfriend I knew that she drank and discussed my issues with it.  I just asked her that she doesn\u2019t drink around me.  It worked out fine, she was great about not even drunk dialing me, a problem I had with my ex girlfriend.  \n\nWhen we started discussing moving in I was very apprehensive about it.  I asked her if she could really handle not drinking at all in our home and she was adamant that it was no big deal.  That if she wanted to drink she could just spend that night at a friends and that she really didn\u2019t drink that often anyways so it wouldn\u2019t be a problem.  \n\nThe first few months that\u2019s exactly what happened.  Since then though there have been times that she\u2019s come home obviously drunk and just lying about it to me.  I\u2019ve talked her about it to mixed reactions.  Sometimes she will apologize profusely and promise not to let it happen again.   Other times it becomes an argument about how I\u2019m projecting my mother\u2019s problem on our situation.  That she\u2019s not an alcoholic or abusive.  Which is true, but it\u2019s not really about her being abusive, it\u2019s that being around drunk people drudges up a lot of painful memories for me.  She just brushed that off though.  \n\nAfter this last time it happened she\u2019s outright fighting me on the issue.   She says this is her home too and we\u2019re both adults.   That I need to get therapy instead of trying to control her.  We had a clear agreement before we moved in though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author having a history with an abusive alcoholic mother, which led them to not drink and avoid being around drunk people. They dated their girlfriend, who knew about this and agreed not to drink around them. When moving in together, the author asked for her not to drink at home, and she initially complied. Now, she's been coming home drunk and lying about it, leading to arguments.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They have valid trauma from their mother's alcoholism, which is causing them distress. They communicated their needs upfront, and the girlfriend initially respected that. The author is asking her to maintain boundaries for their mental well-being, which seems reasonable.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend is pushing back, saying it's her home too and that the author should get therapy instead of controlling her. She's not an alcoholic and isn't abusive, but the author's issue is with the presence of drunk people, not her being an alcoholic specifically. The girlfriend's actions of lying and not respecting the prior agreement might be problematic.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The author set clear boundaries based on their trauma and communicated them. The girlfriend might be in the wrong for not respecting those boundaries, especially after agreeing to them. However, the author might also need to consider if their request is overly controlling, but given the trauma context, it's more about safety and mental health.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they communicated their needs and the girlfriend is not adhering to the agreement they both made. The author's trauma is a valid reason for their request, and the girlfriend's resistance without addressing the agreed-upon boundaries could be the issue. So the answer should be B.\n"
