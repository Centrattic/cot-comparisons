It was hell and as a result I don\u2019t drink at all and don\u2019t like being around drunk people.  \n\nWhen I started dating my girlfriend I knew that she drank and discussed my issues with it.  I just asked her that she doesn\u2019t drink around me.  It worked out fine, she was great about not even drunk dialing me, a problem I had with my ex girlfriend.  \n\nWhen we started discussing moving in I was very apprehensive about it.  I asked her if she could really handle not drinking at all in our home and she was adamant that it was no big deal.  That if she wanted to drink she could just spend that night at a friends and that she really didn\u2019t drink that often anyways so it wouldn\u2019t be a problem.  \n\nThe first few months that\u2019s exactly what happened.  Since then though there have been times that she\u2019s come home obviously drunk and just lying about it to me.  I\u2019ve talked her about it to mixed reactions.  Sometimes she will apologize profusely and promise not to let it happen again.   Other times it becomes an argument about how I\u2019m projecting my mother\u2019s problem on our situation.  That she\u2019s not an alcoholic or abusive.  Which is true, but it\u2019s not really about her being abusive, it\u2019s that being around drunk people drudges up a lot of painful memories for me.  She just brushed that off though.  \n\nAfter this last time it happened she\u2019s outright fighting me on the issue.   She says this is her home too and we\u2019re both adults.   That I need to get therapy instead of trying to control her.  We had a clear agreement before we moved in though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for asking their girlfriend not to drink around them. They have a history of an abusive alcoholic mother, so they don't drink and don't like being around drunk people. They discussed this with their girlfriend before moving in, and she agreed not to drink at home. But now she's been coming home drunk and lying, leading to arguments.\n\nFirst, the author's boundaries are based on trauma. It's valid to set boundaries because of past experiences. They communicated this upfront, which is good. The girlfriend agreed initially but is now breaking that agreement. She's defending her actions by saying it's her home too and that the author needs therapy. \n\nBut the author isn't trying to control her; they had a mutual agreement. The girlfriend's actions are violating that agreement. The author is trying to protect their mental health, which is reasonable. The girlfriend's response seems dismissive of the author's trauma. \n\nHowever, the author's approach might be seen as controlling if they're not allowing any flexibility, but in this context, it's about their personal well-being. The key is that the author communicated their needs and the partner is not respecting that. So the author isn't in the wrong here. The issue lies with the girlfriend not honoring the agreement. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
