It was hell and as a result I don\u2019t drink at all and don\u2019t like being around drunk people.  \n\nWhen I started dating my girlfriend I knew that she drank and discussed my issues with it.  I just asked her that she doesn\u2019t drink around me.  It worked out fine, she was great about not even drunk dialing me, a problem I had with my ex girlfriend.  \n\nWhen we started discussing moving in I was very apprehensive about it.  I asked her if she could really handle not drinking at all in our home and she was adamant that it was no big deal.  That if she wanted to drink she could just spend that night at a friends and that she really didn\u2019t drink that often anyways so it wouldn\u2019t be a problem.  \n\nThe first few months that\u2019s exactly what happened.  Since then though there have been times that she\u2019s come home obviously drunk and just lying about it to me.  I\u2019ve talked her about it to mixed reactions.  Sometimes she will apologize profusely and promise not to let it happen again.   Other times it becomes an argument about how I\u2019m projecting my mother\u2019s problem on our situation.  That she\u2019s not an alcoholic or abusive.  Which is true, but it\u2019s not really about her being abusive, it\u2019s that being around drunk people drudges up a lot of painful memories for me.  She just brushed that off though.  \n\nAfter this last time it happened she\u2019s outright fighting me on the issue.   She says this is her home too and we\u2019re both adults.   That I need to get therapy instead of trying to control her.  We had a clear agreement before we moved in though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking if the person in the \"AITA\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's girlfriend drinking despite their agreement not to, and the resulting conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author has a history of an abusive alcoholic mother, which makes them uncomfortable around alcohol. They discussed this with their girlfriend before moving in, and she agreed not to drink at home. Initially, she followed through by going to friends' places when she wanted to drink. But recently, she's come home drunk and lied about it, leading to arguments. The author is now being accused of trying to control her, even though there was a prior agreement.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. The author clearly communicated their boundaries before moving in. The girlfriend initially respected that agreement. The issue arises when she starts breaking the agreement. The author is trying to address the problem, but the girlfriend is dismissive and even accuses the author of controlling behavior. The author's issue isn't about the girlfriend being an alcoholic but about their own trauma being triggered by being around drunk people.\n\nFrom a boundaries perspective, if both parties agreed to something and one party is breaking that agreement, the person who set the boundary isn't necessarily in the wrong. The girlfriend's actions are violating the mutual agreement, which the author had a valid reason for. The author is trying to maintain their comfort and mental health, which is important. The girlfriend's response of dismissing the author's feelings and suggesting therapy (which the author might actually need, but that's not the main issue here) could indicate a lack of respect for the agreed-upon boundaries.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that adults should be able to make their own choices, even if it's in a shared home. However, the key here is that the agreement was mutual. The author isn't forbidding her from drinking entirely but from doing so in their shared home, respecting the author's trauma. The girlfriend's lying and then dismissing the author's concerns might be where she's at fault, not the author.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries and trying to enforce the agreement they both made. The girlfriend is the one breaking the agreement and not respecting the author's needs. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
