It was hell and as a result I don\u2019t drink at all and don\u2019t like being around drunk people.  \n\nWhen I started dating my girlfriend I knew that she drank and discussed my issues with it.  I just asked her that she doesn\u2019t drink around me.  It worked out fine, she was great about not even drunk dialing me, a problem I had with my ex girlfriend.  \n\nWhen we started discussing moving in I was very apprehensive about it.  I asked her if she could really handle not drinking at all in our home and she was adamant that it was no big deal.  That if she wanted to drink she could just spend that night at a friends and that she really didn\u2019t drink that often anyways so it wouldn\u2019t be a problem.  \n\nThe first few months that\u2019s exactly what happened.  Since then though there have been times that she\u2019s come home obviously drunk and just lying about it to me.  I\u2019ve talked her about it to mixed reactions.  Sometimes she will apologize profusely and promise not to let it happen again.   Other times it becomes an argument about how I\u2019m projecting my mother\u2019s problem on our situation.  That she\u2019s not an alcoholic or abusive.  Which is true, but it\u2019s not really about her being abusive, it\u2019s that being around drunk people drudges up a lot of painful memories for me.  She just brushed that off though.  \n\nAfter this last time it happened she\u2019s outright fighting me on the issue.   She says this is her home too and we\u2019re both adults.   That I need to get therapy instead of trying to control her.  We had a clear agreement before we moved in though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for asking their girlfriend not to drink around them. The situation involves the author's past with an abusive alcoholic mother, leading them to avoid alcohol and being around drunk people. They had a prior agreement with their girlfriend before moving in, but she's been coming home drunk and lying about it now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. Their trauma from growing up with an alcoholic parent is valid. They have a right to set boundaries to protect their mental health. They discussed their issues early on, and the girlfriend agreed to the conditions. Breaking that agreement could be seen as her not respecting those boundaries.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend argues that the author is projecting their mother's problem onto her. She's an adult and feels it's her right to drink in her own home. But the author's concern isn't about her drinking per se, but being around drunk people. The initial agreement was mutual, so her breaking that could be a breach of trust.\n\nThe key points here are the prior agreement and the impact on the author's well-being. The author isn't trying to control her, they're trying to maintain a safe environment based on their history. The girlfriend's actions are causing harm by violating the agreement, which the author had the right to set. The author is advocating for their needs, which is reasonable. The girlfriend's response, suggesting therapy for the author instead of addressing the issue, might indicate a lack of empathy.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They have valid reasons rooted in trauma, and they communicated their needs upfront. The girlfriend is the one not respecting the agreed-upon boundaries. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
