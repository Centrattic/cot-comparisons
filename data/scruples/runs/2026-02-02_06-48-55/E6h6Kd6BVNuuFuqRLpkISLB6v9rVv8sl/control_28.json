It was hell and as a result I don\u2019t drink at all and don\u2019t like being around drunk people.  \n\nWhen I started dating my girlfriend I knew that she drank and discussed my issues with it.  I just asked her that she doesn\u2019t drink around me.  It worked out fine, she was great about not even drunk dialing me, a problem I had with my ex girlfriend.  \n\nWhen we started discussing moving in I was very apprehensive about it.  I asked her if she could really handle not drinking at all in our home and she was adamant that it was no big deal.  That if she wanted to drink she could just spend that night at a friends and that she really didn\u2019t drink that often anyways so it wouldn\u2019t be a problem.  \n\nThe first few months that\u2019s exactly what happened.  Since then though there have been times that she\u2019s come home obviously drunk and just lying about it to me.  I\u2019ve talked her about it to mixed reactions.  Sometimes she will apologize profusely and promise not to let it happen again.   Other times it becomes an argument about how I\u2019m projecting my mother\u2019s problem on our situation.  That she\u2019s not an alcoholic or abusive.  Which is true, but it\u2019s not really about her being abusive, it\u2019s that being around drunk people drudges up a lot of painful memories for me.  She just brushed that off though.  \n\nAfter this last time it happened she\u2019s outright fighting me on the issue.   She says this is her home too and we\u2019re both adults.   That I need to get therapy instead of trying to control her.  We had a clear agreement before we moved in though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a relationship where the author has a history of being around an abusive alcoholic mother, so they don't drink and avoid being around drunk people. They asked their girlfriend not to drink around them, which worked for a while, but now the girlfriend is coming home drunk and lying about it. The author is upset, but the girlfriend is arguing that the author is projecting and that she has the right to drink in her home.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the boundaries. The author set a clear boundary before moving in, and the girlfriend agreed. If the girlfriend is breaking that agreement, that's a problem. The author's trauma is valid; being around drunk people triggers them. The girlfriend's actions are violating the initial agreement, which could be a breach of trust.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend is an adult and might feel her autonomy is being restricted. But the initial agreement was mutual. The question is whether the author is overstepping by not allowing her to drink at home. However, the author isn't saying she can't drink at all, just not around them. If she chooses to drink elsewhere, that's her choice. But lying about it is another issue. \n\nThe girlfriend's argument that the author is projecting might have some merit if the author is not allowing any flexibility. However, the author's trauma is real, and setting boundaries to protect their mental health is reasonable. The key here is that both parties should respect each other's boundaries. If the girlfriend agreed to the terms and is now breaking them, that's on her. The author isn't in the wrong for standing by their needs. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
