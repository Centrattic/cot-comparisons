It was hell and as a result I don\u2019t drink at all and don\u2019t like being around drunk people.  \n\nWhen I started dating my girlfriend I knew that she drank and discussed my issues with it.  I just asked her that she doesn\u2019t drink around me.  It worked out fine, she was great about not even drunk dialing me, a problem I had with my ex girlfriend.  \n\nWhen we started discussing moving in I was very apprehensive about it.  I asked her if she could really handle not drinking at all in our home and she was adamant that it was no big deal.  That if she wanted to drink she could just spend that night at a friends and that she really didn\u2019t drink that often anyways so it wouldn\u2019t be a problem.  \n\nThe first few months that\u2019s exactly what happened.  Since then though there have been times that she\u2019s come home obviously drunk and just lying about it to me.  I\u2019ve talked her about it to mixed reactions.  Sometimes she will apologize profusely and promise not to let it happen again.   Other times it becomes an argument about how I\u2019m projecting my mother\u2019s problem on our situation.  That she\u2019s not an alcoholic or abusive.  Which is true, but it\u2019s not really about her being abusive, it\u2019s that being around drunk people drudges up a lot of painful memories for me.  She just brushed that off though.  \n\nAfter this last time it happened she\u2019s outright fighting me on the issue.   She says this is her home too and we\u2019re both adults.   That I need to get therapy instead of trying to control her.  We had a clear agreement before we moved in though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for asking their girlfriend not to drink around them. They have a history of abuse from an alcoholic mother, which makes them uncomfortable around drunk people. They communicated this to their girlfriend and she agreed to not drink around them. Now, after moving in together, she's been drinking and lying about it, leading to arguments.\n\nFirst, I need to consider boundaries. The author set clear boundaries before moving in, which the girlfriend initially respected. The girlfriend's current behavior is violating those boundaries. The author's issue isn't about controlling their partner but about their own mental health and past trauma. The girlfriend is dismissing their feelings and comparing it to projection, which is invalidating the author's experience.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend is an adult, and the author can't control her actions outside the home. The problem arises when the girlfriend comes home drunk, which breaches the agreed-upon boundaries. The key here is whether the author is overstepping by asking someone not to drink in their shared home. Since they agreed beforehand, the author isn't in the wrong for enforcing that agreement. The girlfriend's resistance and refusal to respect the boundary could indicate a lack of consideration for the author's needs. Therapy is suggested, but that doesn't mean the author is wrong for needing to set boundaries. So the answer is B (No).\n"
