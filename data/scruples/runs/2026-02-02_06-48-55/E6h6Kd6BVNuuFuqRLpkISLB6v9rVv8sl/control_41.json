It was hell and as a result I don\u2019t drink at all and don\u2019t like being around drunk people.  \n\nWhen I started dating my girlfriend I knew that she drank and discussed my issues with it.  I just asked her that she doesn\u2019t drink around me.  It worked out fine, she was great about not even drunk dialing me, a problem I had with my ex girlfriend.  \n\nWhen we started discussing moving in I was very apprehensive about it.  I asked her if she could really handle not drinking at all in our home and she was adamant that it was no big deal.  That if she wanted to drink she could just spend that night at a friends and that she really didn\u2019t drink that often anyways so it wouldn\u2019t be a problem.  \n\nThe first few months that\u2019s exactly what happened.  Since then though there have been times that she\u2019s come home obviously drunk and just lying about it to me.  I\u2019ve talked her about it to mixed reactions.  Sometimes she will apologize profusely and promise not to let it happen again.   Other times it becomes an argument about how I\u2019m projecting my mother\u2019s problem on our situation.  That she\u2019s not an alcoholic or abusive.  Which is true, but it\u2019s not really about her being abusive, it\u2019s that being around drunk people drudges up a lot of painful memories for me.  She just brushed that off though.  \n\nAfter this last time it happened she\u2019s outright fighting me on the issue.   She says this is her home too and we\u2019re both adults.   That I need to get therapy instead of trying to control her.  We had a clear agreement before we moved in though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's issues with his girlfriend drinking.\n\nSo, the author has a history of an abusive alcoholic mother, which makes him uncomfortable around drunk people. He discussed this with his girlfriend before moving in together and they agreed she wouldn't drink around him. Initially, she respected that, but lately, she's come home drunk and lied about it. He's tried talking to her, but she's defensive, saying he's projecting and that she should be allowed to drink in her own home.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. He has valid trauma from his past, and setting boundaries to protect his mental health makes sense. He communicated his needs to her beforehand, and she agreed. So he's not wrong for having those boundaries. The issue is whether it's reasonable to expect her not to drink at all in their home, especially if she's not an alcoholic.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend is an adult, and the author is now asking her to completely abstain from drinking, which might be a significant lifestyle change for her. The argument is about mutual respect and boundaries. The author is asking her to change a behavior to accommodate his trauma, which is a big ask. However, they did agree to this arrangement before moving in, so she might have known what to expect.\n\nBut over time, the situation has changed. The author mentions she's lying about being drunk now, which complicates things. If she's breaching the agreed-upon boundaries, that's a problem. The question is whether the author is in the wrong by enforcing those boundaries or if the girlfriend is overstepping by not respecting them.\n\nThe girlfriend's response that it's her home too and he should get therapy might be dismissive of his genuine feelings. However, the author might also need to consider if his demands are reasonable. If she drinks in private and doesn't affect him, maybe there's a middle ground. But if he can't be around drunk people at all, then her drinking in the home could trigger him. \n\nI think the key points are: 1) The author's trauma is valid, and he has the right to set boundaries. 2) They had an agreement, and if she's not honoring it, that's a breach. 3) However, the author's approach might need to be more flexible if the situation changes. But since she agreed upfront, maybe the problem is her not sticking to the agreement. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries based on his trauma. The girlfriend is wrong for not respecting the agreed terms, but the author's insistence on total abstinence might be unrealistic long-term. However, given their prior agreement, the main issue is her breaking the agreement. The answer is likely B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
