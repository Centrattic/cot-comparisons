It was hell and as a result I don\u2019t drink at all and don\u2019t like being around drunk people.  \n\nWhen I started dating my girlfriend I knew that she drank and discussed my issues with it.  I just asked her that she doesn\u2019t drink around me.  It worked out fine, she was great about not even drunk dialing me, a problem I had with my ex girlfriend.  \n\nWhen we started discussing moving in I was very apprehensive about it.  I asked her if she could really handle not drinking at all in our home and she was adamant that it was no big deal.  That if she wanted to drink she could just spend that night at a friends and that she really didn\u2019t drink that often anyways so it wouldn\u2019t be a problem.  \n\nThe first few months that\u2019s exactly what happened.  Since then though there have been times that she\u2019s come home obviously drunk and just lying about it to me.  I\u2019ve talked her about it to mixed reactions.  Sometimes she will apologize profusely and promise not to let it happen again.   Other times it becomes an argument about how I\u2019m projecting my mother\u2019s problem on our situation.  That she\u2019s not an alcoholic or abusive.  Which is true, but it\u2019s not really about her being abusive, it\u2019s that being around drunk people drudges up a lot of painful memories for me.  She just brushed that off though.  \n\nAfter this last time it happened she\u2019s outright fighting me on the issue.   She says this is her home too and we\u2019re both adults.   That I need to get therapy instead of trying to control her.  We had a clear agreement before we moved in though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author has a history of an abusive, alcoholic mother, which makes them uncomfortable around alcohol. They mentioned they don't drink at all and dislike being around drunk people. When they started dating their girlfriend, they discussed this issue and she agreed not to drink around them. Initially, it worked well\u2014she didn't even drunk dial, unlike the ex. Then they moved in together, and the author asked again if she could handle not drinking at home. She said it wasn't a problem and that she could go to a friend's if she wanted to drink. \n\nHowever, over time, she started coming home drunk and lying about it. The author has brought this up, but there's been mixed reactions from her. Sometimes she apologizes, sometimes she argues that the author is projecting their mother's issues onto her, even though she's not abusive. The author is upset because being around drunk people triggers bad memories, but she dismisses that. Now she's fighting back, saying it's her home too and that the author should get therapy instead of controlling her. The author feels like they had a clear agreement before moving in.\n\nSo the question is, is the author in the wrong here? The options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has valid trauma and set boundaries based on that. They communicated their needs upfront, and the girlfriend initially respected that. But now the girlfriend is breaking that agreement, which is causing conflict. The author's issue isn't about the girlfriend being an alcoholic or abusive but about their own trauma and triggers. The girlfriend is now dismissing the author's feelings and accusing them of control issues.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that her autonomy is being restricted. She's an adult and might feel entitled to drink in her own home. The author is asking her not to drink at home, which could be seen as an unreasonable request if the girlfriend doesn't have the same issues with alcohol. The girlfriend's behavior of lying and coming home drunk is problematic, but the author's approach could be seen as trying to control her actions, even if it's based on trauma.\n\nThe key here is whether the author has the right to set such boundaries. Since they communicated their needs and the girlfriend agreed before moving in, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for asking. However, the girlfriend breaking the agreement is her issue. The author's actions are about their own well-being, but the girlfriend's refusal to respect the agreement and the accusation of controlling behavior could be a problem. \n\nBut the author isn't forbidding her from drinking in general; they just want her to not do it at home. The girlfriend can still drink elsewhere. The author's trauma is a legitimate reason to set this boundary. The girlfriend's argument that it's her home too might not take into account the author's specific needs. The author isn't trying to control her but to protect their mental health. \n\nSo, I think the author is not in the wrong (B). They have a history that makes this a valid concern, and they communicated their needs. The girlfriend is the one not respecting the agreement and dismissing the author's feelings. The author's stance is about their personal boundaries, which are important to their well-being.\n"
