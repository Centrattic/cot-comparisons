It was hell and as a result I don\u2019t drink at all and don\u2019t like being around drunk people.  \n\nWhen I started dating my girlfriend I knew that she drank and discussed my issues with it.  I just asked her that she doesn\u2019t drink around me.  It worked out fine, she was great about not even drunk dialing me, a problem I had with my ex girlfriend.  \n\nWhen we started discussing moving in I was very apprehensive about it.  I asked her if she could really handle not drinking at all in our home and she was adamant that it was no big deal.  That if she wanted to drink she could just spend that night at a friends and that she really didn\u2019t drink that often anyways so it wouldn\u2019t be a problem.  \n\nThe first few months that\u2019s exactly what happened.  Since then though there have been times that she\u2019s come home obviously drunk and just lying about it to me.  I\u2019ve talked her about it to mixed reactions.  Sometimes she will apologize profusely and promise not to let it happen again.   Other times it becomes an argument about how I\u2019m projecting my mother\u2019s problem on our situation.  That she\u2019s not an alcoholic or abusive.  Which is true, but it\u2019s not really about her being abusive, it\u2019s that being around drunk people drudges up a lot of painful memories for me.  She just brushed that off though.  \n\nAfter this last time it happened she\u2019s outright fighting me on the issue.   She says this is her home too and we\u2019re both adults.   That I need to get therapy instead of trying to control her.  We had a clear agreement before we moved in though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is that the author has a history of an abusive alcoholic mother, which makes them uncomfortable around alcohol. They asked their girlfriend not to drink in their home, and she agreed. However, she's been coming home drunk and lying about it. The author is trying to address this, but the girlfriend is pushing back, saying it's her home too and that the author is projecting their past issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the boundaries they set before moving in. The author clearly communicated their needs because of their past trauma. The girlfriend agreed to those terms. If she's breaking that agreement, that's a problem. But maybe there's nuance here. The girlfriend isn't an alcoholic, so maybe she sees the rule as too restrictive. But the author's trauma is valid, and the agreement was mutual. \n\nThe girlfriend's reactions are mixed. Sometimes she apologizes, sometimes argues. The author is trying to maintain a safe space for themselves. The girlfriend's pushback might be about autonomy. However, agreements made to respect each other's boundaries should be upheld. If the girlfriend is violating those, even if it's not about addiction, it's about respecting the agreed-upon rules of their shared home.\n\nThe author's issue isn't about controlling but about their mental health and past. The girlfriend's argument that it's her home too might be true, but they agreed on specific terms. The fact that she's lying about being drunk adds another layer of dishonesty. The author isn't wrong for setting boundaries to protect their well-being. The girlfriend's refusal to honor the agreement could indicate a lack of respect for the author's needs, which is a problem in the relationship.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for asking her not to drink as per their agreement. The girlfriend is the one not honoring the terms they both agreed to. The author's trauma and need for a safe environment are valid. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
