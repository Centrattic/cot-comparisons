It was hell and as a result I don\u2019t drink at all and don\u2019t like being around drunk people.  \n\nWhen I started dating my girlfriend I knew that she drank and discussed my issues with it.  I just asked her that she doesn\u2019t drink around me.  It worked out fine, she was great about not even drunk dialing me, a problem I had with my ex girlfriend.  \n\nWhen we started discussing moving in I was very apprehensive about it.  I asked her if she could really handle not drinking at all in our home and she was adamant that it was no big deal.  That if she wanted to drink she could just spend that night at a friends and that she really didn\u2019t drink that often anyways so it wouldn\u2019t be a problem.  \n\nThe first few months that\u2019s exactly what happened.  Since then though there have been times that she\u2019s come home obviously drunk and just lying about it to me.  I\u2019ve talked her about it to mixed reactions.  Sometimes she will apologize profusely and promise not to let it happen again.   Other times it becomes an argument about how I\u2019m projecting my mother\u2019s problem on our situation.  That she\u2019s not an alcoholic or abusive.  Which is true, but it\u2019s not really about her being abusive, it\u2019s that being around drunk people drudges up a lot of painful memories for me.  She just brushed that off though.  \n\nAfter this last time it happened she\u2019s outright fighting me on the issue.   She says this is her home too and we\u2019re both adults.   That I need to get therapy instead of trying to control her.  We had a clear agreement before we moved in though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's girlfriend drinking despite previous agreements, causing distress because of his past with an alcoholic mother.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a valid reason for not wanting to be around drunk people due to trauma. He communicated his boundaries upfront, which is important. The girlfriend agreed not to drink at home but later broke that agreement, coming home drunk and lying about it. That's a breach of trust.\n\nThe girlfriend's arguments are that the author is projecting his mother's issues onto her, and that he should get therapy instead of controlling her. While she's not an alcoholic and isn't abusive, the author's emotional well-being is a legitimate concern. The problem isn't about controlling her but about his mental health and past trauma.\n\nThe author is trying to maintain a safe environment for himself. The girlfriend's reaction seems dismissive of his feelings, which is a problem. She's not respecting the agreed-upon boundaries. Communication has broken down, leading to arguments. The key here is whether the author is overstepping by asking her not to drink. But given his history, it's a necessary boundary. The girlfriend's refusal to honor the agreement and her deflection might put her in the wrong, but the question is about the author.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because he's setting reasonable boundaries based on his trauma. He communicated clearly, and the girlfriend isn't respecting those. So answer B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
