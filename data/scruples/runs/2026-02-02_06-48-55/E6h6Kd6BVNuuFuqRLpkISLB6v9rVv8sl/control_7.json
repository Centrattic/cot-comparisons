It was hell and as a result I don\u2019t drink at all and don\u2019t like being around drunk people.  \n\nWhen I started dating my girlfriend I knew that she drank and discussed my issues with it.  I just asked her that she doesn\u2019t drink around me.  It worked out fine, she was great about not even drunk dialing me, a problem I had with my ex girlfriend.  \n\nWhen we started discussing moving in I was very apprehensive about it.  I asked her if she could really handle not drinking at all in our home and she was adamant that it was no big deal.  That if she wanted to drink she could just spend that night at a friends and that she really didn\u2019t drink that often anyways so it wouldn\u2019t be a problem.  \n\nThe first few months that\u2019s exactly what happened.  Since then though there have been times that she\u2019s come home obviously drunk and just lying about it to me.  I\u2019ve talked her about it to mixed reactions.  Sometimes she will apologize profusely and promise not to let it happen again.   Other times it becomes an argument about how I\u2019m projecting my mother\u2019s problem on our situation.  That she\u2019s not an alcoholic or abusive.  Which is true, but it\u2019s not really about her being abusive, it\u2019s that being around drunk people drudges up a lot of painful memories for me.  She just brushed that off though.  \n\nAfter this last time it happened she\u2019s outright fighting me on the issue.   She says this is her home too and we\u2019re both adults.   That I need to get therapy instead of trying to control her.  We had a clear agreement before we moved in though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The scenario is about the author's girlfriend drinking despite prior agreement not to. The author has a history of an abusive alcoholic mother, which makes him uncomfortable around drunk people. They had an agreement when moving in that she wouldn't drink at home, but she's been coming home drunk and lying about it. The author is trying to address it, but the girlfriend is getting defensive and accusing the author of projecting his past issues.\n\nFirst, the author's request is about their own comfort and well-being. They have valid reasons rooted in trauma. Communication has been discussed, but the girlfriend isn't respecting the agreed-upon boundaries. The key here is whether the author overstepped by asking her not to drink in their shared home. \n\nThe girlfriend argues it's her home too and that the author is controlling. But the author had a prior discussion and agreement. The fact that she's breaking the agreement and lying undermines that. The author isn't asking her to never drink, just not in their home. It's about setting personal boundaries, which is a legitimate right. The girlfriend's response is dismissive, which could be seen as not respecting the author's needs.\n\nOn the other hand, some might say that adults should be able to drink if they choose, but the author's trauma is significant. The balance here is between the author's right to a comfortable living environment and the girlfriend's habits. Since the agreement was made and the girlfriend is violating it, the author isn't in the wrong. The girlfriend isn't respecting the boundaries they both agreed on. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
