It was hell and as a result I don\u2019t drink at all and don\u2019t like being around drunk people.  \n\nWhen I started dating my girlfriend I knew that she drank and discussed my issues with it.  I just asked her that she doesn\u2019t drink around me.  It worked out fine, she was great about not even drunk dialing me, a problem I had with my ex girlfriend.  \n\nWhen we started discussing moving in I was very apprehensive about it.  I asked her if she could really handle not drinking at all in our home and she was adamant that it was no big deal.  That if she wanted to drink she could just spend that night at a friends and that she really didn\u2019t drink that often anyways so it wouldn\u2019t be a problem.  \n\nThe first few months that\u2019s exactly what happened.  Since then though there have been times that she\u2019s come home obviously drunk and just lying about it to me.  I\u2019ve talked her about it to mixed reactions.  Sometimes she will apologize profusely and promise not to let it happen again.   Other times it becomes an argument about how I\u2019m projecting my mother\u2019s problem on our situation.  That she\u2019s not an alcoholic or abusive.  Which is true, but it\u2019s not really about her being abusive, it\u2019s that being around drunk people drudges up a lot of painful memories for me.  She just brushed that off though.  \n\nAfter this last time it happened she\u2019s outright fighting me on the issue.   She says this is her home too and we\u2019re both adults.   That I need to get therapy instead of trying to control her.  We had a clear agreement before we moved in though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author has a history of being in an abusive household with an alcoholic mother. This has made them very uncomfortable being around drunk people. Their girlfriend knew this and initially agreed not to drink around them. They even discussed moving in together, and she said it wasn't a problem for her to avoid drinking at home. But now, she's been coming home drunk and lying about it, leading to arguments.\n\nThe author is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for asking her not to drink. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author's trauma is valid. Their history with an abusive alcoholic mother is a legitimate reason for not wanting to be around drunk people. They communicated their boundaries clearly from the start. The girlfriend was aware of this and agreed to not drink around the author. That seems like a mutual agreement.\n\nWhen the relationship moved to cohabitation, the author asked again if she could handle not drinking at home. She said she could and mentioned she could go to a friend's if needed. So there was a clear understanding before moving in. Now, she's breaking that agreement by coming home drunk and lying about it. The author is trying to address it, but she's defensive, arguing that it's her home too and that the author is projecting their mother's issues onto her. She even suggests the author needs therapy instead of controlling her.\n\nI think the key points here are about boundaries and mutual respect. The author has the right to their boundaries based on past trauma. They communicated these boundaries upfront, and the girlfriend agreed. When she violates those boundaries, it's reasonable for the author to address it. The girlfriend's response of blaming the author and dismissing their feelings seems to be the issue here.\n\nThe author isn't trying to control her in an abusive way; they're asking her to respect their boundaries. The fact that the girlfriend is now fighting against this despite the prior agreement might indicate a problem on her side. The author's actions are about their well-being and the trust established in the relationship.\n\nSo, considering all that, I don't think the author is in the wrong. They have a valid reason for their request, and they made it clear from the beginning. The girlfriend is the one not honoring the agreement and being dismissive. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
