It was hell and as a result I don\u2019t drink at all and don\u2019t like being around drunk people.  \n\nWhen I started dating my girlfriend I knew that she drank and discussed my issues with it.  I just asked her that she doesn\u2019t drink around me.  It worked out fine, she was great about not even drunk dialing me, a problem I had with my ex girlfriend.  \n\nWhen we started discussing moving in I was very apprehensive about it.  I asked her if she could really handle not drinking at all in our home and she was adamant that it was no big deal.  That if she wanted to drink she could just spend that night at a friends and that she really didn\u2019t drink that often anyways so it wouldn\u2019t be a problem.  \n\nThe first few months that\u2019s exactly what happened.  Since then though there have been times that she\u2019s come home obviously drunk and just lying about it to me.  I\u2019ve talked her about it to mixed reactions.  Sometimes she will apologize profusely and promise not to let it happen again.   Other times it becomes an argument about how I\u2019m projecting my mother\u2019s problem on our situation.  That she\u2019s not an alcoholic or abusive.  Which is true, but it\u2019s not really about her being abusive, it\u2019s that being around drunk people drudges up a lot of painful memories for me.  She just brushed that off though.  \n\nAfter this last time it happened she\u2019s outright fighting me on the issue.   She says this is her home too and we\u2019re both adults.   That I need to get therapy instead of trying to control her.  We had a clear agreement before we moved in though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about setting boundaries regarding alcohol in their relationship.\n\nFirst, the author has a history of being abused by an alcoholic mother, which caused them trauma. They don't drink and are uncomfortable around people who drink. When they started dating their girlfriend, they communicated this issue and she agreed not to drink around them. They also discussed moving in together, and she said she could handle not drinking at home. However, she started coming home drunk and lying about it. The author talks to her about it, but she gets defensive, argues that the author is projecting past trauma, and says the author should get therapy instead.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. Let's break it down. The key points are communication, boundaries, and mutual respect. The author clearly communicated their needs upfront, and the girlfriend agreed to the terms. When the girlfriend breaks those agreed-upon boundaries, it's a problem. The author is trying to address their emotional well-being by maintaining this boundary, which is valid given their background. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend is now violating the agreement, which the author is trying to address. The girlfriend's response is dismissive and confrontational, which could indicate she's not respecting the boundary the author has set. The author's request is about their own comfort and mental health, not about controlling the girlfriend's actions outside the home. The girlfriend's argument that they're both adults and it's her home too might be missing the point that the original agreement was mutual. \n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's boundaries is crucial. If one party sets a boundary and the other repeatedly violates it without effort to accommodate, that's a problem. The author isn't controlling; they've set a clear boundary based on their trauma. The girlfriend's actions and responses suggest she's not respecting that, which would place the blame on her. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for asking her not to drink in their shared home as agreed. The answer should be B (No).\n"
