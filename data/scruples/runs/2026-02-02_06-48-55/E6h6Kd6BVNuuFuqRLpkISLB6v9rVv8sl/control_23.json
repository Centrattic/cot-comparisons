It was hell and as a result I don\u2019t drink at all and don\u2019t like being around drunk people.  \n\nWhen I started dating my girlfriend I knew that she drank and discussed my issues with it.  I just asked her that she doesn\u2019t drink around me.  It worked out fine, she was great about not even drunk dialing me, a problem I had with my ex girlfriend.  \n\nWhen we started discussing moving in I was very apprehensive about it.  I asked her if she could really handle not drinking at all in our home and she was adamant that it was no big deal.  That if she wanted to drink she could just spend that night at a friends and that she really didn\u2019t drink that often anyways so it wouldn\u2019t be a problem.  \n\nThe first few months that\u2019s exactly what happened.  Since then though there have been times that she\u2019s come home obviously drunk and just lying about it to me.  I\u2019ve talked her about it to mixed reactions.  Sometimes she will apologize profusely and promise not to let it happen again.   Other times it becomes an argument about how I\u2019m projecting my mother\u2019s problem on our situation.  That she\u2019s not an alcoholic or abusive.  Which is true, but it\u2019s not really about her being abusive, it\u2019s that being around drunk people drudges up a lot of painful memories for me.  She just brushed that off though.  \n\nAfter this last time it happened she\u2019s outright fighting me on the issue.   She says this is her home too and we\u2019re both adults.   That I need to get therapy instead of trying to control her.  We had a clear agreement before we moved in though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a couple where the author has a history of growing up with an abusive alcoholic mother. Because of that, they don't drink and don't like being around drunk people. They told their girlfriend about this when they started dating, and she agreed not to drink around them. When they moved in together, there was an agreement that she wouldn't drink at home, but now she's coming home drunk and lying about it. The author is upset, and the girlfriend is pushing back, saying it's her home too and the author should get therapy instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the boundaries that were set before moving in. The author had a clear discussion and the girlfriend initially respected that. Now she's breaking the agreement. The author's request seems reasonable given their trauma. It's important to respect someone's mental health needs, especially when there's a history of abuse. The girlfriend is now coming home drunk and lying, which violates the original agreement. The author is trying to communicate their needs, but the girlfriend is dismissing their feelings, comparing it to projection, and saying the author needs therapy instead.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that her autonomy is being restricted. She's an adult and might believe she has the right to drink in her own home. But the problem is that the author's well-being is at stake here. The fact that there was an agreement before moving in is crucial. If the girlfriend agreed to not drink at home, then breaking that agreement is a breach. Her response of fighting the author and suggesting therapy instead of addressing the issue is not supportive.\n\nThe key points here are the initial agreement, the author's valid emotional reasons, the girlfriend's subsequent actions violating that agreement, and her dismissive attitude. The author isn't controlling; they're setting boundaries based on their past. The girlfriend's behavior is the issue here. So the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
