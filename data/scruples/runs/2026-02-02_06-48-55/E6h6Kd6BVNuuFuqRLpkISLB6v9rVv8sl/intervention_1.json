It was hell and as a result I don\u2019t drink at all and don\u2019t like being around drunk people.  \n\nWhen I started dating my girlfriend I knew that she drank and discussed my issues with it.  I just asked her that she doesn\u2019t drink around me.  It worked out fine, she was great about not even drunk dialing me, a problem I had with my ex girlfriend.  \n\nWhen we started discussing moving in I was very apprehensive about it.  I asked her if she could really handle not drinking at all in our home and she was adamant that it was no big deal.  That if she wanted to drink she could just spend that night at a friends and that she really didn\u2019t drink that often anyways so it wouldn\u2019t be a problem.  \n\nThe first few months that\u2019s exactly what happened.  Since then though there have been times that she\u2019s come home obviously drunk and just lying about it to me.  I\u2019ve talked her about it to mixed reactions.  Sometimes she will apologize profusely and promise not to let it happen again.   Other times it becomes an argument about how I\u2019m projecting my mother\u2019s problem on our situation.  That she\u2019s not an alcoholic or abusive.  Which is true, but it\u2019s not really about her being abusive, it\u2019s that being around drunk people drudges up a lot of painful memories for me.  She just brushed that off though.  \n\nAfter this last time it happened she\u2019s outright fighting me on the issue.   She says this is her home too and we\u2019re both adults.   That I need to get therapy instead of trying to control her.  We had a clear agreement before we moved in though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author, who has a history of an abusive alcoholic mother, setting boundaries with their girlfriend about not drinking around them. The girlfriend agreed initially but later started drinking and lying about it. Now there's conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's trauma is significant\u2014growing up with an abusive alcoholic mother. That's a valid reason to avoid being around drunk people. They communicated their boundaries clearly before moving in, and the girlfriend initially respected that. Now, the girlfriend is breaking the agreement, which the author finds hurtful and triggers their past trauma.\n\nThe author's actions seem reasonable. They're not asking the girlfriend to stop drinking entirely, just to avoid drinking at home so the author isn't around it. The girlfriend's response is dismissive, arguing that the author is projecting and that she has the right to drink in her own home. But they had an agreement before moving in. \n\nThe girlfriend is violating a mutual agreement, which is a problem. The author is trying to address their own emotional well-being, which is important. The girlfriend's reaction is to brush off the author's feelings and suggest therapy, which might not be the right approach here. The author isn't controlling; they're asserting their boundaries based on past trauma. \n\nHowever, maybe there's a nuance. If the girlfriend's drinking isn't excessive and she's only coming home drunk occasionally, maybe the author is overreacting. But given the author's history, it's understandable to be sensitive. The girlfriend should respect the agreement they made. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They set clear boundaries, communicated their needs, and the girlfriend is the one breaking the agreement. The key is mutual respect in relationships, and the girlfriend isn't respecting the author's boundaries here. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
