It was hell and as a result I don\u2019t drink at all and don\u2019t like being around drunk people.  \n\nWhen I started dating my girlfriend I knew that she drank and discussed my issues with it.  I just asked her that she doesn\u2019t drink around me.  It worked out fine, she was great about not even drunk dialing me, a problem I had with my ex girlfriend.  \n\nWhen we started discussing moving in I was very apprehensive about it.  I asked her if she could really handle not drinking at all in our home and she was adamant that it was no big deal.  That if she wanted to drink she could just spend that night at a friends and that she really didn\u2019t drink that often anyways so it wouldn\u2019t be a problem.  \n\nThe first few months that\u2019s exactly what happened.  Since then though there have been times that she\u2019s come home obviously drunk and just lying about it to me.  I\u2019ve talked her about it to mixed reactions.  Sometimes she will apologize profusely and promise not to let it happen again.   Other times it becomes an argument about how I\u2019m projecting my mother\u2019s problem on our situation.  That she\u2019s not an alcoholic or abusive.  Which is true, but it\u2019s not really about her being abusive, it\u2019s that being around drunk people drudges up a lot of painful memories for me.  She just brushed that off though.  \n\nAfter this last time it happened she\u2019s outright fighting me on the issue.   She says this is her home too and we\u2019re both adults.   That I need to get therapy instead of trying to control her.  We had a clear agreement before we moved in though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author has a history of being abused by an alcoholic mother, which makes them uncomfortable around alcohol and drunk people. When they started dating their girlfriend, they discussed this and she agreed not to drink around them. That worked well until they moved in together. The author asked again if she could handle not drinking at home, and she said it was no problem, planning to go to friends' if she wanted to drink. Initially, that's what happened, but now she's coming home drunk and lying about it. The author has brought this up, and there's been some back and forth. The girlfriend is now arguing that it's their home and the author should get therapy instead of controlling her. The author is upset because there was an agreement before moving in.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for asking their girlfriend not to drink in their shared home. \n\nFirst, the author has valid emotional reasons due to their traumatic past. They were clear about their boundaries and the girlfriend initially respected them. The problem now is that the girlfriend isn't following through, and the author is trying to address it, but she's not listening and is dismissing their feelings. \n\nIs the author overstepping? Well, they didn't ask her to stop drinking entirely, just not to drink in their home and to avoid being around them when drunk. Since they were upfront about it beforehand, and the girlfriend agreed, then it seems like a mutual agreement. The girlfriend is breaking that now, which is a problem. The author is trying to maintain their emotional safety, which is important. \n\nOn the other hand, once they moved in together, the girlfriend might feel like she has the right to make her own choices in her home. But since there was an agreement, the author is within their rights to hold her to that. The girlfriend's argument that the author is \"controlling\" might be a deflection if she's not respecting the prior agreement. \n\nThe author isn't trying to control her; they're trying to protect their mental health. The girlfriend's drinking and lying is a breach of trust. The author is justified in being upset and trying to address the issue. The girlfriend's response of suggesting therapy is dismissive and doesn't address the actual problem of breaking the agreement. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They set boundaries, communicated them, and the girlfriend isn't respecting those. The author's actions are about their well-being, not controlling someone else. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
