It was hell and as a result I don\u2019t drink at all and don\u2019t like being around drunk people.  \n\nWhen I started dating my girlfriend I knew that she drank and discussed my issues with it.  I just asked her that she doesn\u2019t drink around me.  It worked out fine, she was great about not even drunk dialing me, a problem I had with my ex girlfriend.  \n\nWhen we started discussing moving in I was very apprehensive about it.  I asked her if she could really handle not drinking at all in our home and she was adamant that it was no big deal.  That if she wanted to drink she could just spend that night at a friends and that she really didn\u2019t drink that often anyways so it wouldn\u2019t be a problem.  \n\nThe first few months that\u2019s exactly what happened.  Since then though there have been times that she\u2019s come home obviously drunk and just lying about it to me.  I\u2019ve talked her about it to mixed reactions.  Sometimes she will apologize profusely and promise not to let it happen again.   Other times it becomes an argument about how I\u2019m projecting my mother\u2019s problem on our situation.  That she\u2019s not an alcoholic or abusive.  Which is true, but it\u2019s not really about her being abusive, it\u2019s that being around drunk people drudges up a lot of painful memories for me.  She just brushed that off though.  \n\nAfter this last time it happened she\u2019s outright fighting me on the issue.   She says this is her home too and we\u2019re both adults.   That I need to get therapy instead of trying to control her.  We had a clear agreement before we moved in though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author has a traumatic past with an abusive alcoholic mother, which makes them uncomfortable around alcohol. They asked their girlfriend not to drink around them, and initially, it worked. Then when they moved in together, the girlfriend agreed to not drink at home. But recently, she's been coming home drunk and lying about it. The author confronts her, but she's defensive, saying it's not about abuse and that the author should get therapy instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They have valid reasons rooted in their upbringing. Their request was about their own comfort and mental health. They discussed this upfront, and the girlfriend initially respected the boundary. Now, the girlfriend is breaking that agreement, which causes distress to the author. The author isn't trying to control her, just avoiding situations that trigger their trauma.\n\nOn the other side, the girlfriend feels that since they live together, she should have some freedom. She's not an alcoholic, so she might see the author's request as too restrictive. However, they had a mutual agreement before moving in. Breaking that agreement could be seen as disregarding the author's needs.\n\nThe key points are: the author's right to their emotional well-being, the agreement made before moving in, and the girlfriend's actions violating that agreement. The girlfriend's defense is that the author is projecting their past issues, but the author isn't accusing her of being abusive; they're just trying to avoid triggers.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong. They had a valid reason and an agreement. The girlfriend breaking that agreement and dismissing the author's feelings is the issue here. The author is advocating for their own mental health, which is reasonable. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
