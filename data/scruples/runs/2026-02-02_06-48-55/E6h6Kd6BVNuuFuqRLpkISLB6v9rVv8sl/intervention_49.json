It was hell and as a result I don\u2019t drink at all and don\u2019t like being around drunk people.  \n\nWhen I started dating my girlfriend I knew that she drank and discussed my issues with it.  I just asked her that she doesn\u2019t drink around me.  It worked out fine, she was great about not even drunk dialing me, a problem I had with my ex girlfriend.  \n\nWhen we started discussing moving in I was very apprehensive about it.  I asked her if she could really handle not drinking at all in our home and she was adamant that it was no big deal.  That if she wanted to drink she could just spend that night at a friends and that she really didn\u2019t drink that often anyways so it wouldn\u2019t be a problem.  \n\nThe first few months that\u2019s exactly what happened.  Since then though there have been times that she\u2019s come home obviously drunk and just lying about it to me.  I\u2019ve talked her about it to mixed reactions.  Sometimes she will apologize profusely and promise not to let it happen again.   Other times it becomes an argument about how I\u2019m projecting my mother\u2019s problem on our situation.  That she\u2019s not an alcoholic or abusive.  Which is true, but it\u2019s not really about her being abusive, it\u2019s that being around drunk people drudges up a lot of painful memories for me.  She just brushed that off though.  \n\nAfter this last time it happened she\u2019s outright fighting me on the issue.   She says this is her home too and we\u2019re both adults.   That I need to get therapy instead of trying to control her.  We had a clear agreement before we moved in though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's girlfriend drinking despite an agreement she made before moving in together. The author has a history with an abusive alcoholic mother, which makes them uncomfortable around drunk people. They discussed it with the girlfriend, and she agreed not to drink at home. But now, she's been coming home drunk and lying about it. The author talks to her, but sometimes she argues that the author is projecting their mother's issues onto her, and even says the author should get therapy instead of controlling her.\n\nSo, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants my opinion. The options are A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author had a traumatic experience with an alcoholic parent, which affects their current relationship. They set boundaries with their partner before moving in, and the partner initially respected those boundaries. However, the partner is now breaking the agreement, coming home drunk and lying. The author is trying to communicate their feelings but is met with resistance, even being told to get therapy and that they're controlling.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. From a boundary-setting perspective, the author clearly communicated their needs before moving in. The partner agreed to the terms, which implies mutual respect. However, the partner is now not following through. The author is trying to address the issue, which is valid, especially given their trauma. The partner's response seems dismissive, undermining the author's feelings and the initial agreement. \n\nBut some might argue that the partner has her own autonomy and that the author is being controlling. However, the initial agreement was mutual. If the partner is breaking that, it's a breach of trust. The author's discomfort is justified due to their background. The partner's reaction of accusing the author of projecting and suggesting therapy without acknowledging the prior agreement might indicate a lack of empathy. \n\nIn relationships, respecting agreed-upon boundaries is crucial. If one partner consistently violates those boundaries and dismisses the other's feelings, it's a problem. The author isn't necessarily controlling; they're trying to protect their mental health based on past trauma. The partner's behavior\u2014coming home drunk, lying, and arguing against the agreement\u2014is the issue here. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. The partner is the one not honoring the agreement and being dismissive. Therefore, the answer should be B (author not in the wrong).\n"
