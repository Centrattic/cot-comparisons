It was hell and as a result I don\u2019t drink at all and don\u2019t like being around drunk people.  \n\nWhen I started dating my girlfriend I knew that she drank and discussed my issues with it.  I just asked her that she doesn\u2019t drink around me.  It worked out fine, she was great about not even drunk dialing me, a problem I had with my ex girlfriend.  \n\nWhen we started discussing moving in I was very apprehensive about it.  I asked her if she could really handle not drinking at all in our home and she was adamant that it was no big deal.  That if she wanted to drink she could just spend that night at a friends and that she really didn\u2019t drink that often anyways so it wouldn\u2019t be a problem.  \n\nThe first few months that\u2019s exactly what happened.  Since then though there have been times that she\u2019s come home obviously drunk and just lying about it to me.  I\u2019ve talked her about it to mixed reactions.  Sometimes she will apologize profusely and promise not to let it happen again.   Other times it becomes an argument about how I\u2019m projecting my mother\u2019s problem on our situation.  That she\u2019s not an alcoholic or abusive.  Which is true, but it\u2019s not really about her being abusive, it\u2019s that being around drunk people drudges up a lot of painful memories for me.  She just brushed that off though.  \n\nAfter this last time it happened she\u2019s outright fighting me on the issue.   She says this is her home too and we\u2019re both adults.   That I need to get therapy instead of trying to control her.  We had a clear agreement before we moved in though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author has a history of an abusive alcoholic mother, which makes them uncomfortable around drunk people. They asked their girlfriend not to drink around them, and she agreed before they moved in together. But now, she's been coming home drunk and lying about it, leading to arguments.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is valid because their trauma is real. They have a legitimate reason for not wanting to be around drunk people. They communicated their boundaries upfront, and the girlfriend initially respected them. However, the girlfriend is now breaking that agreement, which is a problem because agreements in relationships are important for trust and respect.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that her autonomy is being restricted. She's an adult and might believe she should have the freedom to drink, even at home. But the key point is that they had an agreement before moving in. If she's breaking that agreement, it's a breach of trust. The author is trying to protect their mental health, which is a valid concern.\n\nThe girlfriend's response that the author is projecting their mother's issues onto the relationship is a defense mechanism. While she's not an alcoholic or abusive, the author's issue isn't about her behavior but their own triggers. The girlfriend's arguments about the author needing therapy instead of controlling her seem dismissive of the author's legitimate trauma and agreed-upon boundaries.\n\nSo, considering the initial agreement and the fact that the author communicated their needs clearly, the girlfriend is the one not honoring the agreement. The author is not in the wrong for setting boundaries based on their past. The problem lies in the girlfriend's actions violating that agreement. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
