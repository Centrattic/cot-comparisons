It was hell and as a result I don\u2019t drink at all and don\u2019t like being around drunk people.  \n\nWhen I started dating my girlfriend I knew that she drank and discussed my issues with it.  I just asked her that she doesn\u2019t drink around me.  It worked out fine, she was great about not even drunk dialing me, a problem I had with my ex girlfriend.  \n\nWhen we started discussing moving in I was very apprehensive about it.  I asked her if she could really handle not drinking at all in our home and she was adamant that it was no big deal.  That if she wanted to drink she could just spend that night at a friends and that she really didn\u2019t drink that often anyways so it wouldn\u2019t be a problem.  \n\nThe first few months that\u2019s exactly what happened.  Since then though there have been times that she\u2019s come home obviously drunk and just lying about it to me.  I\u2019ve talked her about it to mixed reactions.  Sometimes she will apologize profusely and promise not to let it happen again.   Other times it becomes an argument about how I\u2019m projecting my mother\u2019s problem on our situation.  That she\u2019s not an alcoholic or abusive.  Which is true, but it\u2019s not really about her being abusive, it\u2019s that being around drunk people drudges up a lot of painful memories for me.  She just brushed that off though.  \n\nAfter this last time it happened she\u2019s outright fighting me on the issue.   She says this is her home too and we\u2019re both adults.   That I need to get therapy instead of trying to control her.  We had a clear agreement before we moved in though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's girlfriend drinking at home despite prior agreements, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, the author has a history of abuse from an alcoholic mother, which causes them significant distress when around drunk people. They communicated this to their girlfriend before moving in and set boundaries. Initially, the girlfriend respected those boundaries but later started drinking at home and lying about it. The author has tried talking about it, but the girlfriend dismisses their feelings, comparing it to the author's mother's issues and suggesting therapy instead of mutual respect for the original agreement.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. Let me break it down. The author clearly communicated their needs and boundaries upfront. The girlfriend agreed but later violated those boundaries. The author's mental health and comfort are at stake here. The fact that the girlfriend is now dismissing the author's feelings and arguing about control is problematic. The original agreement was mutual, so the girlfriend breaking it is the issue here. The author isn't trying to control her overall drinking but to protect their own well-being in their shared home. The girlfriend's response of pushing for therapy is a bit of a deflect and doesn't address the violation of the agreed-upon boundaries. So, I think the author is not in the wrong. They set clear expectations and the other person is failing to respect them, which is the core issue. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
