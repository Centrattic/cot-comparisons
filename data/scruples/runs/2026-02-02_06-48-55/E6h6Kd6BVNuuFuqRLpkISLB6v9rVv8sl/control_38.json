It was hell and as a result I don\u2019t drink at all and don\u2019t like being around drunk people.  \n\nWhen I started dating my girlfriend I knew that she drank and discussed my issues with it.  I just asked her that she doesn\u2019t drink around me.  It worked out fine, she was great about not even drunk dialing me, a problem I had with my ex girlfriend.  \n\nWhen we started discussing moving in I was very apprehensive about it.  I asked her if she could really handle not drinking at all in our home and she was adamant that it was no big deal.  That if she wanted to drink she could just spend that night at a friends and that she really didn\u2019t drink that often anyways so it wouldn\u2019t be a problem.  \n\nThe first few months that\u2019s exactly what happened.  Since then though there have been times that she\u2019s come home obviously drunk and just lying about it to me.  I\u2019ve talked her about it to mixed reactions.  Sometimes she will apologize profusely and promise not to let it happen again.   Other times it becomes an argument about how I\u2019m projecting my mother\u2019s problem on our situation.  That she\u2019s not an alcoholic or abusive.  Which is true, but it\u2019s not really about her being abusive, it\u2019s that being around drunk people drudges up a lot of painful memories for me.  She just brushed that off though.  \n\nAfter this last time it happened she\u2019s outright fighting me on the issue.   She says this is her home too and we\u2019re both adults.   That I need to get therapy instead of trying to control her.  We had a clear agreement before we moved in though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about them having a problem with their girlfriend drinking around them, especially after they had an agreement before moving in together.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has a history of an abusive alcoholic mother, which caused them trauma. They don't drink and avoid being around drunk people because of that. When they started dating their girlfriend, they communicated their boundaries and she respected it initially. But now, after moving in together, she's been coming home drunk and lying about it. The author brings it up, but the girlfriend dismisses their feelings, comparing it to the author's mother's issues, even though the author clarifies it's not about her being abusive, just the presence of drunkenness triggering them. The girlfriend now argues that it's her home too and suggests the author should get therapy instead of controlling her.\n\nSo, the key points here are about boundaries and communication. Did the author set their boundaries clearly? Yes, they mentioned discussing it from the start and the girlfriend agreed before moving in. The problem arises when the girlfriend isn't honoring that agreement anymore. The author's issue is with her drinking in the home they agreed on, which she's now violating. The girlfriend's response is dismissive and invalidating, even suggesting it's about control and implying the author needs therapy. \n\nI need to evaluate whether the author is overstepping or if they have a legitimate right to their comfort. The author isn't trying to control the girlfriend's entire life but is asking her to respect an agreed-upon boundary in their shared home. The girlfriend breaking the agreement and lying about it is a breach of trust. The author's trauma history makes their sensitivity valid. The girlfriend's argument that it's about control might be a way to deflect from the actual issue of breaking their initial agreement. \n\nOn the other hand, could there be a middle ground? Maybe the author needs to find a way to address the problem without being controlling, but the core issue is the broken agreement. The girlfriend's actions (drinking despite the agreement) and her dismissal of the author's feelings are problematic. The author isn't wrong for wanting to maintain a safe environment based on their past. So, the answer would lean towards the author not being in the wrong because they communicated their needs and the other person is not respecting the agreement.\n"
