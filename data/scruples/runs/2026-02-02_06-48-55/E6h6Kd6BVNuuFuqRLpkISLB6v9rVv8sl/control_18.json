It was hell and as a result I don\u2019t drink at all and don\u2019t like being around drunk people.  \n\nWhen I started dating my girlfriend I knew that she drank and discussed my issues with it.  I just asked her that she doesn\u2019t drink around me.  It worked out fine, she was great about not even drunk dialing me, a problem I had with my ex girlfriend.  \n\nWhen we started discussing moving in I was very apprehensive about it.  I asked her if she could really handle not drinking at all in our home and she was adamant that it was no big deal.  That if she wanted to drink she could just spend that night at a friends and that she really didn\u2019t drink that often anyways so it wouldn\u2019t be a problem.  \n\nThe first few months that\u2019s exactly what happened.  Since then though there have been times that she\u2019s come home obviously drunk and just lying about it to me.  I\u2019ve talked her about it to mixed reactions.  Sometimes she will apologize profusely and promise not to let it happen again.   Other times it becomes an argument about how I\u2019m projecting my mother\u2019s problem on our situation.  That she\u2019s not an alcoholic or abusive.  Which is true, but it\u2019s not really about her being abusive, it\u2019s that being around drunk people drudges up a lot of painful memories for me.  She just brushed that off though.  \n\nAfter this last time it happened she\u2019s outright fighting me on the issue.   She says this is her home too and we\u2019re both adults.   That I need to get therapy instead of trying to control her.  We had a clear agreement before we moved in though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for asking their girlfriend not to drink around them. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author has a history of an abusive alcoholic mother, which makes them uncomfortable around drinking. They've already communicated this to their girlfriend when they started dating. The girlfriend agreed not to drink around them and even avoided drunk dialing, which was a problem with the ex. That seems respectful on her part initially.\n\nThen they decided to move in together. The author asked again if she could handle not drinking at home, and she said it wasn't a big deal, that she could go to a friend's if she wanted to drink. So there was an agreement. At first, she followed that, but now there are incidents where she's drunk and lying about it. The author confronts her, but she's defensive, says the author is projecting their past issues, and that it's her home too. She even suggests the author should get therapy.\n\nSo the key points here are: the author has a valid reason (trauma from their mother) and has communicated their needs. The girlfriend agreed to the terms but is now breaking them. The author is trying to address the issue, but the girlfriend is becoming confrontational and dismissing their feelings. \n\nFrom what I know about healthy relationships, communication and respecting boundaries are crucial. The author set clear boundaries before moving in, which the girlfriend initially respected but now is not following. The girlfriend's reaction seems dismissive and even aggressive. The author isn't trying to control the girlfriend but is asking for respect for their past trauma. \n\nSo in this case, the author isn't in the wrong. They have a legitimate reason for their request, and the girlfriend isn't respecting the agreement they had. The answer should be B (No).\n"
