It was hell and as a result I don\u2019t drink at all and don\u2019t like being around drunk people.  \n\nWhen I started dating my girlfriend I knew that she drank and discussed my issues with it.  I just asked her that she doesn\u2019t drink around me.  It worked out fine, she was great about not even drunk dialing me, a problem I had with my ex girlfriend.  \n\nWhen we started discussing moving in I was very apprehensive about it.  I asked her if she could really handle not drinking at all in our home and she was adamant that it was no big deal.  That if she wanted to drink she could just spend that night at a friends and that she really didn\u2019t drink that often anyways so it wouldn\u2019t be a problem.  \n\nThe first few months that\u2019s exactly what happened.  Since then though there have been times that she\u2019s come home obviously drunk and just lying about it to me.  I\u2019ve talked her about it to mixed reactions.  Sometimes she will apologize profusely and promise not to let it happen again.   Other times it becomes an argument about how I\u2019m projecting my mother\u2019s problem on our situation.  That she\u2019s not an alcoholic or abusive.  Which is true, but it\u2019s not really about her being abusive, it\u2019s that being around drunk people drudges up a lot of painful memories for me.  She just brushed that off though.  \n\nAfter this last time it happened she\u2019s outright fighting me on the issue.   She says this is her home too and we\u2019re both adults.   That I need to get therapy instead of trying to control her.  We had a clear agreement before we moved in though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's issues with alcohol due to their abusive alcoholic mother. They don't drink and don't like being around drunk people. When they started dating their girlfriend, they discussed this and she agreed not to drink around them. When they moved in together, she initially respected that, but now she's been coming home drunk and lying about it. The author confronts her, but she argues that the author is projecting their past trauma onto her and insists she's not an alcoholic. Now the author is being accused of controlling behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author's actions are reasonable. The author has a valid reason based on their traumatic experience. They communicated their boundaries clearly before moving in, and the girlfriend agreed to those terms. The girlfriend is breaking the agreement by drinking despite the prior understanding. The author is trying to address the issue, but the girlfriend is now accusing them of controlling behavior, which complicates things.\n\nHowever, relationships require mutual respect and communication. The author might be in the right to set boundaries, but if they're being too controlling or not allowing any flexibility, that could be a problem. But in this case, the author had a prior agreement, and the girlfriend is breaking it. The girlfriend's behavior is violating the terms they both agreed upon. The author is trying to address a legitimate emotional issue, not just being controlling for no reason.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that her autonomy is being restricted. But the initial agreement was mutual. The author's request isn't about controlling every aspect but about respecting their trauma and creating a safe environment. The fact that the girlfriend is now coming home drunk and lying suggests she's not honoring the agreement, which the author is trying to address.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is not in the wrong. They have valid reasons rooted in their past trauma, they communicated their boundaries upfront, and the girlfriend is the one breaking the agreement. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
