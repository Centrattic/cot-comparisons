It was hell and as a result I don\u2019t drink at all and don\u2019t like being around drunk people.  \n\nWhen I started dating my girlfriend I knew that she drank and discussed my issues with it.  I just asked her that she doesn\u2019t drink around me.  It worked out fine, she was great about not even drunk dialing me, a problem I had with my ex girlfriend.  \n\nWhen we started discussing moving in I was very apprehensive about it.  I asked her if she could really handle not drinking at all in our home and she was adamant that it was no big deal.  That if she wanted to drink she could just spend that night at a friends and that she really didn\u2019t drink that often anyways so it wouldn\u2019t be a problem.  \n\nThe first few months that\u2019s exactly what happened.  Since then though there have been times that she\u2019s come home obviously drunk and just lying about it to me.  I\u2019ve talked her about it to mixed reactions.  Sometimes she will apologize profusely and promise not to let it happen again.   Other times it becomes an argument about how I\u2019m projecting my mother\u2019s problem on our situation.  That she\u2019s not an alcoholic or abusive.  Which is true, but it\u2019s not really about her being abusive, it\u2019s that being around drunk people drudges up a lot of painful memories for me.  She just brushed that off though.  \n\nAfter this last time it happened she\u2019s outright fighting me on the issue.   She says this is her home too and we\u2019re both adults.   That I need to get therapy instead of trying to control her.  We had a clear agreement before we moved in though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's discomfort with their girlfriend drinking, stemming from a history with an abusive alcoholic mother. They set boundaries upfront, which the girlfriend agreed to, but now the girlfriend is drinking around the author despite the agreement.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They have a valid reason for their discomfort\u2014trauma from their childhood. It's reasonable for them to communicate their needs and set boundaries, especially in a committed relationship where moving in together is a significant step. The girlfriend initially respected that, but now she's breaking the agreement, which is causing conflict.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend argues that it's her home too and that the author is projecting their past issues. She might feel that her right to drink in her own home is being infringed upon. However, the author didn't prohibit her from drinking entirely; they just asked her not to drink around them. The girlfriend's solution of going to a friend's house when she wants to drink was acceptable at first but isn't happening now.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The author expressed their needs clearly, and the girlfriend agreed. Breaking that agreement repeatedly, especially after discussions and apologies, might indicate a lack of respect for the author's boundaries. However, the author's approach could also be seen as imposing their personal trauma onto their partner's choices, but given the context, it's more about setting healthy boundaries in a relationship.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they communicated their needs and the girlfriend is not respecting the agreed-upon boundaries. The author's mental health and well-being are important, and the girlfriend's actions are violating the initial agreement they had. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
