It was hell and as a result I don\u2019t drink at all and don\u2019t like being around drunk people.  \n\nWhen I started dating my girlfriend I knew that she drank and discussed my issues with it.  I just asked her that she doesn\u2019t drink around me.  It worked out fine, she was great about not even drunk dialing me, a problem I had with my ex girlfriend.  \n\nWhen we started discussing moving in I was very apprehensive about it.  I asked her if she could really handle not drinking at all in our home and she was adamant that it was no big deal.  That if she wanted to drink she could just spend that night at a friends and that she really didn\u2019t drink that often anyways so it wouldn\u2019t be a problem.  \n\nThe first few months that\u2019s exactly what happened.  Since then though there have been times that she\u2019s come home obviously drunk and just lying about it to me.  I\u2019ve talked her about it to mixed reactions.  Sometimes she will apologize profusely and promise not to let it happen again.   Other times it becomes an argument about how I\u2019m projecting my mother\u2019s problem on our situation.  That she\u2019s not an alcoholic or abusive.  Which is true, but it\u2019s not really about her being abusive, it\u2019s that being around drunk people drudges up a lot of painful memories for me.  She just brushed that off though.  \n\nAfter this last time it happened she\u2019s outright fighting me on the issue.   She says this is her home too and we\u2019re both adults.   That I need to get therapy instead of trying to control her.  We had a clear agreement before we moved in though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong. So, the author is a person who has a history of an abusive alcoholic mother. Because of that, they don't drink and don't like being around drunk people. They mentioned this to their girlfriend when they started dating and asked her not to drink around them. The girlfriend was good about not drunk dialing, which was a problem with their ex. Then they discussed moving in together, and the author asked if the girlfriend could handle not drinking at all in their home. The girlfriend said it wasn't a big deal, that she could go to friends' if she wanted to drink and that she doesn't drink often.\n\nInitially, that's what happened, but recently she's come home drunk and lied about it. The author talked to her, but reactions were mixed. Sometimes she apologized, sometimes she argued that the author is projecting their mother's issues onto their relationship, and said she's not an alcoholic or abusive. The author clarified it's not about her being abusive, just the memories. The girlfriend dismissed that and now is fighting back, saying it's her home too, they're adults, and the author should get therapy instead of controlling her. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but is curious for my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author has valid trauma from their past. They communicated their boundaries clearly from the start. The girlfriend agreed to those boundaries before moving in. Now, however, the girlfriend is not respecting those boundaries by coming home drunk and lying. The author is trying to address the issue, but the girlfriend is becoming defensive and dismissive.\n\nThe key points here are about consent and boundaries. The author set a boundary, and the girlfriend agreed to it. If the girlfriend is breaking that agreement, then the author isn't in the wrong for asking her not to drink in their home. The girlfriend's argument that it's her home too might be a red herring; they are in a relationship and shared living space, so mutual agreements should be respected. The author is not trying to control her but to maintain their own mental health and well-being based on past trauma.\n\nHowever, it's possible that the author's request is too strict, but the problem here is that the girlfriend is not honoring the agreed-upon terms. The author is in a vulnerable position due to their history, and the girlfriend's actions are causing distress. The girlfriend's response of dismissing the author's feelings and suggesting therapy might be invalidating the author's legitimate needs.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They communicated their needs, which are valid given their trauma, and the girlfriend is the one not respecting the agreement. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
