It was hell and as a result I don\u2019t drink at all and don\u2019t like being around drunk people.  \n\nWhen I started dating my girlfriend I knew that she drank and discussed my issues with it.  I just asked her that she doesn\u2019t drink around me.  It worked out fine, she was great about not even drunk dialing me, a problem I had with my ex girlfriend.  \n\nWhen we started discussing moving in I was very apprehensive about it.  I asked her if she could really handle not drinking at all in our home and she was adamant that it was no big deal.  That if she wanted to drink she could just spend that night at a friends and that she really didn\u2019t drink that often anyways so it wouldn\u2019t be a problem.  \n\nThe first few months that\u2019s exactly what happened.  Since then though there have been times that she\u2019s come home obviously drunk and just lying about it to me.  I\u2019ve talked her about it to mixed reactions.  Sometimes she will apologize profusely and promise not to let it happen again.   Other times it becomes an argument about how I\u2019m projecting my mother\u2019s problem on our situation.  That she\u2019s not an alcoholic or abusive.  Which is true, but it\u2019s not really about her being abusive, it\u2019s that being around drunk people drudges up a lot of painful memories for me.  She just brushed that off though.  \n\nAfter this last time it happened she\u2019s outright fighting me on the issue.   She says this is her home too and we\u2019re both adults.   That I need to get therapy instead of trying to control her.  We had a clear agreement before we moved in though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's girlfriend drinking despite the author's request not to. The author has a history of an abusive alcoholic mother, so they're very sensitive to being around drunk people. They discussed this with their girlfriend before moving in, and she agreed not to drink at home. However, she's been coming home drunk and lying about it. Now she's arguing that the author is projecting and that they should get therapy instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is about their trauma and setting boundaries to protect their mental health. They made their needs clear, and the girlfriend agreed. But the girlfriend is now breaking that agreement, which is causing conflict. The author is trying to communicate their feelings, but the girlfriend is dismissing them, which is hurtful.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's side is that she's an adult and should have the right to drink if she wants, even in their shared home. She might feel that the author is being controlling or using their past to limit her autonomy. The author's request isn't about her being an alcoholic but about their own anxiety. However, the girlfriend's actions are violating the initial agreement, which the author felt was important.\n\nIn relationships, communication and mutual respect are key. The author had a valid reason for their request and discussed it beforehand. The girlfriend agreed but isn't following through, which could be seen as inconsiderate. The author is trying to address the issue, but the girlfriend is defensive, which might indicate a lack of empathy towards the author's feelings. The author isn't asking the girlfriend to change her habits entirely but to respect their home environment. \n\nHowever, the author also needs to consider whether their request is reasonable. The girlfriend isn't an alcoholic, so expecting her to completely abstain might be a stretch, but if they had an agreement, breaking it is an issue. The author's need for a safe space is important, especially given their history. The girlfriend's response of pushing back and suggesting therapy might come off as dismissive of the author's legitimate trauma.\n\nIn this case, the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries based on their past. The girlfriend's actions are violating the agreed-upon terms, which is problematic. The key point is that both parties need to respect each other's needs, but the girlfriend isn't honoring the initial agreement, leading to conflict. The author's stance is about their mental health and past, which is valid. The girlfriend's refusal to adhere to their agreement shows a lack of consideration. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
