It was hell and as a result I don\u2019t drink at all and don\u2019t like being around drunk people.  \n\nWhen I started dating my girlfriend I knew that she drank and discussed my issues with it.  I just asked her that she doesn\u2019t drink around me.  It worked out fine, she was great about not even drunk dialing me, a problem I had with my ex girlfriend.  \n\nWhen we started discussing moving in I was very apprehensive about it.  I asked her if she could really handle not drinking at all in our home and she was adamant that it was no big deal.  That if she wanted to drink she could just spend that night at a friends and that she really didn\u2019t drink that often anyways so it wouldn\u2019t be a problem.  \n\nThe first few months that\u2019s exactly what happened.  Since then though there have been times that she\u2019s come home obviously drunk and just lying about it to me.  I\u2019ve talked her about it to mixed reactions.  Sometimes she will apologize profusely and promise not to let it happen again.   Other times it becomes an argument about how I\u2019m projecting my mother\u2019s problem on our situation.  That she\u2019s not an alcoholic or abusive.  Which is true, but it\u2019s not really about her being abusive, it\u2019s that being around drunk people drudges up a lot of painful memories for me.  She just brushed that off though.  \n\nAfter this last time it happened she\u2019s outright fighting me on the issue.   She says this is her home too and we\u2019re both adults.   That I need to get therapy instead of trying to control her.  We had a clear agreement before we moved in though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a guy who has a traumatic past with an abusive alcoholic mother. Because of that, he doesn't drink and doesn't like being around drunk people. He asked his girlfriend not to drink around him when they started dating, and she agreed. When they moved in together, he asked her to not drink in their home, and she said that's fine, she could just go to a friend's if she wanted. But now she's come home drunk and lied about it, leading to arguments.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has valid reasons rooted in his trauma. He communicated his needs upfront, and the girlfriend agreed. However, the girlfriend is now breaking that agreement, and when confronted, she's defensive and accusing him of projecting his mother's issues. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that the author is overstepping, especially since she's an adult and the home is shared. But the problem is that the author isn't just asking her not to drink in general, but specifically not in their home. The initial agreement was clear, so her breaking that could be a breach of trust. \n\nAlso, the author's mental health is a factor. Being around drunk people triggers his trauma, so this isn't just a personal preference but a health issue. The girlfriend's actions are causing him distress, and she's not taking his feelings into account, even going as far as to dismiss his past experiences. \n\nBut maybe the author could have handled it differently? Like, perhaps setting clearer boundaries or involving a therapist together. However, the key point is that they had an agreement, and the girlfriend is not honoring it. The author is trying to protect his mental health based on a prior agreement, so that seems reasonable. \n\nThe girlfriend's argument that it's her home too might not take into account that they had an understanding before moving in. If they can't respect each other's boundaries, that could be a problem in the relationship. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author is not in the wrong. He communicated his needs, and the girlfriend is not respecting the agreed-upon boundaries. The answer should be B.\n"
