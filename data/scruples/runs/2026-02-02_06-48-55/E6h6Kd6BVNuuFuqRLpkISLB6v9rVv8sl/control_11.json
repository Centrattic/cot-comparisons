It was hell and as a result I don\u2019t drink at all and don\u2019t like being around drunk people.  \n\nWhen I started dating my girlfriend I knew that she drank and discussed my issues with it.  I just asked her that she doesn\u2019t drink around me.  It worked out fine, she was great about not even drunk dialing me, a problem I had with my ex girlfriend.  \n\nWhen we started discussing moving in I was very apprehensive about it.  I asked her if she could really handle not drinking at all in our home and she was adamant that it was no big deal.  That if she wanted to drink she could just spend that night at a friends and that she really didn\u2019t drink that often anyways so it wouldn\u2019t be a problem.  \n\nThe first few months that\u2019s exactly what happened.  Since then though there have been times that she\u2019s come home obviously drunk and just lying about it to me.  I\u2019ve talked her about it to mixed reactions.  Sometimes she will apologize profusely and promise not to let it happen again.   Other times it becomes an argument about how I\u2019m projecting my mother\u2019s problem on our situation.  That she\u2019s not an alcoholic or abusive.  Which is true, but it\u2019s not really about her being abusive, it\u2019s that being around drunk people drudges up a lot of painful memories for me.  She just brushed that off though.  \n\nAfter this last time it happened she\u2019s outright fighting me on the issue.   She says this is her home too and we\u2019re both adults.   That I need to get therapy instead of trying to control her.  We had a clear agreement before we moved in though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's girlfriend drinking despite previous agreements to avoid it because of the author's traumatic past with an alcoholic mother.\n\nFirst, the author has valid reasons rooted in their personal trauma. They've been open about their discomfort with alcohol, which is a legitimate issue. The key point here is that they communicated their boundaries upfront. The girlfriend agreed not to drink around them, especially when they started cohabiting. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend started coming home drunk and lying about it. The author confronts her, but she dismisses their concerns and argues that it's about projecting past issues. The author's main issue isn't about control but about their mental health and well-being. \n\nThe girlfriend's actions are violating the mutual agreement they had. While the girlfriend might not be an alcoholic, the author's request is about respecting their boundaries. The girlfriend's response of suggesting therapy instead of addressing the agreement could be seen as invalidating the author's feelings. \n\nThe core issue here is about respecting agreed-upon boundaries in a relationship. The author isn't trying to control but to maintain a safe environment. The girlfriend breaking the agreement and dismissing the author's feelings makes her actions problematic. Therefore, the author is justified in their stance. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
