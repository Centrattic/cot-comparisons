It was hell and as a result I don\u2019t drink at all and don\u2019t like being around drunk people.  \n\nWhen I started dating my girlfriend I knew that she drank and discussed my issues with it.  I just asked her that she doesn\u2019t drink around me.  It worked out fine, she was great about not even drunk dialing me, a problem I had with my ex girlfriend.  \n\nWhen we started discussing moving in I was very apprehensive about it.  I asked her if she could really handle not drinking at all in our home and she was adamant that it was no big deal.  That if she wanted to drink she could just spend that night at a friends and that she really didn\u2019t drink that often anyways so it wouldn\u2019t be a problem.  \n\nThe first few months that\u2019s exactly what happened.  Since then though there have been times that she\u2019s come home obviously drunk and just lying about it to me.  I\u2019ve talked her about it to mixed reactions.  Sometimes she will apologize profusely and promise not to let it happen again.   Other times it becomes an argument about how I\u2019m projecting my mother\u2019s problem on our situation.  That she\u2019s not an alcoholic or abusive.  Which is true, but it\u2019s not really about her being abusive, it\u2019s that being around drunk people drudges up a lot of painful memories for me.  She just brushed that off though.  \n\nAfter this last time it happened she\u2019s outright fighting me on the issue.   She says this is her home too and we\u2019re both adults.   That I need to get therapy instead of trying to control her.  We had a clear agreement before we moved in though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in a situation where they asked their girlfriend not to drink at home. The author has a history of an abusive alcoholic mother, which makes them uncomfortable around alcohol. They discussed this with their girlfriend before moving in, and she agreed not to drink there. However, she started coming home drunk and lying, leading to conflicts.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They have valid trauma from their past, which affects their current relationship. Setting boundaries is important, especially after trauma. The author communicated their needs clearly and the girlfriend initially respected that. But now she's breaking the agreement, which is causing distress.\n\nThen the girlfriend's side: she might feel her autonomy is being restricted. The author is asking her to change her behavior, which can be a tough ask. However, the author had prior agreement, so there's an expectation of mutual respect. The girlfriend's response\u2014arguing that it's her home and suggesting therapy\u2014might indicate a lack of empathy for the author's feelings.\n\nThe key points are the initial agreement, the girlfriend's actions violating that agreement, and the emotional impact on the author. The author isn't controlling; they're setting boundaries based on their trauma. The girlfriend's behavior is the issue here. The argument that the author is projecting might be a defense mechanism from the girlfriend to avoid addressing the real problem.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They have a right to their boundaries, especially given their history. The girlfriend isn't respecting the agreed-upon terms, which is the root of the problem. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
