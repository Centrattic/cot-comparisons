It was hell and as a result I don\u2019t drink at all and don\u2019t like being around drunk people.  \n\nWhen I started dating my girlfriend I knew that she drank and discussed my issues with it.  I just asked her that she doesn\u2019t drink around me.  It worked out fine, she was great about not even drunk dialing me, a problem I had with my ex girlfriend.  \n\nWhen we started discussing moving in I was very apprehensive about it.  I asked her if she could really handle not drinking at all in our home and she was adamant that it was no big deal.  That if she wanted to drink she could just spend that night at a friends and that she really didn\u2019t drink that often anyways so it wouldn\u2019t be a problem.  \n\nThe first few months that\u2019s exactly what happened.  Since then though there have been times that she\u2019s come home obviously drunk and just lying about it to me.  I\u2019ve talked her about it to mixed reactions.  Sometimes she will apologize profusely and promise not to let it happen again.   Other times it becomes an argument about how I\u2019m projecting my mother\u2019s problem on our situation.  That she\u2019s not an alcoholic or abusive.  Which is true, but it\u2019s not really about her being abusive, it\u2019s that being around drunk people drudges up a lot of painful memories for me.  She just brushed that off though.  \n\nAfter this last time it happened she\u2019s outright fighting me on the issue.   She says this is her home too and we\u2019re both adults.   That I need to get therapy instead of trying to control her.  We had a clear agreement before we moved in though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's anxiety about their girlfriend drinking after they've agreed she wouldn't drink at home. The author has a history with an abusive alcoholic mother, so being around drunk people triggers them. They discussed this with their girlfriend before moving in, and she agreed to not drink at home. However, she started coming home drunk and lying about it. The author confronts her, but she dismisses their concerns and says it's about projection and that she's an adult.\n\nFirst, I need to consider boundaries and prior agreements. The couple had an agreement before moving in, so the author's request isn't out of nowhere. The author has legitimate emotional triggers from their past, which is a valid reason to set boundaries. However, the girlfriend is now breaking that agreement, which is a problem. The key here is whether the author's request is reasonable and if the girlfriend is respecting their boundaries. \n\nThe author isn't asking for the girlfriend to quit drinking entirely but to not drink at home. They also mention that she's lying and coming home drunk, which is a violation of the agreement. The girlfriend's response is dismissive, suggesting the author should seek therapy instead of addressing the issue. That could indicate a lack of empathy or understanding. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author is projecting their mother's abuse onto a healthy relationship, especially since the girlfriend isn't an alcoholic or abusive. But the author's main issue is the emotional distress caused by being around drunk people, not the girlfriend's behavior outside the home. Since the agreement was made, the author has the right to expect it to be honored. \n\nThe girlfriend's actions (breaking the agreement, lying, being defensive) seem to be the main issue here. The author isn't in the wrong for standing by their needs. However, it's also important to consider communication and whether the author has been assertive but respectful. The author has discussed it, but the girlfriend isn't cooperating, which shifts responsibility to her. \n\nSo, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they had a prior agreement, valid reasons tied to trauma, and the GF isn't respecting that. The problem lies with her breaking the agreement and dismissing his feelings.\n"
