It was hell and as a result I don\u2019t drink at all and don\u2019t like being around drunk people.  \n\nWhen I started dating my girlfriend I knew that she drank and discussed my issues with it.  I just asked her that she doesn\u2019t drink around me.  It worked out fine, she was great about not even drunk dialing me, a problem I had with my ex girlfriend.  \n\nWhen we started discussing moving in I was very apprehensive about it.  I asked her if she could really handle not drinking at all in our home and she was adamant that it was no big deal.  That if she wanted to drink she could just spend that night at a friends and that she really didn\u2019t drink that often anyways so it wouldn\u2019t be a problem.  \n\nThe first few months that\u2019s exactly what happened.  Since then though there have been times that she\u2019s come home obviously drunk and just lying about it to me.  I\u2019ve talked her about it to mixed reactions.  Sometimes she will apologize profusely and promise not to let it happen again.   Other times it becomes an argument about how I\u2019m projecting my mother\u2019s problem on our situation.  That she\u2019s not an alcoholic or abusive.  Which is true, but it\u2019s not really about her being abusive, it\u2019s that being around drunk people drudges up a lot of painful memories for me.  She just brushed that off though.  \n\nAfter this last time it happened she\u2019s outright fighting me on the issue.   She says this is her home too and we\u2019re both adults.   That I need to get therapy instead of trying to control her.  We had a clear agreement before we moved in though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's history with an abusive alcoholic mother, leading them to not drink and avoid being around drunk people. They discussed this with their girlfriend before moving in together and set a boundary that she doesn't drink around them. Initially, she followed the agreement, but now she's coming home drunk and lying about it. The author confronts her, but she responds by accusing them of projecting and not needing to control her, suggesting therapy instead.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my perspective. So I need to analyze the situation carefully. The author has valid personal reasons rooted in trauma. They communicated their boundary beforehand, and the girlfriend agreed. However, the girlfriend is now violating that agreement. The author is trying to address the issue, but the girlfriend is dismissive and even hostile. \n\nIs the author wrong for setting this boundary? Boundaries are essential in relationships, especially when they relate to mental health and past trauma. The girlfriend's behavior is breaking an agreement they had. The author isn't trying to control her in a general sense; they're asking her to respect a specific boundary. The girlfriend's response seems to be invalidating the author's feelings and trauma, which isn't healthy. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend is an adult and has her own autonomy. If she doesn't have an alcohol problem, maybe the author's restrictions are too controlling. But the key here is the prior agreement. If she agreed to not drink at home, then breaking that agreement is on her. The author isn't forbidding her from drinking entirely, just in their shared home. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for asking her to respect the boundary they discussed. The girlfriend is the one not following through, and her defensiveness is unhelpful. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
