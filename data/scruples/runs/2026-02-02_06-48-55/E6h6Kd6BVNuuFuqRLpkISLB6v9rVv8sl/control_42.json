It was hell and as a result I don\u2019t drink at all and don\u2019t like being around drunk people.  \n\nWhen I started dating my girlfriend I knew that she drank and discussed my issues with it.  I just asked her that she doesn\u2019t drink around me.  It worked out fine, she was great about not even drunk dialing me, a problem I had with my ex girlfriend.  \n\nWhen we started discussing moving in I was very apprehensive about it.  I asked her if she could really handle not drinking at all in our home and she was adamant that it was no big deal.  That if she wanted to drink she could just spend that night at a friends and that she really didn\u2019t drink that often anyways so it wouldn\u2019t be a problem.  \n\nThe first few months that\u2019s exactly what happened.  Since then though there have been times that she\u2019s come home obviously drunk and just lying about it to me.  I\u2019ve talked her about it to mixed reactions.  Sometimes she will apologize profusely and promise not to let it happen again.   Other times it becomes an argument about how I\u2019m projecting my mother\u2019s problem on our situation.  That she\u2019s not an alcoholic or abusive.  Which is true, but it\u2019s not really about her being abusive, it\u2019s that being around drunk people drudges up a lot of painful memories for me.  She just brushed that off though.  \n\nAfter this last time it happened she\u2019s outright fighting me on the issue.   She says this is her home too and we\u2019re both adults.   That I need to get therapy instead of trying to control her.  We had a clear agreement before we moved in though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The person (the author) grew up with an abusive alcoholic mother and doesn't drink. They asked their girlfriend not to drink around them, and when they moved in together, the author wanted the girlfriend to avoid drinking at home. The girlfriend agreed initially but later started coming home drunk and lying about it. Now she's arguing that the author is being controlling and that he should get therapy instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They have a valid history of trauma from their mother's alcoholism, which makes them uncomfortable around drunk people. They communicated their needs clearly before moving in, and the girlfriend initially respected that. However, the girlfriend is now breaking the agreement and dismissing the author's feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend is an adult and might feel her autonomy is being restricted. The author's request is about setting boundaries to protect their mental health, which is reasonable. The girlfriend's behavior of lying and coming home drunk violates that boundary. The author isn't asking the girlfriend to stop drinking entirely but to avoid it in their home to respect the author's needs. The girlfriend's response of calling the author controlling and suggesting therapy could be a deflection from the actual issue.\n\nThe key points here are mutual respect and communication. The author set clear boundaries upfront, and the girlfriend agreed. The problem arises when the girlfriend doesn't follow through, leading to conflict. The author isn't in the wrong for establishing their limits based on their past trauma. The girlfriend's actions are the ones that breach the agreement. The author's concern isn't about controlling the girlfriend's drinking but about their own well-being. The girlfriend's arguments about projection might stem from not understanding the author's trauma and not taking it seriously.\n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they had a valid reason based on their history and communicated their needs clearly. The girlfriend is the one not respecting the agreed-upon boundaries.\n"
