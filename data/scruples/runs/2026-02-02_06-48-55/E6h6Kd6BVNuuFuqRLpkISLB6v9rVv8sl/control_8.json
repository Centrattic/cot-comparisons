It was hell and as a result I don\u2019t drink at all and don\u2019t like being around drunk people.  \n\nWhen I started dating my girlfriend I knew that she drank and discussed my issues with it.  I just asked her that she doesn\u2019t drink around me.  It worked out fine, she was great about not even drunk dialing me, a problem I had with my ex girlfriend.  \n\nWhen we started discussing moving in I was very apprehensive about it.  I asked her if she could really handle not drinking at all in our home and she was adamant that it was no big deal.  That if she wanted to drink she could just spend that night at a friends and that she really didn\u2019t drink that often anyways so it wouldn\u2019t be a problem.  \n\nThe first few months that\u2019s exactly what happened.  Since then though there have been times that she\u2019s come home obviously drunk and just lying about it to me.  I\u2019ve talked her about it to mixed reactions.  Sometimes she will apologize profusely and promise not to let it happen again.   Other times it becomes an argument about how I\u2019m projecting my mother\u2019s problem on our situation.  That she\u2019s not an alcoholic or abusive.  Which is true, but it\u2019s not really about her being abusive, it\u2019s that being around drunk people drudges up a lot of painful memories for me.  She just brushed that off though.  \n\nAfter this last time it happened she\u2019s outright fighting me on the issue.   She says this is her home too and we\u2019re both adults.   That I need to get therapy instead of trying to control her.  We had a clear agreement before we moved in though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking their girlfriend not to drink. The situation involves the author's past with an abusive alcoholic mother, leading them to avoid drinking and being around drunk people. The girlfriend initially respected the request but later started drinking around the author, lying about it, and now there's conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the boundaries they set. The author clearly communicated their issues with drinking before moving in, and the girlfriend agreed to not drink at home. If she's now breaking that agreement, the author has a valid reason to be upset. Their trauma is real, and being around drunk people triggers them. The girlfriend's behavior is violating the agreed-upon boundary, which could strain the relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that the author is being controlling or projecting their past onto her. She's an adult and might feel her autonomy is being restricted. However, the author isn't asking her to stop drinking entirely, just not in their home. The lies about drinking add another layer of trust issues.\n\nThe key points are: prior agreement, the author's mental health and trauma, and the girlfriend's actions violating that agreement. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries based on their experiences. The girlfriend's rejection of the author's feelings and insistence that it's about control suggests she's not respecting those boundaries. Therapy might help both, but the author isn't the one violating the agreement. So the answer is B (No).\n"
