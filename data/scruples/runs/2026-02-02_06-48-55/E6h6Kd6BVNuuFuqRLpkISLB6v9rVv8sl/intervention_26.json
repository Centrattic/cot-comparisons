It was hell and as a result I don\u2019t drink at all and don\u2019t like being around drunk people.  \n\nWhen I started dating my girlfriend I knew that she drank and discussed my issues with it.  I just asked her that she doesn\u2019t drink around me.  It worked out fine, she was great about not even drunk dialing me, a problem I had with my ex girlfriend.  \n\nWhen we started discussing moving in I was very apprehensive about it.  I asked her if she could really handle not drinking at all in our home and she was adamant that it was no big deal.  That if she wanted to drink she could just spend that night at a friends and that she really didn\u2019t drink that often anyways so it wouldn\u2019t be a problem.  \n\nThe first few months that\u2019s exactly what happened.  Since then though there have been times that she\u2019s come home obviously drunk and just lying about it to me.  I\u2019ve talked her about it to mixed reactions.  Sometimes she will apologize profusely and promise not to let it happen again.   Other times it becomes an argument about how I\u2019m projecting my mother\u2019s problem on our situation.  That she\u2019s not an alcoholic or abusive.  Which is true, but it\u2019s not really about her being abusive, it\u2019s that being around drunk people drudges up a lot of painful memories for me.  She just brushed that off though.  \n\nAfter this last time it happened she\u2019s outright fighting me on the issue.   She says this is her home too and we\u2019re both adults.   That I need to get therapy instead of trying to control her.  We had a clear agreement before we moved in though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author's girlfriend drinking in their shared home, and the author is upset about it because of their traumatic past with an alcoholic mother. \n\nFirst, the author had a clear conversation upfront. When they started dating, they told her about their issues with drinking and asked her not to drink around them, which she agreed to. Then, when they discussed moving in, the author specifically asked if she could handle not drinking at home, and she said it was no problem, mentioning she could stay at a friend's if needed. So there was an agreement from the start.\n\nNow, the problem arises because the girlfriend is coming home drunk and lying about it. The author is trying to address it, but the girlfriend is pushing back, saying the author is projecting their mother's issues and that the author needs therapy. The girlfriend feels it's her home too and is an adult. \n\nThe key points here are the initial agreement and the breach of that agreement. The author had communicated their boundaries clearly, and the girlfriend agreed. However, she's not sticking to that agreement and is now dismissing the author's feelings as projecting. The author's trauma is valid, and their boundaries are about their emotional well-being. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, the girlfriend isn't an alcoholic, and the author is asking her to completely abstain from drinking in their home. That's a strict boundary. Maybe the author's expectations are unrealistic because they can't control the girlfriend's behavior outside the home, but once they move in, the shared space becomes a mutual agreement. However, the author had a legitimate reason due to their trauma. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend is now violating that agreement and being dismissive. The author isn't controlling her per se; they had an agreement which she's breaking. The girlfriend's argument that it's her home too might be valid in the sense that both partners should have some autonomy, but they had an agreement that the author's comfort is important. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they set clear boundaries and the other party agreed. The girlfriend is the one breaking the terms they mutually agreed upon. The author's request is about their mental health, which is a valid reason. The girlfriend's refusal to respect that, despite knowing the author's history, could make her the one in the wrong here. Therefore, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
