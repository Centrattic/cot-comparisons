It was hell and as a result I don\u2019t drink at all and don\u2019t like being around drunk people.  \n\nWhen I started dating my girlfriend I knew that she drank and discussed my issues with it.  I just asked her that she doesn\u2019t drink around me.  It worked out fine, she was great about not even drunk dialing me, a problem I had with my ex girlfriend.  \n\nWhen we started discussing moving in I was very apprehensive about it.  I asked her if she could really handle not drinking at all in our home and she was adamant that it was no big deal.  That if she wanted to drink she could just spend that night at a friends and that she really didn\u2019t drink that often anyways so it wouldn\u2019t be a problem.  \n\nThe first few months that\u2019s exactly what happened.  Since then though there have been times that she\u2019s come home obviously drunk and just lying about it to me.  I\u2019ve talked her about it to mixed reactions.  Sometimes she will apologize profusely and promise not to let it happen again.   Other times it becomes an argument about how I\u2019m projecting my mother\u2019s problem on our situation.  That she\u2019s not an alcoholic or abusive.  Which is true, but it\u2019s not really about her being abusive, it\u2019s that being around drunk people drudges up a lot of painful memories for me.  She just brushed that off though.  \n\nAfter this last time it happened she\u2019s outright fighting me on the issue.   She says this is her home too and we\u2019re both adults.   That I need to get therapy instead of trying to control her.  We had a clear agreement before we moved in though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for asking their girlfriend not to drink around them. The author has a history of an abusive alcoholic mother, which makes them uncomfortable around alcohol. They discussed this with their girlfriend before moving in, and she agreed not to drink at home. However, she's been coming home drunk and lying, leading to arguments. The author feels they're not being respected and that the drinking triggers bad memories.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the boundaries and agreements made in the relationship. The author communicated their needs clearly before moving in, and the girlfriend initially respected that. The fact that she started breaking the agreement after a while suggests a possible issue with her honoring the mutual understanding. The author's request is rooted in their trauma, which is a valid reason for setting boundaries, even if the girlfriend isn't an alcoholic. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend argues that it's her home too and that the author is projecting their past onto her. She might feel that her autonomy is being restricted. However, agreements made before moving in are important for a healthy relationship. If one party is consistently disregarding the agreed-upon boundaries, it can cause significant stress and harm. The author is not trying to control her life outside the home, just within their shared space. \n\nThe fact that the author isn't drinking and is avoiding situations that trigger them is their choice, and they have the right to a safe environment. The girlfriend's refusal to honor the agreement, especially after repeated discussions and apologies, seems to be a breach of trust. The author isn't in the wrong for standing by their needs and asking for respect. The girlfriend's behavior is causing the conflict here, not the author's request. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries based on their experiences and expecting their partner to honor them. The girlfriend isn't an alcoholic, but the author's mental health and comfort should be respected. The problem arises when the girlfriend doesn't adhere to the agreed terms. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
