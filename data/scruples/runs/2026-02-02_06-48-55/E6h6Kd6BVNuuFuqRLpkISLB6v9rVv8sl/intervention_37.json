It was hell and as a result I don\u2019t drink at all and don\u2019t like being around drunk people.  \n\nWhen I started dating my girlfriend I knew that she drank and discussed my issues with it.  I just asked her that she doesn\u2019t drink around me.  It worked out fine, she was great about not even drunk dialing me, a problem I had with my ex girlfriend.  \n\nWhen we started discussing moving in I was very apprehensive about it.  I asked her if she could really handle not drinking at all in our home and she was adamant that it was no big deal.  That if she wanted to drink she could just spend that night at a friends and that she really didn\u2019t drink that often anyways so it wouldn\u2019t be a problem.  \n\nThe first few months that\u2019s exactly what happened.  Since then though there have been times that she\u2019s come home obviously drunk and just lying about it to me.  I\u2019ve talked her about it to mixed reactions.  Sometimes she will apologize profusely and promise not to let it happen again.   Other times it becomes an argument about how I\u2019m projecting my mother\u2019s problem on our situation.  That she\u2019s not an alcoholic or abusive.  Which is true, but it\u2019s not really about her being abusive, it\u2019s that being around drunk people drudges up a lot of painful memories for me.  She just brushed that off though.  \n\nAfter this last time it happened she\u2019s outright fighting me on the issue.   She says this is her home too and we\u2019re both adults.   That I need to get therapy instead of trying to control her.  We had a clear agreement before we moved in though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's girlfriend drinking despite prior agreements.\n\nFirst, the author has a history of an abusive alcoholic mother, which makes them uncomfortable around alcohol. They discussed this with their girlfriend before moving in and reached an agreement that she wouldn't drink at home. Initially, she respected that, but now she's coming home drunk and lying about it, leading to arguments.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to evaluate both sides. The author set clear boundaries based on their trauma and got a mutual agreement. The girlfriend is now breaking those terms, which the author is trying to address. The girlfriend is defending her right to drink, even though they had an agreement. \n\nIs the author wrong? They're not forcing her to quit drinking entirely, just in their shared home. They're addressing their valid emotional needs. The girlfriend is not respecting the prior agreement. The author is trying to maintain a safe space for themselves. The girlfriend's reaction dismisses the author's feelings and the agreed-upon boundaries. \n\nThe key points are the prior agreement and the violation of that. The author isn't controlling; they're upholding a mutual understanding. The girlfriend is the one changing her behavior without considering the impact. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
