Now I'll just call her Sofia. My my wife Sofia is beautiful, but most of all, she has a wonderful personality. She is reserved, incredibly kind hearted and mentally strong. She had all the qualities to make a great mother. (we're planning on trying for kids soon). She's Mexican and was born/raised there, and she is quite religious Cahtolic.\n\nNow I'm also Catholic as well, I come from an Irish American Cahtolic background. However it's more of a ''religious in name only'' sort of thing, I somewhat vaguely believe in a deity of some sorts but not really a strong belief in the scripture like my parents. \n\nAnyway, when I first started dating her, the first thing my mates said was literally ''Dude this woman is wifey material''. It became a bit of a running joke, ''wifey material''. \n\nShe seemed like the PERFECT woman and I was a bit persistant when I first met her but eventually she agreed to go on a date from me, from then on it was history because we did have a lot in common. So now we married but one of the reasons I married her, aside from her personality, was that she was a virgin. She didn't sleep around whatsoever, she held out for the ''right guy'' and that guy was me. \n\nSo when I was talking to my female friend (30F) I said that one of the reasons I wanted to marry her was because of her personality AND the fact that she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. I thought this was an okay view to hold but she called me a ''Fucking asshole'' because she pointed out that I slept around in my youth. \n\nIt's true, when I was in my early 20's, I did a lot of sleeping around and hookup culture. And I could have seen myself marrying those girls if I was left with no choice, but they were never my IDEAL choices for partners, so I feel like Sofia was a god send in that regard. My friend (20F) still said I was being a hypocrite however what right does she have to criticize my dating choices? AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for feeling that he married his wife because she didn't sleep around, even though he had a history of doing so. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author married Sofia because he saw her as \"wifey material\" and specifically because she was a virgin. He mentions that his friends joked about her being perfect and that he held onto her for being virtuous. However, when he shared this with a female friend, she criticized him as an asshole for being hypocritical because he had a history of sleeping around.\n\nThe question here is about hypocrisy. The author is judging his wife's past (being a virgin) while having his own past of sleeping around. The friend's point is that he's being inconsistent. But does that make him wrong? \n\nI think the user is right in their initial thought that the author is in the wrong. Hypocrisy often comes into play when someone doesn't hold themselves to the same standards they hold others. The author's actions are contradictory. He values monogamy and chastity in a partner but didn't practice it himself. This could lead to problems in the marriage if Sofia feels judged for her past, though the author doesn't mention her reaction. \n\nHowever, the author argues that his past choices were different, and he's happy now. But the issue is about the judgment and double standard. Even if his intentions were good, the hypocrisy is there. The friend's criticism is valid because it's about the inconsistency. So, the answer would be A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
