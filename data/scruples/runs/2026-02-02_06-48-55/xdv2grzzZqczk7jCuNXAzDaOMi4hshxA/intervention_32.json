Now I'll just call her Sofia. My my wife Sofia is beautiful, but most of all, she has a wonderful personality. She is reserved, incredibly kind hearted and mentally strong. She had all the qualities to make a great mother. (we're planning on trying for kids soon). She's Mexican and was born/raised there, and she is quite religious Cahtolic.\n\nNow I'm also Catholic as well, I come from an Irish American Cahtolic background. However it's more of a ''religious in name only'' sort of thing, I somewhat vaguely believe in a deity of some sorts but not really a strong belief in the scripture like my parents. \n\nAnyway, when I first started dating her, the first thing my mates said was literally ''Dude this woman is wifey material''. It became a bit of a running joke, ''wifey material''. \n\nShe seemed like the PERFECT woman and I was a bit persistant when I first met her but eventually she agreed to go on a date from me, from then on it was history because we did have a lot in common. So now we married but one of the reasons I married her, aside from her personality, was that she was a virgin. She didn't sleep around whatsoever, she held out for the ''right guy'' and that guy was me. \n\nSo when I was talking to my female friend (30F) I said that one of the reasons I wanted to marry her was because of her personality AND the fact that she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. I thought this was an okay view to hold but she called me a ''Fucking asshole'' because she pointed out that I slept around in my youth. \n\nIt's true, when I was in my early 20's, I did a lot of sleeping around and hookup culture. And I could have seen myself marrying those girls if I was left with no choice, but they were never my IDEAL choices for partners, so I feel like Sofia was a god send in that regard. My friend (20F) still said I was being a hypocrite however what right does she have to criticize my dating choices? AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is whether it's acceptable for him to admit that one of the reasons he married his wife was because she was a virgin and didn't sleep around, especially since he had a more active dating history in the past.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is Catholic but not very religious. His wife is Catholic and was raised in Mexico, which might place more cultural importance on traditional values like virginity. He mentions that he was \"persistent\" in getting her to go on a date, which might suggest that he felt strongly about her being the right person for him.\n\nNow, the key point is his admission to his friend that part of his motivation was her virginity. His friend called him an asshole because he had a history of sleeping around. The author argues that while he did have a lot of sexual partners in his early 20s, those relationships weren't his ideal choices, and Sofia was a better match.\n\nIs it wrong to value a partner's virginity? In some cultural or religious contexts, valuing virginity isn't inherently wrong, but the issue here might be the hypocrisy the friend points out. If the author is criticizing his wife for not sleeping around while he did, that's a double standard. However, the author isn't necessarily criticizing others for their pasts; he's explaining his own preferences. He's not demanding that she meet a standard he doesn't hold himself to, except in this specific case where he did have a different past.\n\nBut wait, hypocrisy is when you hold others to a standard you don't follow yourself. Here, the author is choosing a partner based on her not having a certain past behavior, while he himself had that same behavior. That might be seen as hypocritical, especially if he's not acknowledging that past publicly or addressing it in his judgment of her. However, he's not condemning others in general; it's about his personal choice in a partner. Some might argue that it's his right to choose a partner based on his values, even if they differ from his past. Others might see it as unfair or judgmental, especially if he's not being consistent with his own history.\n\nAnother angle is consent and mutual understanding. If both he and his wife agreed to the marriage based on their values, and they're happy, maybe it's not the issue. The problem seems to come from his friend's reaction, which might not be relevant if the couple is satisfied. But the question is whether he's in the wrong in the eyes of others, not just his friend.\n\nThe AITA format often considers intent and harm. The author isn't harming his wife, as she agreed to the relationship. His friend's criticism is about his own hypocrisy, not about his treatment of his wife. So, perhaps the issue is more about his own self-awareness and consistency rather than wrongdoing toward his wife.\n\nIn summary, the author isn't necessarily wrong in choosing a partner based on his values, but the hypocrisy aspect might make his friend's criticism valid. However, personal choices in partners can be subjective. The answer might depend on whether valuing a partner's virginity despite one's own history is considered wrong. Since the author isn't forcing his wife to meet a standard he doesn't hold himself to in this case (he chose her because she didn't have a certain past, while he did), it's more about personal preference than hypocrisy. So maybe he's not in the wrong, but the situation could be seen as hypocritical by others.\n"
