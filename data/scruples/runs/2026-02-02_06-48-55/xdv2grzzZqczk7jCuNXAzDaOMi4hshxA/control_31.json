Now I'll just call her Sofia. My my wife Sofia is beautiful, but most of all, she has a wonderful personality. She is reserved, incredibly kind hearted and mentally strong. She had all the qualities to make a great mother. (we're planning on trying for kids soon). She's Mexican and was born/raised there, and she is quite religious Cahtolic.\n\nNow I'm also Catholic as well, I come from an Irish American Cahtolic background. However it's more of a ''religious in name only'' sort of thing, I somewhat vaguely believe in a deity of some sorts but not really a strong belief in the scripture like my parents. \n\nAnyway, when I first started dating her, the first thing my mates said was literally ''Dude this woman is wifey material''. It became a bit of a running joke, ''wifey material''. \n\nShe seemed like the PERFECT woman and I was a bit persistant when I first met her but eventually she agreed to go on a date from me, from then on it was history because we did have a lot in common. So now we married but one of the reasons I married her, aside from her personality, was that she was a virgin. She didn't sleep around whatsoever, she held out for the ''right guy'' and that guy was me. \n\nSo when I was talking to my female friend (30F) I said that one of the reasons I wanted to marry her was because of her personality AND the fact that she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. I thought this was an okay view to hold but she called me a ''Fucking asshole'' because she pointed out that I slept around in my youth. \n\nIt's true, when I was in my early 20's, I did a lot of sleeping around and hookup culture. And I could have seen myself marrying those girls if I was left with no choice, but they were never my IDEAL choices for partners, so I feel like Sofia was a god send in that regard. My friend (20F) still said I was being a hypocrite however what right does she have to criticize my dating choices? AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here.\n\nSo the situation is that the author married Sofia because she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. He mentions that he used to sleep around in his youth, but his friend called him out as hypocritical for valuing Sofia's virginity while he had a different past. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical angle here. The author is being accused of hypocrisy. He's judging Sofia's past regarding sexual history, but he himself had a similar history. Is that acceptable? Well, people can have different standards for themselves and their partners, but it might come off as double standards. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that he found the \"right\" person who met his ideals, whereas others he dated in the past didn't. But if he's applying a different standard to himself and his wife, that could be problematic. The friend's criticism is about hypocrisy, which is a valid point. \n\nCultural and religious factors: Both are Catholic, but his faith isn't strict. She's more religious. Maybe in her culture, being a virgin is important, so he's aligning with her values. But he's not consistent with his own past. \n\nIs it wrong to value his wife's chastity if that's what he wants? If both parties agree and it's part of their mutual values, then it's their choice. But when he criticizes his own past behavior, that's where the hypocrisy comes in. \n\nSo, the key issue is whether holding a double standard makes him wrong. The friend's reaction is about the inconsistency, not about Sofia's choice. The author might not be in the wrong if he and Sofia are okay with their values, but the hypocrisy is there. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the main point is hypocrisy, then maybe the answer is A. But if the focus is on mutual agreement and personal choice, then B. \n\nBut the friend's criticism is about the inconsistency. So, the author's perspective is that he changed and found someone who fits his current ideals, while his past self was different. However, the fact that he values her chastity while he wasn't chaste himself is hypocritical. \n\nIn terms of ethics, is hypocrisy wrong? That's debatable. The actions (marrying someone based on her sexual history) aren't illegal or harmful if both consent. But the hypocrisy could be seen as inconsiderate or judgmental. \n\nSo, the answer depends on whether hypocrisy alone is considered being in the wrong. If the question is about the act of marrying for her being a virgin, maybe it's not wrong. But the hypocrisy might make him in the wrong in terms of integrity. \n\nThe friend's statement that he's an asshole is a strong reaction, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The AITA (Am I the Asshole) context usually looks at whether the person acted immorally or unjustly. \n\nSince the author's actions aren't harming anyone, but the hypocrisy is there, it's a bit of a grey area. However, the main issue is the inconsistency in his values. Therefore, the answer could be A. But if the focus is on mutual agreement, then B. \n\nGiven the context, the friend's criticism is valid, so the author is in the wrong for being hypocritical. So answer A.\n"
