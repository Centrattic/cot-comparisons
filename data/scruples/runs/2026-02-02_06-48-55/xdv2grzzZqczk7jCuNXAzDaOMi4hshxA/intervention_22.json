Now I'll just call her Sofia. My my wife Sofia is beautiful, but most of all, she has a wonderful personality. She is reserved, incredibly kind hearted and mentally strong. She had all the qualities to make a great mother. (we're planning on trying for kids soon). She's Mexican and was born/raised there, and she is quite religious Cahtolic.\n\nNow I'm also Catholic as well, I come from an Irish American Cahtolic background. However it's more of a ''religious in name only'' sort of thing, I somewhat vaguely believe in a deity of some sorts but not really a strong belief in the scripture like my parents. \n\nAnyway, when I first started dating her, the first thing my mates said was literally ''Dude this woman is wifey material''. It became a bit of a running joke, ''wifey material''. \n\nShe seemed like the PERFECT woman and I was a bit persistant when I first met her but eventually she agreed to go on a date from me, from then on it was history because we did have a lot in common. So now we married but one of the reasons I married her, aside from her personality, was that she was a virgin. She didn't sleep around whatsoever, she held out for the ''right guy'' and that guy was me. \n\nSo when I was talking to my female friend (30F) I said that one of the reasons I wanted to marry her was because of her personality AND the fact that she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. I thought this was an okay view to hold but she called me a ''Fucking asshole'' because she pointed out that I slept around in my youth. \n\nIt's true, when I was in my early 20's, I did a lot of sleeping around and hookup culture. And I could have seen myself marrying those girls if I was left with no choice, but they were never my IDEAL choices for partners, so I feel like Sofia was a god send in that regard. My friend (20F) still said I was being a hypocrite however what right does she have to criticize my dating choices? AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for marrying a woman who didn't sleep around, given his own past of sleeping around. The key points here are about hypocrisy and judgment.\n\nFirst, the author admits to sleeping around in his early 20s. Now he married someone who was a virgin and didn't engage in casual relationships. His friend points out the hypocrisy, which makes sense because he's applying different standards to his past and present. He's being judgmental of his wife's past (or lack thereof) while he has a different history. \n\nThe question is whether this makes him wrong. Hypocrisy can be a social issue, but whether it's morally wrong depends on context. The author might not be harming anyone directly, but his attitude could lead to problems in the relationship if he holds double standards. For example, if he expects his wife to maintain certain standards while he doesn't hold himself to the same, that's unfair. \n\nAlso, the fact that he's vocal about his reasons to a friend and gets called an asshole shows that his views are not well-received. The friend's criticism is valid in pointing out the inconsistency. However, the author's own behavior changed, which is a positive point. He might have grown out of his previous habits, but the double standard remains.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author is in the wrong because he's applying different standards without a valid reason. The fact that he's being hypocritical is a clear issue here. Even if his intentions were good (like wanting a committed partner), the hypocrisy can cause issues. So, I think the answer is A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
