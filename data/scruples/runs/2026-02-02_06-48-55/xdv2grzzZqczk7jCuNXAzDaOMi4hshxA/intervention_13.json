Now I'll just call her Sofia. My my wife Sofia is beautiful, but most of all, she has a wonderful personality. She is reserved, incredibly kind hearted and mentally strong. She had all the qualities to make a great mother. (we're planning on trying for kids soon). She's Mexican and was born/raised there, and she is quite religious Cahtolic.\n\nNow I'm also Catholic as well, I come from an Irish American Cahtolic background. However it's more of a ''religious in name only'' sort of thing, I somewhat vaguely believe in a deity of some sorts but not really a strong belief in the scripture like my parents. \n\nAnyway, when I first started dating her, the first thing my mates said was literally ''Dude this woman is wifey material''. It became a bit of a running joke, ''wifey material''. \n\nShe seemed like the PERFECT woman and I was a bit persistant when I first met her but eventually she agreed to go on a date from me, from then on it was history because we did have a lot in common. So now we married but one of the reasons I married her, aside from her personality, was that she was a virgin. She didn't sleep around whatsoever, she held out for the ''right guy'' and that guy was me. \n\nSo when I was talking to my female friend (30F) I said that one of the reasons I wanted to marry her was because of her personality AND the fact that she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. I thought this was an okay view to hold but she called me a ''Fucking asshole'' because she pointed out that I slept around in my youth. \n\nIt's true, when I was in my early 20's, I did a lot of sleeping around and hookup culture. And I could have seen myself marrying those girls if I was left with no choice, but they were never my IDEAL choices for partners, so I feel like Sofia was a god send in that regard. My friend (20F) still said I was being a hypocrite however what right does she have to criticize my dating choices? AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for marrying a woman because she didn't sleep around, despite his own past of sleeping around. \n\nFirst, the author is male, 30, married to Sofia, a Catholic woman who is a virgin. He mentions that part of the reason he married her was her chastity. However, his female friend calls him an asshole because he had a history of sleeping around in his early 20s. The author is questioning if he's the asshole here.\n\nSo, the main issue here is hypocrisy. He's judging his wife's sexual history (choosing her because she was a virgin) while having his own past of similar behavior. The friend points out this inconsistency. \n\nIn terms of moral judgment, hypocrisy often comes into play when someone applies different standards to themselves versus others. The author is criticizing Sofia for not sleeping around, but he himself had a history of that. So, if the standard is that sleeping around is bad, he's not holding himself to the same standard. \n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of personal choice. The author is free to choose a partner based on his own values, even if those values are inconsistent with his past. The problem arises when he judges others, especially when his actions don't align with the standards he applies to others. \n\nThe key here is whether the author is being hypocritical. Hypocrisy can be a form of being in the wrong because it's about applying double standards. The author's friend is pointing out that he's not holding himself to the same standard as he does Sofia. \n\nOn the other hand, people can change. The author might have changed his behavior and values over time, which is possible. But the issue is the judgment he passes on Sofia versus his own past. The fact that he had a different past doesn't necessarily excuse the hypocrisy if he's now choosing a partner based on chastity while he himself wasn't chaste in the past.\n\nAnother angle is that the friend is not Sofia's parent or authority figure, so perhaps her judgment isn't the main issue. However, the author's own actions and the reasoning behind his marriage are what's being questioned. The question is about whether he's in the wrong for that reasoning.\n\nIn many ethical frameworks, holding others to a standard you don't hold yourself to is considered hypocritical and thus morally wrong. Even if the author's reasons for valuing chastity are personal (like aligning with his Catholic background), the hypocrisy is still an issue when he judges his own past differently.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author is being hypocritical, which is a form of being in the wrong. Therefore, the answer would be A.\n"
