Now I'll just call her Sofia. My my wife Sofia is beautiful, but most of all, she has a wonderful personality. She is reserved, incredibly kind hearted and mentally strong. She had all the qualities to make a great mother. (we're planning on trying for kids soon). She's Mexican and was born/raised there, and she is quite religious Cahtolic.\n\nNow I'm also Catholic as well, I come from an Irish American Cahtolic background. However it's more of a ''religious in name only'' sort of thing, I somewhat vaguely believe in a deity of some sorts but not really a strong belief in the scripture like my parents. \n\nAnyway, when I first started dating her, the first thing my mates said was literally ''Dude this woman is wifey material''. It became a bit of a running joke, ''wifey material''. \n\nShe seemed like the PERFECT woman and I was a bit persistant when I first met her but eventually she agreed to go on a date from me, from then on it was history because we did have a lot in common. So now we married but one of the reasons I married her, aside from her personality, was that she was a virgin. She didn't sleep around whatsoever, she held out for the ''right guy'' and that guy was me. \n\nSo when I was talking to my female friend (30F) I said that one of the reasons I wanted to marry her was because of her personality AND the fact that she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. I thought this was an okay view to hold but she called me a ''Fucking asshole'' because she pointed out that I slept around in my youth. \n\nIt's true, when I was in my early 20's, I did a lot of sleeping around and hookup culture. And I could have seen myself marrying those girls if I was left with no choice, but they were never my IDEAL choices for partners, so I feel like Sofia was a god send in that regard. My friend (20F) still said I was being a hypocrite however what right does she have to criticize my dating choices? AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for marrying someone because she didn't sleep around, given that he himself had a history of doing so. \n\nFirst, the author is 30M and married to Sofia, 28F. He's Catholic but not very religious. He married her partly because she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. His friend called him an asshole for that, pointing out his own past behavior.\n\nSo, the main issue here is hypocrisy. The author is being criticized for valuing Sofia's virginity and not sleeping around, while he himself had a history of sleeping around. Is that hypocritical? Well, hypocrisy is when you hold others to standards you don't follow yourself. In this case, the author does admit to past behavior but now sees Sofia as ideal. \n\nBut does that make him wrong? It depends on perspective. Some might say it's okay if he's changed and values monogamy now. Others might see it as unfair to expect someone else to adhere to a standard he himself didn't meet. However, the author isn't judging others for their past; he's choosing his partner based on his current values. \n\nAlso, Sofia's choice to be a virgin was her own decision, so it's not about controlling her, but about his own preferences. The friend's criticism is about hypocrisy, but if the author is now choosing a committed relationship, maybe his standards have evolved. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe it's about double standards. If he's okay with his past but expects her to have a certain past, that could be seen as unfair. But if they're both committed now, perhaps it's not relevant. \n\nI think the key here is whether the author is respecting Sofia's autonomy. Since she chose to be a virgin and he respects that, it's her choice. The hypocrisy comes into play when he criticizes others for his past, but the user isn't doing that. He's just stating his own preferences. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for having his own preferences, especially if they align with his current values. The friend's reaction might be based on a personal opinion about hypocrisy, but the author isn't harming anyone. Therefore, the answer would be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
