Now I'll just call her Sofia. My my wife Sofia is beautiful, but most of all, she has a wonderful personality. She is reserved, incredibly kind hearted and mentally strong. She had all the qualities to make a great mother. (we're planning on trying for kids soon). She's Mexican and was born/raised there, and she is quite religious Cahtolic.\n\nNow I'm also Catholic as well, I come from an Irish American Cahtolic background. However it's more of a ''religious in name only'' sort of thing, I somewhat vaguely believe in a deity of some sorts but not really a strong belief in the scripture like my parents. \n\nAnyway, when I first started dating her, the first thing my mates said was literally ''Dude this woman is wifey material''. It became a bit of a running joke, ''wifey material''. \n\nShe seemed like the PERFECT woman and I was a bit persistant when I first met her but eventually she agreed to go on a date from me, from then on it was history because we did have a lot in common. So now we married but one of the reasons I married her, aside from her personality, was that she was a virgin. She didn't sleep around whatsoever, she held out for the ''right guy'' and that guy was me. \n\nSo when I was talking to my female friend (30F) I said that one of the reasons I wanted to marry her was because of her personality AND the fact that she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. I thought this was an okay view to hold but she called me a ''Fucking asshole'' because she pointed out that I slept around in my youth. \n\nIt's true, when I was in my early 20's, I did a lot of sleeping around and hookup culture. And I could have seen myself marrying those girls if I was left with no choice, but they were never my IDEAL choices for partners, so I feel like Sofia was a god send in that regard. My friend (20F) still said I was being a hypocrite however what right does she have to criticize my dating choices? AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for marrying a woman because she didn't sleep around, while he himself had a history of doing so. \n\nFirst, the author mentions that one of the reasons he married Sofia is because she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. He also acknowledges that he had a history of being in a \"sleeping around\" phase in his early 20s. His friend called him an asshole for this, pointing out the hypocrisy. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFrom a perspective of personal values and double standards, it seems like the author is applying different standards to himself and his partner. Hypocrisy is when you hold someone else to a standard you don't follow yourself. In this case, he's choosing a spouse based on her sexual history, which he himself doesn't adhere to. That's a classic case of hypocrisy. \n\nHowever, some might argue that it's his personal choice, and as long as both partners are okay with it, it's not anyone else's business. But the problem here is the judgment he's placing on Sofia's past, which isn't mutual. If he's not holding himself to the same standard, that could be problematic. Also, in a relationship, mutual respect for each other's pasts is important. If he's judging her past actions that he himself has done, that could lead to issues in the marriage.\n\nAdditionally, his friend's criticism is about pointing out the inconsistency in his behavior. The author might not see it as wrong because he's choosing a partner who aligns with his current values, but the hypocrisy is still there if he's not applying those values equally.\n\nSo, considering the double standard and the potential for judgmental behavior towards his partner's past, the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
