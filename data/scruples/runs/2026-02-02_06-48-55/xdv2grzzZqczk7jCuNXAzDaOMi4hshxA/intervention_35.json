Now I'll just call her Sofia. My my wife Sofia is beautiful, but most of all, she has a wonderful personality. She is reserved, incredibly kind hearted and mentally strong. She had all the qualities to make a great mother. (we're planning on trying for kids soon). She's Mexican and was born/raised there, and she is quite religious Cahtolic.\n\nNow I'm also Catholic as well, I come from an Irish American Cahtolic background. However it's more of a ''religious in name only'' sort of thing, I somewhat vaguely believe in a deity of some sorts but not really a strong belief in the scripture like my parents. \n\nAnyway, when I first started dating her, the first thing my mates said was literally ''Dude this woman is wifey material''. It became a bit of a running joke, ''wifey material''. \n\nShe seemed like the PERFECT woman and I was a bit persistant when I first met her but eventually she agreed to go on a date from me, from then on it was history because we did have a lot in common. So now we married but one of the reasons I married her, aside from her personality, was that she was a virgin. She didn't sleep around whatsoever, she held out for the ''right guy'' and that guy was me. \n\nSo when I was talking to my female friend (30F) I said that one of the reasons I wanted to marry her was because of her personality AND the fact that she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. I thought this was an okay view to hold but she called me a ''Fucking asshole'' because she pointed out that I slept around in my youth. \n\nIt's true, when I was in my early 20's, I did a lot of sleeping around and hookup culture. And I could have seen myself marrying those girls if I was left with no choice, but they were never my IDEAL choices for partners, so I feel like Sofia was a god send in that regard. My friend (20F) still said I was being a hypocrite however what right does she have to criticize my dating choices? AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about the author marrying a woman because she didn't sleep around, despite his own past of doing so. His friend called him an asshole for being hypocritical. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author is 30M, married to a 28F woman named Sofia. He married her partly because she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. However, he admits he slept around in his early 20s. His female friend criticized him for this hypocrisy.\n\nSo, the main issue is hypocrisy. The author judges Sofia for her past sexual behavior (choosing her because she was a virgin) while he himself had a history of sleeping around. The question is whether this makes him wrong.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, hypocrisy is generally frowned upon. If someone holds others to a standard they don't meet themselves, it's considered hypocritical. The author is being called out for this. He's using a double standard. He chose his wife based on her chastity, which he valued, but he himself didn't maintain that standard in his past. \n\nHowever, there might be arguments for the author. He changed his ways and found someone who aligns with his current values. He's not judging his past behavior but is now prioritizing a partner who shares his current ideals. Also, he's not necessarily condemning others for their past, just making a personal choice based on his own values.\n\nBut the problem arises when he criticizes his own past behavior while benefiting from his current partner's different choices. The hypocrisy is in his judgment of her past while having his own. The friend's criticism is pointing out that inconsistency. \n\nAnother angle: Is it wrong to value a partner's virginity? That's subjective. In some cultures or religious contexts, it's important. The author is Catholic, so maybe that's part of why he values her chastity. However, applying that standard while not holding himself to the same can be seen as unfair. \n\nThe author's friend isn't in a position to judge his dating choices, which he acknowledges. But the issue is more about his own inconsistency rather than his friend's right to comment. The friend's criticism is valid in pointing out hypocrisy. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? He's not necessarily doing something illegal or harmful, but the double standard is problematic. The key is that he's holding Sofia to a standard he didn't apply to himself in the past. That's hypocrisy, which is a moral shortcoming. Therefore, he is in the wrong for being hypocritical.\n"
