Now I'll just call her Sofia. My my wife Sofia is beautiful, but most of all, she has a wonderful personality. She is reserved, incredibly kind hearted and mentally strong. She had all the qualities to make a great mother. (we're planning on trying for kids soon). She's Mexican and was born/raised there, and she is quite religious Cahtolic.\n\nNow I'm also Catholic as well, I come from an Irish American Cahtolic background. However it's more of a ''religious in name only'' sort of thing, I somewhat vaguely believe in a deity of some sorts but not really a strong belief in the scripture like my parents. \n\nAnyway, when I first started dating her, the first thing my mates said was literally ''Dude this woman is wifey material''. It became a bit of a running joke, ''wifey material''. \n\nShe seemed like the PERFECT woman and I was a bit persistant when I first met her but eventually she agreed to go on a date from me, from then on it was history because we did have a lot in common. So now we married but one of the reasons I married her, aside from her personality, was that she was a virgin. She didn't sleep around whatsoever, she held out for the ''right guy'' and that guy was me. \n\nSo when I was talking to my female friend (30F) I said that one of the reasons I wanted to marry her was because of her personality AND the fact that she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. I thought this was an okay view to hold but she called me a ''Fucking asshole'' because she pointed out that I slept around in my youth. \n\nIt's true, when I was in my early 20's, I did a lot of sleeping around and hookup culture. And I could have seen myself marrying those girls if I was left with no choice, but they were never my IDEAL choices for partners, so I feel like Sofia was a god send in that regard. My friend (20F) still said I was being a hypocrite however what right does she have to criticize my dating choices? AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is a 30-year-old man who married Sofia, a 28-year-old Mexican Catholic woman. He mentions that she's beautiful, has a good personality, and he's planning to have kids with her. He also states that one of the main reasons he married her was because she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. He contrasts this with his own past where he \"slept around\" in his early 20s and mentions that he could have married those women if necessary, but Sofia was his ideal choice. His female friend called him an asshole for this reasoning, citing hypocrisy because he had a different past. The author is asking if he's in the wrong (AITA).\n\nFirst, I should consider the core issue here. The author is proud of marrying someone who is \"virgin\" and didn't engage in premarital sex, but he has a history of doing the opposite. His friend points out the hypocrisy, and the author is defending his choice. The question is whether he's in the wrong for holding this view and acting on it, despite his own past.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, double standards can be problematic. If the author judges others for their past behavior while being lenient on himself, that's hypocritical. The friend's criticism is that he's being a hypocrite. However, the author's reasoning is that the women he dated in the past weren't his ideal partners, whereas Sofia was. So, he's choosing the ideal partner based on his personal standards, even though his own past doesn't align with those standards.\n\nBut does that make him wrong? Well, the problem might be in the judgment he's placing on Sofia for her choices while being more accepting of his own past. In relationships, mutual respect and understanding are key. If the author values Sofia's virginity as a key factor in his decision to marry her, but he himself has a different past, that could be seen as imposing his own standards on her without considering her perspective. However, Sofia's choice to remain a virgin was her own, and she might not see it as a problem. The author's issue is more with the friend's criticism pointing out his inconsistency.\n\nAnother angle is societal norms and personal values. The author is Catholic, but he mentions it's more of a nominal thing for him. Sofia is Catholic and more devout, which might influence her decision to remain a virgin. The author's personal beliefs might not be as strict, but he chose to prioritize her values in this aspect. However, when he criticizes his past behavior, he's showing personal growth, which is positive. The hypocrisy comes into play when he judges others (or his friend judges him) for past actions that he himself has done.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, hypocrisy can be a moral issue. If the author is being hypocritical, that could be seen as in the wrong. However, the author isn't necessarily wrong in his choice to marry Sofia; he's just being called out for inconsistency in his standards. The key here is whether the double standard is a problem. If the author is respecting Sofia's personal choices and her reasons for being a virgin, then his decision to marry her isn't inherently wrong. But if he's applying different standards to himself and her without a valid reason, that's hypocrisy.\n\nThe friend's criticism is valid in pointing out the inconsistency. However, the author might argue that his past behavior doesn't invalidate his current values. People can change and grow, so his current standards might reflect his personal growth. The question is whether it's acceptable to hold different standards for oneself and one's partner, which is a common debate in relationships. Some might see it as acceptable as long as both partners are on the same page, while others might view it as unfair or discriminatory.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might be in the wrong if his actions are based on hypocrisy and double standards. However, if he's being transparent with his partner and they both agree on their values, then it's more about personal choice. The friend's criticism is about the inconsistency, but the author's perspective is that he's made a better choice now. The answer hinges on whether hypocrisy alone makes him wrong.\n"
