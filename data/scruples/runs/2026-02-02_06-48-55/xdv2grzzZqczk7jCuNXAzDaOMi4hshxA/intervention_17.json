Now I'll just call her Sofia. My my wife Sofia is beautiful, but most of all, she has a wonderful personality. She is reserved, incredibly kind hearted and mentally strong. She had all the qualities to make a great mother. (we're planning on trying for kids soon). She's Mexican and was born/raised there, and she is quite religious Cahtolic.\n\nNow I'm also Catholic as well, I come from an Irish American Cahtolic background. However it's more of a ''religious in name only'' sort of thing, I somewhat vaguely believe in a deity of some sorts but not really a strong belief in the scripture like my parents. \n\nAnyway, when I first started dating her, the first thing my mates said was literally ''Dude this woman is wifey material''. It became a bit of a running joke, ''wifey material''. \n\nShe seemed like the PERFECT woman and I was a bit persistant when I first met her but eventually she agreed to go on a date from me, from then on it was history because we did have a lot in common. So now we married but one of the reasons I married her, aside from her personality, was that she was a virgin. She didn't sleep around whatsoever, she held out for the ''right guy'' and that guy was me. \n\nSo when I was talking to my female friend (30F) I said that one of the reasons I wanted to marry her was because of her personality AND the fact that she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. I thought this was an okay view to hold but she called me a ''Fucking asshole'' because she pointed out that I slept around in my youth. \n\nIt's true, when I was in my early 20's, I did a lot of sleeping around and hookup culture. And I could have seen myself marrying those girls if I was left with no choice, but they were never my IDEAL choices for partners, so I feel like Sofia was a god send in that regard. My friend (20F) still said I was being a hypocrite however what right does she have to criticize my dating choices? AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for marrying a woman because she didn't sleep around, especially considering his own past of sleeping around. \n\nFirst, the author married Sofia because she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. He mentions his own past of hooking up with many people in his early 20s. His friend calls him an asshole for this, pointing out the hypocrisy.\n\nThe key issue here is hypocrisy. The author is judging Sofia's past (valuing her chastity) while he himself had a different history. This could be seen as double standards. However, the question is whether this makes him in the wrong. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, if someone holds others to a standard they don't hold themselves, that's hypocritical. But the author's reasoning for marrying Sofia is based on his personal preferences, not necessarily a moral judgment. He says he values her personality and she aligns with his ideals, which include her being a virgin. He also mentions religious background, which might influence his views.\n\nBut Sofia's own choice to be a virgin is her personal decision, and the author respecting that isn't inherently wrong. However, when he criticizes his own past and then uses that as a reason to marry someone else, it's inconsistent. His friend's point is valid in pointing out the hypocrisy. \n\nThe author's actions aren't necessarily harmful to Sofia, but the judgment of others' behavior based on his own past suggests a lack of self-awareness. Whether it's \"in the wrong\" depends on the context of the relationship and societal views. If Sofia is comfortable with his reasons, maybe it's not his fault. But ethically, the hypocrisy exists regardless of Sofia's consent.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether hypocrisy alone makes someone \"in the wrong.\" If the question is about moral fault, then yes, he's being hypocritical. But if it's about whether his marriage is valid, it's more about personal choice. The friend's criticism is valid, so the author might be in the wrong for that hypocrisy. Hence, the answer is A.\n"
