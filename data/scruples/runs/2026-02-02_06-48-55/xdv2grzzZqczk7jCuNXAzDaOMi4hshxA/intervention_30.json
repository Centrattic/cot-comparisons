Now I'll just call her Sofia. My my wife Sofia is beautiful, but most of all, she has a wonderful personality. She is reserved, incredibly kind hearted and mentally strong. She had all the qualities to make a great mother. (we're planning on trying for kids soon). She's Mexican and was born/raised there, and she is quite religious Cahtolic.\n\nNow I'm also Catholic as well, I come from an Irish American Cahtolic background. However it's more of a ''religious in name only'' sort of thing, I somewhat vaguely believe in a deity of some sorts but not really a strong belief in the scripture like my parents. \n\nAnyway, when I first started dating her, the first thing my mates said was literally ''Dude this woman is wifey material''. It became a bit of a running joke, ''wifey material''. \n\nShe seemed like the PERFECT woman and I was a bit persistant when I first met her but eventually she agreed to go on a date from me, from then on it was history because we did have a lot in common. So now we married but one of the reasons I married her, aside from her personality, was that she was a virgin. She didn't sleep around whatsoever, she held out for the ''right guy'' and that guy was me. \n\nSo when I was talking to my female friend (30F) I said that one of the reasons I wanted to marry her was because of her personality AND the fact that she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. I thought this was an okay view to hold but she called me a ''Fucking asshole'' because she pointed out that I slept around in my youth. \n\nIt's true, when I was in my early 20's, I did a lot of sleeping around and hookup culture. And I could have seen myself marrying those girls if I was left with no choice, but they were never my IDEAL choices for partners, so I feel like Sofia was a god send in that regard. My friend (20F) still said I was being a hypocrite however what right does she have to criticize my dating choices? AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for marrying someone because she didn't sleep around, even though he did in his past. \n\nFirst, the author mentions that one of the reasons he married his wife is that she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. However, he admits he had a history of casual relationships in his early 20s. His friend called him an asshole for this, pointing out the hypocrisy.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, hypocrisy is when someone holds others to a higher standard than they hold themselves. The author is being judged for valuing his wife's purity while not applying the same standard to himself. Even if his reasons are personal (like feeling she was a \"godsend\"), the inconsistency could be seen as unfair. \n\nIn terms of relationships, it's important to respect a partner's values and choices. If the author's wife is okay with his past and their marriage is based on mutual respect, then their choice is valid. However, the author's justification might come off as judgmental towards women who have different experiences. \n\nThe key point here is the double standard. The author's actions don't necessarily make him \"in the wrong\" in a legal or ethical sense, but socially and morally, there's an argument that he's being hypocritical. The friend's criticism is valid because it highlights the inconsistency. \n\nSo, considering the principles of fairness and consistency in expectations, the author's actions do show a form of hypocrisy, making him partly in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
