Now I'll just call her Sofia. My my wife Sofia is beautiful, but most of all, she has a wonderful personality. She is reserved, incredibly kind hearted and mentally strong. She had all the qualities to make a great mother. (we're planning on trying for kids soon). She's Mexican and was born/raised there, and she is quite religious Cahtolic.\n\nNow I'm also Catholic as well, I come from an Irish American Cahtolic background. However it's more of a ''religious in name only'' sort of thing, I somewhat vaguely believe in a deity of some sorts but not really a strong belief in the scripture like my parents. \n\nAnyway, when I first started dating her, the first thing my mates said was literally ''Dude this woman is wifey material''. It became a bit of a running joke, ''wifey material''. \n\nShe seemed like the PERFECT woman and I was a bit persistant when I first met her but eventually she agreed to go on a date from me, from then on it was history because we did have a lot in common. So now we married but one of the reasons I married her, aside from her personality, was that she was a virgin. She didn't sleep around whatsoever, she held out for the ''right guy'' and that guy was me. \n\nSo when I was talking to my female friend (30F) I said that one of the reasons I wanted to marry her was because of her personality AND the fact that she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. I thought this was an okay view to hold but she called me a ''Fucking asshole'' because she pointed out that I slept around in my youth. \n\nIt's true, when I was in my early 20's, I did a lot of sleeping around and hookup culture. And I could have seen myself marrying those girls if I was left with no choice, but they were never my IDEAL choices for partners, so I feel like Sofia was a god send in that regard. My friend (20F) still said I was being a hypocrite however what right does she have to criticize my dating choices? AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the guy married a woman who was a virgin, and he admitted that one of the reasons he married her was because she didn't sleep around. His friend called him an asshole because he had slept around in his youth. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was in a different phase of his life when he was sleeping around, and now he's with someone who was more reserved. He's honest about his past, which might be a point in his favor. However, the issue here is hypocrisy. He's judging his wife's past (or lack thereof) based on his own past behavior. Hypocrisy often comes into play when someone holds others to a standard they don't hold themselves to. \n\nBut wait, the author isn't judging his wife for her past because she didn't sleep around. Instead, he's valuing her for that. However, by his friend's point, since he had a different past, is it fair to expect the same from his wife? The key here might be whether his values are consistent. If he's being selective because he changed his views over time, that's one thing. But if he's holding a double standard without acknowledging his own past, that could be hypocritical.\n\nAlso, the fact that he's Catholic and his wife is Catholic adds another layer. The Catholic Church traditionally upholds the value of virginity before marriage, so maybe the author's views align with his religion. However, he mentioned that his own belief is more nominal. So his reasons might be more about personal preference than religious conviction. \n\nHis friend's criticism is about hypocrisy. The author is okay with his own past but expects others to adhere to different standards. That's a common point of hypocrisy. Even if his intentions were good (valuing commitment, etc.), the inconsistency in his behavior could make him wrong. \n\nBut then again, people change. Maybe he learned from his past and wants a more committed relationship now. The fact that he's planning to have kids might make him prioritize stability, which his wife offers. However, the main issue is whether it's fair for him to criticize his own past while holding his wife to a different standard. \n\nAnother angle is the respect towards his wife. If he married her for her personality and her values align with his current ones, that's positive. But bringing up his past in a way that implies she should be judged differently could be problematic. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might be in the wrong because he's holding a double standard. Even though he's changed, his past behavior contradicts the standards he applies to his wife. His friend's criticism points out that inconsistency, which is hypocritical. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
