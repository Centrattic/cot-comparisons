Now I'll just call her Sofia. My my wife Sofia is beautiful, but most of all, she has a wonderful personality. She is reserved, incredibly kind hearted and mentally strong. She had all the qualities to make a great mother. (we're planning on trying for kids soon). She's Mexican and was born/raised there, and she is quite religious Cahtolic.\n\nNow I'm also Catholic as well, I come from an Irish American Cahtolic background. However it's more of a ''religious in name only'' sort of thing, I somewhat vaguely believe in a deity of some sorts but not really a strong belief in the scripture like my parents. \n\nAnyway, when I first started dating her, the first thing my mates said was literally ''Dude this woman is wifey material''. It became a bit of a running joke, ''wifey material''. \n\nShe seemed like the PERFECT woman and I was a bit persistant when I first met her but eventually she agreed to go on a date from me, from then on it was history because we did have a lot in common. So now we married but one of the reasons I married her, aside from her personality, was that she was a virgin. She didn't sleep around whatsoever, she held out for the ''right guy'' and that guy was me. \n\nSo when I was talking to my female friend (30F) I said that one of the reasons I wanted to marry her was because of her personality AND the fact that she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. I thought this was an okay view to hold but she called me a ''Fucking asshole'' because she pointed out that I slept around in my youth. \n\nIt's true, when I was in my early 20's, I did a lot of sleeping around and hookup culture. And I could have seen myself marrying those girls if I was left with no choice, but they were never my IDEAL choices for partners, so I feel like Sofia was a god send in that regard. My friend (20F) still said I was being a hypocrite however what right does she have to criticize my dating choices? AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a man who married a woman because she was a virgin and didn't sleep around, even though he himself had a history of sleeping around in his youth. His friend called him an asshole for that, and he's asking if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is Catholic but not very religious, and his wife is Catholic too. He married her partly because she was a virgin. His friend points out his hypocrisy because he had a similar past. The author justifies it by saying the other women weren't his ideal choices, but the friend still criticizes him.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Hypocrisy comes to mind here. If he judges others for something he did himself, that's hypocritical. But maybe he's not judging others, just making a personal choice based on his values. However, the friend's criticism is about his own past actions. \n\nAlso, the author's reasoning for valuing a virgin spouse might be tied to his cultural or religious background. But if he's not a strict Catholic, does that still hold? The fact that he used his own past as a justification might be a problem. People often have different standards for themselves and others, which can be a red flag. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is choosing his own partner based on personal preferences. It's his choice to marry someone with those values. But the hypocrisy is in criticizing his past behavior while holding his wife to a different standard. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The key issue is hypocrisy. If he's okay with his past but holds a different standard for his wife without a consistent ethical basis, that's problematic. The friend is pointing out the inconsistency. Even if he's allowed to have his own preferences, being hypocritical about it might make him in the wrong in terms of how he treats others' pasts. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he's being hypocritical by holding his wife to a standard he himself didn't meet, which can be seen as judgmental and inconsistent.\n"
