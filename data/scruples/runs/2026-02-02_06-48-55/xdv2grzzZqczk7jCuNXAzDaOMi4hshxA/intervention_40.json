Now I'll just call her Sofia. My my wife Sofia is beautiful, but most of all, she has a wonderful personality. She is reserved, incredibly kind hearted and mentally strong. She had all the qualities to make a great mother. (we're planning on trying for kids soon). She's Mexican and was born/raised there, and she is quite religious Cahtolic.\n\nNow I'm also Catholic as well, I come from an Irish American Cahtolic background. However it's more of a ''religious in name only'' sort of thing, I somewhat vaguely believe in a deity of some sorts but not really a strong belief in the scripture like my parents. \n\nAnyway, when I first started dating her, the first thing my mates said was literally ''Dude this woman is wifey material''. It became a bit of a running joke, ''wifey material''. \n\nShe seemed like the PERFECT woman and I was a bit persistant when I first met her but eventually she agreed to go on a date from me, from then on it was history because we did have a lot in common. So now we married but one of the reasons I married her, aside from her personality, was that she was a virgin. She didn't sleep around whatsoever, she held out for the ''right guy'' and that guy was me. \n\nSo when I was talking to my female friend (30F) I said that one of the reasons I wanted to marry her was because of her personality AND the fact that she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. I thought this was an okay view to hold but she called me a ''Fucking asshole'' because she pointed out that I slept around in my youth. \n\nIt's true, when I was in my early 20's, I did a lot of sleeping around and hookup culture. And I could have seen myself marrying those girls if I was left with no choice, but they were never my IDEAL choices for partners, so I feel like Sofia was a god send in that regard. My friend (20F) still said I was being a hypocrite however what right does she have to criticize my dating choices? AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for marrying his wife because she didn't sleep around, especially since he had a history of sleeping around himself. \n\nFirst, the author is a 30-year-old man who married Sofia, a 28-year-old Mexican Catholic woman. He mentions that one of the key reasons he married her was her virginity and her not engaging in casual relationships. He now justifies this by saying that while he had a past with multiple partners, he didn't see those women as ideal choices. His friend, however, calls him a hypocrite and an asshole for this stance.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong. I need to assess if that's the case. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, holding someone to a standard you don't hold yourself to can be seen as hypocritical. The author is judging Sofia's past (valuing her virginity) while having his own past of promiscuity. This double standard might be the issue here. Even though personal choices can change, applying different standards to oneself and others can be problematic. \n\nAdditionally, Sofia's decision to be a virgin and the author's past are both personal choices. However, by marrying her for that reason, the author is placing a condition on their relationship that is based on her past behavior, which might not be fair. It's possible that this could affect how he treats her in the marriage, perhaps with less trust or more judgment than if he had married someone with a similar past. \n\nAlso, the friend pointing out the hypocrisy is valid because personal standards should ideally be consistent. The author's justification that he could have married others but didn't find them ideal doesn't negate the fact that he's being selective about Sofia's past while not applying the same leniency to his own. \n\nSo, considering these points, the author is in the wrong for applying a double standard. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
