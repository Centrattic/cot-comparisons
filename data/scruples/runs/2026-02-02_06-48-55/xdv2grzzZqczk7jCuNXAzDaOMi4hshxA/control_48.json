Now I'll just call her Sofia. My my wife Sofia is beautiful, but most of all, she has a wonderful personality. She is reserved, incredibly kind hearted and mentally strong. She had all the qualities to make a great mother. (we're planning on trying for kids soon). She's Mexican and was born/raised there, and she is quite religious Cahtolic.\n\nNow I'm also Catholic as well, I come from an Irish American Cahtolic background. However it's more of a ''religious in name only'' sort of thing, I somewhat vaguely believe in a deity of some sorts but not really a strong belief in the scripture like my parents. \n\nAnyway, when I first started dating her, the first thing my mates said was literally ''Dude this woman is wifey material''. It became a bit of a running joke, ''wifey material''. \n\nShe seemed like the PERFECT woman and I was a bit persistant when I first met her but eventually she agreed to go on a date from me, from then on it was history because we did have a lot in common. So now we married but one of the reasons I married her, aside from her personality, was that she was a virgin. She didn't sleep around whatsoever, she held out for the ''right guy'' and that guy was me. \n\nSo when I was talking to my female friend (30F) I said that one of the reasons I wanted to marry her was because of her personality AND the fact that she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. I thought this was an okay view to hold but she called me a ''Fucking asshole'' because she pointed out that I slept around in my youth. \n\nIt's true, when I was in my early 20's, I did a lot of sleeping around and hookup culture. And I could have seen myself marrying those girls if I was left with no choice, but they were never my IDEAL choices for partners, so I feel like Sofia was a god send in that regard. My friend (20F) still said I was being a hypocrite however what right does she have to criticize my dating choices? AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for marrying a woman because she didn't sleep around, despite his own past of doing so.\n\nFirst, the author is a 30-year-old man married to a 28-year-old woman. He's Catholic but not very religious. He married her partly because she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. His friend called him an asshole for this, pointing out his own history of sleeping around. The question is whether he's at fault.\n\nHmm, so the main issue here is hypocrisy. He judges his wife's past (or lack thereof) based on his current values but has a history that doesn't align with those standards. Does that make him wrong? Well, he's choosing a partner based on her sexual history, which some might see as judgmental or double standards. But he's also being honest about his reasons. \n\nHowever, the fact that he's holding her to a standard he himself didn't meet could be problematic. It's not just about his past versus hers, but about how he's using her virginity as a positive trait. That might come across as holding her to an outdated or unfair standard, especially if he's not applying the same criteria to himself. \n\nAlso, his friend is pointing out the hypocrisy, which others might agree with. The key here is whether his reasoning is valid. If he's okay with his own past but expects the same from his wife, that's a double standard. But if he's evolved and made a conscious choice to marry someone with different values, maybe that's his prerogative. \n\nBut the problem is that he's being hypocritical. It's not that he's wrong for marrying her because of her personality and other traits, but holding her virginity as a positive when he didn't meet that standard himself. So, it's more about the double standard than the marriage itself. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, society often frowns on double standards, especially in relationships. So the author might be in the wrong because he's applying different standards to himself and his wife. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
