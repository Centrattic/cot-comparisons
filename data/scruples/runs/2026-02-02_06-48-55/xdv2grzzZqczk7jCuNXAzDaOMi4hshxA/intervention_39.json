Now I'll just call her Sofia. My my wife Sofia is beautiful, but most of all, she has a wonderful personality. She is reserved, incredibly kind hearted and mentally strong. She had all the qualities to make a great mother. (we're planning on trying for kids soon). She's Mexican and was born/raised there, and she is quite religious Cahtolic.\n\nNow I'm also Catholic as well, I come from an Irish American Cahtolic background. However it's more of a ''religious in name only'' sort of thing, I somewhat vaguely believe in a deity of some sorts but not really a strong belief in the scripture like my parents. \n\nAnyway, when I first started dating her, the first thing my mates said was literally ''Dude this woman is wifey material''. It became a bit of a running joke, ''wifey material''. \n\nShe seemed like the PERFECT woman and I was a bit persistant when I first met her but eventually she agreed to go on a date from me, from then on it was history because we did have a lot in common. So now we married but one of the reasons I married her, aside from her personality, was that she was a virgin. She didn't sleep around whatsoever, she held out for the ''right guy'' and that guy was me. \n\nSo when I was talking to my female friend (30F) I said that one of the reasons I wanted to marry her was because of her personality AND the fact that she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. I thought this was an okay view to hold but she called me a ''Fucking asshole'' because she pointed out that I slept around in my youth. \n\nIt's true, when I was in my early 20's, I did a lot of sleeping around and hookup culture. And I could have seen myself marrying those girls if I was left with no choice, but they were never my IDEAL choices for partners, so I feel like Sofia was a god send in that regard. My friend (20F) still said I was being a hypocrite however what right does she have to criticize my dating choices? AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for marrying his wife because she didn't sleep around, especially since he had a different past.\n\nFirst, the author married Sofia because she was a virgin and didn't engage in casual relationships. He mentions that his friends joked about her being \"wifey material,\" and he values her chastity as part of his decision to marry her. However, his friend criticized him for being hypocritical since he had a history of sleeping around in his early 20s.\n\nThe key points here are about hypocrisy and double standards. The author is holding himself to a different standard than he did in the past. When he was younger, he was part of a more casual dating scene, but now he's choosing a partner who is the opposite. His friend points out that this is inconsistent, which makes her call him an asshole.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, is it wrong to value a partner's chastity if the individual has a different history? It depends on the perspective. If the author is being honest about his values and his wife shares those values, then it's not inherently wrong. However, if he's being hypocritical or judgmental towards others for not meeting his standards, that could be problematic.\n\nIn this case, the author is married to someone who fits his current values, which is a personal choice. The issue arises when he criticizes his past behavior but doesn't apply the same standard to others. His friend's criticism is valid in pointing out the hypocrisy. The question is whether the author's actions are wrong for being inconsistent rather than the marriage itself.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's about the double standard. If he's using his wife's chastity as a reason to look down on others or justify his own past, then yes. But if he's simply choosing a partner who aligns with his current values without being judgmental, then maybe not. The friend's reaction is a valid critique of the inconsistency, which might mean the author is in the wrong for not addressing his own hypocrisy.\n"
