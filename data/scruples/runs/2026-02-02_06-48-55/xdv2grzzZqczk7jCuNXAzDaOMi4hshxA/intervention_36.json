Now I'll just call her Sofia. My my wife Sofia is beautiful, but most of all, she has a wonderful personality. She is reserved, incredibly kind hearted and mentally strong. She had all the qualities to make a great mother. (we're planning on trying for kids soon). She's Mexican and was born/raised there, and she is quite religious Cahtolic.\n\nNow I'm also Catholic as well, I come from an Irish American Cahtolic background. However it's more of a ''religious in name only'' sort of thing, I somewhat vaguely believe in a deity of some sorts but not really a strong belief in the scripture like my parents. \n\nAnyway, when I first started dating her, the first thing my mates said was literally ''Dude this woman is wifey material''. It became a bit of a running joke, ''wifey material''. \n\nShe seemed like the PERFECT woman and I was a bit persistant when I first met her but eventually she agreed to go on a date from me, from then on it was history because we did have a lot in common. So now we married but one of the reasons I married her, aside from her personality, was that she was a virgin. She didn't sleep around whatsoever, she held out for the ''right guy'' and that guy was me. \n\nSo when I was talking to my female friend (30F) I said that one of the reasons I wanted to marry her was because of her personality AND the fact that she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. I thought this was an okay view to hold but she called me a ''Fucking asshole'' because she pointed out that I slept around in my youth. \n\nIt's true, when I was in my early 20's, I did a lot of sleeping around and hookup culture. And I could have seen myself marrying those girls if I was left with no choice, but they were never my IDEAL choices for partners, so I feel like Sofia was a god send in that regard. My friend (20F) still said I was being a hypocrite however what right does she have to criticize my dating choices? AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for marrying Sofia because she didn't sleep around, given his own past of sleeping around. \n\nFirst, the author is a 30-year-old man married to a 28-year-old woman who is a virgin. He mentions that one of the reasons he married her was her purity, despite his own history of being involved in hook-up culture in his early 20s. His friend called him an asshole for this hypocrisy.\n\nSo, the key issue here is hypocrisy. The author is choosing a partner based on her virginity, which he values, but he himself has a history of not upholding that same standard. That's the crux of the friend's criticism. \n\nBut wait, the author also mentions that he's Catholic, though not very religious. His wife is more devout. Maybe he's trying to align with her values now. But does that make it okay? Or is he still being inconsistent?\n\nAnother angle: the author is being honest about his reasons for marriage, but is it fair to judge someone else's past? The friend is a 20-year-old female, which might not be the best person to judge his relationship dynamics. But the user's question is about the author's rightness, not the friend's.\n\nIs it wrong to value a partner's virginity? That depends on cultural and personal beliefs. The author has a right to his preferences, but if he's holding himself to a different standard than he expects from others, that's hypocrisy. The question is whether that hypocrisy makes him wrong.\n\nIn relationships, it's important for both partners to share values. If the author is now in a monogamous, committed relationship, his past actions don't necessarily taint his current commitment. However, holding a double standard (judging his wife's past but not his own) could lead to issues in the relationship.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? The friend's criticism is valid in pointing out the hypocrisy. The author might be projecting his own past onto his wife's choices. However, people can change, and it's his right to choose a partner based on his current values. But if he's being hypocritical, that's where the problem lies.\n\nThe answer might hinge on whether hypocrisy alone is enough to be in the wrong. If the author is being honest and his wife is okay with his reasons, maybe he's not wrong. But if he's being judgmental about his own history while applying that to his wife, that's an issue. The friend's reaction is an external judgment, but the internal dynamics of the couple matter more. However, the user's question is about whether he's in the wrong in general.\n\nI think the answer is A (Yes), because the author is being hypocritical. He's holding his wife to a standard he himself didn't meet, which is unfair. Even if his reasons are his own, the double standard makes him in the wrong.\n"
