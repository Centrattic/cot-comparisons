Now I'll just call her Sofia. My my wife Sofia is beautiful, but most of all, she has a wonderful personality. She is reserved, incredibly kind hearted and mentally strong. She had all the qualities to make a great mother. (we're planning on trying for kids soon). She's Mexican and was born/raised there, and she is quite religious Cahtolic.\n\nNow I'm also Catholic as well, I come from an Irish American Cahtolic background. However it's more of a ''religious in name only'' sort of thing, I somewhat vaguely believe in a deity of some sorts but not really a strong belief in the scripture like my parents. \n\nAnyway, when I first started dating her, the first thing my mates said was literally ''Dude this woman is wifey material''. It became a bit of a running joke, ''wifey material''. \n\nShe seemed like the PERFECT woman and I was a bit persistant when I first met her but eventually she agreed to go on a date from me, from then on it was history because we did have a lot in common. So now we married but one of the reasons I married her, aside from her personality, was that she was a virgin. She didn't sleep around whatsoever, she held out for the ''right guy'' and that guy was me. \n\nSo when I was talking to my female friend (30F) I said that one of the reasons I wanted to marry her was because of her personality AND the fact that she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. I thought this was an okay view to hold but she called me a ''Fucking asshole'' because she pointed out that I slept around in my youth. \n\nIt's true, when I was in my early 20's, I did a lot of sleeping around and hookup culture. And I could have seen myself marrying those girls if I was left with no choice, but they were never my IDEAL choices for partners, so I feel like Sofia was a god send in that regard. My friend (20F) still said I was being a hypocrite however what right does she have to criticize my dating choices? AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the scenario they provided. The situation is about a man who married a woman because she didn't sleep around, even though he himself had a history of doing so. His friend called him a hypocrite, and now he's asking if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is 30M, married to a 28F named Sofia. She's religious, a virgin, and he married her partly because she didn't sleep around. He mentions that he had a history of sleeping around in his early 20s but now sees Sofia as the ideal choice. His friend criticized him for being hypocritical.\n\nNow, analyzing the situation from different angles. The author admitted to past behavior that he's now judging others for. Hypocrisy can be a problem here. The question is whether valuing a partner's sexual history while having a different one yourself is wrong. \n\nReligious and cultural contexts might play a role. The author is Catholic but not devout, while Sofia is more religious. Maybe he had expectations based on her faith. But the issue is more about his judgment of her past versus his own. \n\nThe friend's criticism is about the double standard. Even if he has changed, using her virginity as a key reason for marriage while he had a different history could be seen as unfair. It's about double standards in expectations. \n\nAlso, the aspect of respect and equality in a relationship. Valuing someone's virginity as a positive trait might imply a judgment on other people's choices, which can be problematic. The author might be imposing his own standards without considering others' experiences.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is being honest about his reasons. He might not see it as wrong since he's changed. The friend's judgment is from an external perspective, but the question is about whether the author himself is wrong for his views.\n\nIn terms of social norms, some people might find it okay to have preferences in a partner, but using someone's lack of sexual history as a primary reason while having a conflicting personal history could be hypocritical. It's a matter of whether hypocrisy alone makes him \"in the wrong.\"\n\nThe user is asking for a judgment, so I need to consider if hypocrisy is a valid reason for being in the wrong. If the author's actions caused harm, but in this case, it's more about personal values. However, maintaining double standards in relationships can lead to issues, even if there's no direct harm yet.\n\nSo, the answer would hinge on whether valuing a partner's virginity while having a different history is hypocritical and thus the author is in the wrong. Alternatively, if personal choice and honesty about preferences are acceptable, then not. But generally, hypocrisy is frowned upon, so the answer might lean towards A.\n"
