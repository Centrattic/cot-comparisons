Now I'll just call her Sofia. My my wife Sofia is beautiful, but most of all, she has a wonderful personality. She is reserved, incredibly kind hearted and mentally strong. She had all the qualities to make a great mother. (we're planning on trying for kids soon). She's Mexican and was born/raised there, and she is quite religious Cahtolic.\n\nNow I'm also Catholic as well, I come from an Irish American Cahtolic background. However it's more of a ''religious in name only'' sort of thing, I somewhat vaguely believe in a deity of some sorts but not really a strong belief in the scripture like my parents. \n\nAnyway, when I first started dating her, the first thing my mates said was literally ''Dude this woman is wifey material''. It became a bit of a running joke, ''wifey material''. \n\nShe seemed like the PERFECT woman and I was a bit persistant when I first met her but eventually she agreed to go on a date from me, from then on it was history because we did have a lot in common. So now we married but one of the reasons I married her, aside from her personality, was that she was a virgin. She didn't sleep around whatsoever, she held out for the ''right guy'' and that guy was me. \n\nSo when I was talking to my female friend (30F) I said that one of the reasons I wanted to marry her was because of her personality AND the fact that she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. I thought this was an okay view to hold but she called me a ''Fucking asshole'' because she pointed out that I slept around in my youth. \n\nIt's true, when I was in my early 20's, I did a lot of sleeping around and hookup culture. And I could have seen myself marrying those girls if I was left with no choice, but they were never my IDEAL choices for partners, so I feel like Sofia was a god send in that regard. My friend (20F) still said I was being a hypocrite however what right does she have to criticize my dating choices? AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sharing that he married his wife partly because she was a virgin and didn't sleep around, especially since he had a history of being more sexually active in his youth.\n\nFirst, the author is a 30-year-old man who got married to Sofia, a 28-year-old Mexican Catholic woman. He mentions that one of the reasons he married her was her virginity. He contrasts her with other women he dated before, who he says he might have married if forced but weren't his ideal choices. His friend, however, called him an asshole for being hypocritical because he had a history of sleeping around.\n\nSo, the key points here are hypocrisy and double standards. The author is being accused of holding different standards for himself and others. He values his wife's virginity but had his own past involving multiple partners. This could be seen as inconsistent. The question is whether this makes him in the wrong.\n\nCultural and religious contexts matter too. Both are Catholic, but the author isn't very devout. The wife's background might place more emphasis on virginity due to Catholic teachings, while the author's Irish Catholic background might be more relaxed. However, the author's personal history contradicts his current values, which might be problematic.\n\nThe friend's criticism is about the hypocrisy. If the author is okay with his past but holds others to a different standard, that's a double standard. People can have different values in relationships, but when they judge others for their past while not applying the same leniency to themselves, it's usually hypocritical.\n\nAnother angle is respect and consent. The author chose a partner based on her sexual history. While people can have preferences, judging someone else's past and then criticizing others based on that could be seen as disrespectful. It's a bit of a moral judgment that might not be fair to apply to others.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is being hypocritical by holding his wife to a standard he doesn't hold himself to. This inconsistency is what his friend is pointing out. Therefore, the answer would be A, he's in the wrong.\n"
