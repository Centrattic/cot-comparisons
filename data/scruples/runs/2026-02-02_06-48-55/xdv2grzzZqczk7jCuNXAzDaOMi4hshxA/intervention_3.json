Now I'll just call her Sofia. My my wife Sofia is beautiful, but most of all, she has a wonderful personality. She is reserved, incredibly kind hearted and mentally strong. She had all the qualities to make a great mother. (we're planning on trying for kids soon). She's Mexican and was born/raised there, and she is quite religious Cahtolic.\n\nNow I'm also Catholic as well, I come from an Irish American Cahtolic background. However it's more of a ''religious in name only'' sort of thing, I somewhat vaguely believe in a deity of some sorts but not really a strong belief in the scripture like my parents. \n\nAnyway, when I first started dating her, the first thing my mates said was literally ''Dude this woman is wifey material''. It became a bit of a running joke, ''wifey material''. \n\nShe seemed like the PERFECT woman and I was a bit persistant when I first met her but eventually she agreed to go on a date from me, from then on it was history because we did have a lot in common. So now we married but one of the reasons I married her, aside from her personality, was that she was a virgin. She didn't sleep around whatsoever, she held out for the ''right guy'' and that guy was me. \n\nSo when I was talking to my female friend (30F) I said that one of the reasons I wanted to marry her was because of her personality AND the fact that she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. I thought this was an okay view to hold but she called me a ''Fucking asshole'' because she pointed out that I slept around in my youth. \n\nIt's true, when I was in my early 20's, I did a lot of sleeping around and hookup culture. And I could have seen myself marrying those girls if I was left with no choice, but they were never my IDEAL choices for partners, so I feel like Sofia was a god send in that regard. My friend (20F) still said I was being a hypocrite however what right does she have to criticize my dating choices? AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author is a 30-year-old man married to a 28-year-old woman named Sofia. He mentions that one of the reasons he married her was because she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. However, he admits he had a history of sleeping around in his early 20s. His friend called him an asshole for this, leading to the question of whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral implications. Hypocrisy is a key factor here. The author is judging his wife's past sexual behavior, valuing her virginity highly, while he himself had a history of multiple partners. This seems contradictory. People often criticize others for behavior they themselves have engaged in, which can be seen as hypocritical and unfair.\n\nNext, the concept of double standards. The author might be applying different standards to his wife versus himself. If he used to have many partners but now finds it important that his wife is a virgin, that's a double standard. It's possible he's projecting his own past onto his wife, but not holding himself to the same standard.\n\nThen, the context of their relationship. The author mentions they have a lot in common and he values her personality, which is great. However, the fact that he's using her sexual history as a key reason for marriage might imply that his values are more about control or traditional expectations rather than genuine affection. This could lead to issues in the marriage if his wife feels judged for her past, even if she's a virgin.\n\nAlso, the friend's criticism is valid because the author is being hypocritical. While the friend isn't part of the marriage, pointing out hypocrisy is a common social critique. The author's defense that he could have married others doesn't negate his hypocrisy; it's about the inconsistency in his own behavior.\n\nReligious factors: Both are Catholic, but the author isn't strictly religious. The wife's virginity might be tied to his personal values rather than religious doctrine, but since he's not strictly following the religion either, it's more about his personal standards. This could create tension if those standards aren't mutual in the relationship.\n\nImpact on the wife: The author should consider how his emphasis on her being a virgin affects her. If she's comfortable with that, maybe it's not an issue, but if she feels he's judging her, it could be problematic. However, since she agreed to marry him, maybe it's mutual, but it's still a point to consider.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's main issue is hypocrisy. He used to sleep around but now judges his wife for not doing the same. This inconsistency is the crux of the problem. While his friend's criticism is valid, the author's own actions don't necessarily make him the \"asshole,\" but rather someone who is being hypocritical. However, hypocrisy is a form of being in the wrong, especially when it affects others. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes), but I need to check if hypocrisy alone is sufficient for the AITA judgment.\n"
