Now I'll just call her Sofia. My my wife Sofia is beautiful, but most of all, she has a wonderful personality. She is reserved, incredibly kind hearted and mentally strong. She had all the qualities to make a great mother. (we're planning on trying for kids soon). She's Mexican and was born/raised there, and she is quite religious Cahtolic.\n\nNow I'm also Catholic as well, I come from an Irish American Cahtolic background. However it's more of a ''religious in name only'' sort of thing, I somewhat vaguely believe in a deity of some sorts but not really a strong belief in the scripture like my parents. \n\nAnyway, when I first started dating her, the first thing my mates said was literally ''Dude this woman is wifey material''. It became a bit of a running joke, ''wifey material''. \n\nShe seemed like the PERFECT woman and I was a bit persistant when I first met her but eventually she agreed to go on a date from me, from then on it was history because we did have a lot in common. So now we married but one of the reasons I married her, aside from her personality, was that she was a virgin. She didn't sleep around whatsoever, she held out for the ''right guy'' and that guy was me. \n\nSo when I was talking to my female friend (30F) I said that one of the reasons I wanted to marry her was because of her personality AND the fact that she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. I thought this was an okay view to hold but she called me a ''Fucking asshole'' because she pointed out that I slept around in my youth. \n\nIt's true, when I was in my early 20's, I did a lot of sleeping around and hookup culture. And I could have seen myself marrying those girls if I was left with no choice, but they were never my IDEAL choices for partners, so I feel like Sofia was a god send in that regard. My friend (20F) still said I was being a hypocrite however what right does she have to criticize my dating choices? AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that he married Sofia for various reasons, including her being a virgin and not sleeping around. He mentioned this to his female friend, who then criticized him because he had a history of sleeping around in his youth. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is Catholic, and Sofia is Catholic too. He mentions his religious background, but he's not very devout. Sofia is described as a virgin, which was a factor in his decision to marry her. He acknowledges that he was not a virgin when he was younger and had a lot of sexual partners, but he now sees Sofia as the ideal partner.\n\nThe friend called him an asshole for being hypocritical. The author is defending himself by saying that while he had those past experiences, the women he might have married if left with no choice were not his ideal choices. He sees Sofia as a \"godsend\" because she was a virgin and had the qualities he wanted in a long-term partner.\n\nI need to assess whether his reasoning is valid. The author is justifying his current preferences based on his past actions. However, the issue here is whether it's acceptable to hold a double standard. If someone criticizes him for this, is he being hypocritical?\n\nThe author's main point is that his past behavior doesn't negate his current values. But if he's applying different standards to his current partner versus himself, that could be seen as unfair. For example, if he judges Sofia's sexual history more than his own, that's a double standard. However, the author says that the reason Sofia was chosen was her personality and being a virgin, which he values because of his Catholic background. \n\nBut the problem arises when he openly expresses that his decision to marry her was partly based on her being a virgin, even though he wasn't a virgin himself. The friend's criticism is about hypocrisy because he uses his past to justify his current stance, which might not be fair. \n\nReligious context: Catholic teachings generally emphasize chastity before marriage, so Sofia's being a virgin aligns with that. However, the author's own lack of devoutness might mean his reasons are more about personal preference than religious duty. \n\nIs the author wrong for valuing Sofia's virginity while having a different past? That's a personal choice, but when he points out his friend's hypocrisy, it's not entirely clear if he's in the wrong. However, the friend's criticism is valid if he's applying different standards to himself and his partner. \n\nSo, the key here is whether his preference for his wife's virginity despite his own history is a double standard. If he's okay with his own past but expects the same from his wife, that's a double standard. But if he's changed his views and his current preferences are based on his evolving standards, then it's not necessarily in the wrong. However, when he criticizes his friend for being a hypocrite, that's where the problem might lie. \n\nIn conclusion, the author is in the wrong because he's being hypocritical by applying different standards to himself and his wife, especially when he's the one who had a history of not being monogamous. His justification doesn't fully address the double standard, so he's not in the wrong. Wait, wait. Let me think again. \n\nThe author says he married Sofia because she didn't sleep around, which was a positive trait for him. The friend points out that he himself did, so he's being hypocritical. But the author argues that he's not trying to shame his own past, just that he chose differently this time. However, the inconsistency is there. So, is he in the wrong? If the question is about whether he's being hypocritical, then yes, but does that make him in the wrong? It depends on the context. If he's being hypocritical, maybe not in the wrong, but the friend is right to point it out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. \n\nIn terms of ethics, holding a double standard can be problematic. The author's reasoning is that he values virginity in a partner but has his own past. If he's honest about his own history, then it's not necessarily wrong, but it's a double standard. However, people can have different preferences based on their values. The author's friend's reaction is valid because he's being hypocritical by applying different standards. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because he's being hypocritical.\n"
