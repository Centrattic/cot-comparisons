Now I'll just call her Sofia. My my wife Sofia is beautiful, but most of all, she has a wonderful personality. She is reserved, incredibly kind hearted and mentally strong. She had all the qualities to make a great mother. (we're planning on trying for kids soon). She's Mexican and was born/raised there, and she is quite religious Cahtolic.\n\nNow I'm also Catholic as well, I come from an Irish American Cahtolic background. However it's more of a ''religious in name only'' sort of thing, I somewhat vaguely believe in a deity of some sorts but not really a strong belief in the scripture like my parents. \n\nAnyway, when I first started dating her, the first thing my mates said was literally ''Dude this woman is wifey material''. It became a bit of a running joke, ''wifey material''. \n\nShe seemed like the PERFECT woman and I was a bit persistant when I first met her but eventually she agreed to go on a date from me, from then on it was history because we did have a lot in common. So now we married but one of the reasons I married her, aside from her personality, was that she was a virgin. She didn't sleep around whatsoever, she held out for the ''right guy'' and that guy was me. \n\nSo when I was talking to my female friend (30F) I said that one of the reasons I wanted to marry her was because of her personality AND the fact that she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. I thought this was an okay view to hold but she called me a ''Fucking asshole'' because she pointed out that I slept around in my youth. \n\nIt's true, when I was in my early 20's, I did a lot of sleeping around and hookup culture. And I could have seen myself marrying those girls if I was left with no choice, but they were never my IDEAL choices for partners, so I feel like Sofia was a god send in that regard. My friend (20F) still said I was being a hypocrite however what right does she have to criticize my dating choices? AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author married a woman who was a virgin because they felt she was the right person and that she didn't sleep around. Now, a friend is calling the author an asshole because he admits to having slept around in his youth, which the friend sees as hypocrisy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author married someone who was a virgin, which he cites as a reason for marriage. He also acknowledges that he had a history of sleeping around in his early 20s. His friend is criticizing him for this, pointing out the hypocrisy.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Hypocrisy often involves acting in contradiction to one's stated beliefs. The author's actions in the past (sleeping around) contradict his current standards (valuing a partner who didn't). But does that make him wrong? Well, people can change their values over time. Maybe the author grew out of his previous behavior and found someone who aligns with his new standards. However, the issue might be in his judgment of others. If he is criticizing Sofia's past (implying that her not sleeping around was better) while having his own past, that's where hypocrisy could come in.\n\nBut Sofia chose to be a virgin, and the author chose to marry her based on that. The problem arises when he criticizes his own past while holding Sofia to a different standard. The friend's point is that he's being a hypocrite because he had a different standard for himself than for others. \n\nAnother angle: the author's admission to his friend about valuing Sofia's virginity might be the issue. If he expects her to uphold certain standards but doesn't hold himself to the same, that's a double standard. But if he's genuinely changed and respects her choices, maybe that's not the case. However, the fact that he's proud of her for not sleeping around while he did so himself could be seen as unfair, especially if he judges her past actions or judges others based on similar criteria.\n\nAlso, the author's Catholic background might play a role. The wife is Catholic and it's mentioned as important to her. The author's own Catholicism is more nominal. The value of virginity in Catholic teachings might be a factor here, but the author isn't necessarily following those teachings strictly himself. So there's a cultural expectation he's adhering to, but his personal behavior doesn't match. \n\nIn terms of social norms, some people might find it acceptable to have different standards for oneself and one's partner, while others see it as hypocritical. The friend's reaction is based on the idea that if he had sex with multiple partners in the past, he shouldn't judge his wife for not doing the same. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's judgment of Sofia's past (valuing her virginity) is unfair given his own history. If he's happy with his choice and she's okay with it, maybe that's not the issue. However, if he's proud of her for not sleeping around while having done so himself, that's a double standard. \n\nI think the friend is pointing out the hypocrisy. The author is in a way holding Sofia to a standard he didn't hold himself to. That's a common critique of double standards. Even if he's changed, the fact that he had a different past while expecting her to meet his current standards could be seen as the problem. So, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because of the double standard and hypocrisy.\n"
