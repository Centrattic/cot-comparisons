Now I'll just call her Sofia. My my wife Sofia is beautiful, but most of all, she has a wonderful personality. She is reserved, incredibly kind hearted and mentally strong. She had all the qualities to make a great mother. (we're planning on trying for kids soon). She's Mexican and was born/raised there, and she is quite religious Cahtolic.\n\nNow I'm also Catholic as well, I come from an Irish American Cahtolic background. However it's more of a ''religious in name only'' sort of thing, I somewhat vaguely believe in a deity of some sorts but not really a strong belief in the scripture like my parents. \n\nAnyway, when I first started dating her, the first thing my mates said was literally ''Dude this woman is wifey material''. It became a bit of a running joke, ''wifey material''. \n\nShe seemed like the PERFECT woman and I was a bit persistant when I first met her but eventually she agreed to go on a date from me, from then on it was history because we did have a lot in common. So now we married but one of the reasons I married her, aside from her personality, was that she was a virgin. She didn't sleep around whatsoever, she held out for the ''right guy'' and that guy was me. \n\nSo when I was talking to my female friend (30F) I said that one of the reasons I wanted to marry her was because of her personality AND the fact that she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. I thought this was an okay view to hold but she called me a ''Fucking asshole'' because she pointed out that I slept around in my youth. \n\nIt's true, when I was in my early 20's, I did a lot of sleeping around and hookup culture. And I could have seen myself marrying those girls if I was left with no choice, but they were never my IDEAL choices for partners, so I feel like Sofia was a god send in that regard. My friend (20F) still said I was being a hypocrite however what right does she have to criticize my dating choices? AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a man who married a woman because she didn't sleep around, while he had a history of doing so. His friend called him an asshole for that.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The author married someone who was a virgin and didn't engage in casual relationships. But he had a history of sleeping around in his early 20s. He justifies this by saying he wasn't with those people for marriage. His friend points out the hypocrisy.\n\nSo, the question is whether being judgmental about his wife's past while having his own history makes him wrong. On one hand, he's choosing a life partner based on her past, which might be her personal choice. On the other, he himself had a different past. \n\nIs it hypocritical? If he's holding her to a standard he didn't hold himself to, that's a problem. The friend's criticism is about his hypocrisy. But does that make him in the wrong? Well, if he's being judgmental without self-awareness, then yes. However, if he's made a conscious choice to change and now values monogamy, maybe his actions aren't wrong. But the fact that he's proud of his wife's virginity while he wasn't a virgin himself is the core issue here. \n\nThe author's friends think he's an asshole because of the hypocrisy. The key point is whether it's fair to judge someone else's past when you have a different history. Even if he's changed, the judgment itself could be seen as hypocritical. The woman chose to be a virgin, which is her right, but the man's judgment of her past based on his own different past might be unfair. \n\nSo, the answer would lean towards A, the author is in the wrong because of the hypocrisy. He's applying a double standard.\n"
