Now I'll just call her Sofia. My my wife Sofia is beautiful, but most of all, she has a wonderful personality. She is reserved, incredibly kind hearted and mentally strong. She had all the qualities to make a great mother. (we're planning on trying for kids soon). She's Mexican and was born/raised there, and she is quite religious Cahtolic.\n\nNow I'm also Catholic as well, I come from an Irish American Cahtolic background. However it's more of a ''religious in name only'' sort of thing, I somewhat vaguely believe in a deity of some sorts but not really a strong belief in the scripture like my parents. \n\nAnyway, when I first started dating her, the first thing my mates said was literally ''Dude this woman is wifey material''. It became a bit of a running joke, ''wifey material''. \n\nShe seemed like the PERFECT woman and I was a bit persistant when I first met her but eventually she agreed to go on a date from me, from then on it was history because we did have a lot in common. So now we married but one of the reasons I married her, aside from her personality, was that she was a virgin. She didn't sleep around whatsoever, she held out for the ''right guy'' and that guy was me. \n\nSo when I was talking to my female friend (30F) I said that one of the reasons I wanted to marry her was because of her personality AND the fact that she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. I thought this was an okay view to hold but she called me a ''Fucking asshole'' because she pointed out that I slept around in my youth. \n\nIt's true, when I was in my early 20's, I did a lot of sleeping around and hookup culture. And I could have seen myself marrying those girls if I was left with no choice, but they were never my IDEAL choices for partners, so I feel like Sofia was a god send in that regard. My friend (20F) still said I was being a hypocrite however what right does she have to criticize my dating choices? AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for marrying his wife because she didn't sleep around, while he had a history of doing so. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author married a woman who was a virgin and didn't have many sexual partners. He admitted that he had a more active dating life in his early 20s and could have married others if circumstances were different. His friend criticized him for being a hypocrite.\n\nThe key here is whether valuing a partner's sexual history while having a different personal history is wrong. The author's reasoning is that he chose to marry someone who aligned with his current values, even if his past didn't. But his friend argues hypocrisy because he didn't maintain the same standards in the past.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, people can change their values over time. The author might have matured and now prioritizes different qualities in a partner. However, the issue arises when he judges others or his partner for their past. The friend's point is that by holding his wife to a standard he didn't hold himself to in the past, he's being inconsistent. \n\nBut does that mean he's in the wrong? Well, if he's honest with his wife and they both agree on their values, then it's their choice. However, if he's being judgmental or hypocritical towards others (like his friend) about this, that's where the problem lies. The question is whether the act of marrying someone based on their sexual history, given his own past, is wrong. \n\nIt's not inherently wrong to prioritize certain traits in a partner. What could be problematic is if he's being hypocritical or judgmental without acknowledging his own past. The friend's criticism is valid in pointing out the inconsistency, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for changing his standards over time. The key is whether he respects his wife's autonomy and they both have mutual understanding. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions aren't necessarily wrong because people's values can evolve. However, there's an element of hypocrisy if he's not applying the same standards to himself now. But since he's marrying someone who shares his current values, it's a personal choice. The answer might be that he's not in the wrong (B), but there's room for discussion on hypocrisy.\n"
