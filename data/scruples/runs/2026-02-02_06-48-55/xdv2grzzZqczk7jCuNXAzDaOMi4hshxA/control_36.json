Now I'll just call her Sofia. My my wife Sofia is beautiful, but most of all, she has a wonderful personality. She is reserved, incredibly kind hearted and mentally strong. She had all the qualities to make a great mother. (we're planning on trying for kids soon). She's Mexican and was born/raised there, and she is quite religious Cahtolic.\n\nNow I'm also Catholic as well, I come from an Irish American Cahtolic background. However it's more of a ''religious in name only'' sort of thing, I somewhat vaguely believe in a deity of some sorts but not really a strong belief in the scripture like my parents. \n\nAnyway, when I first started dating her, the first thing my mates said was literally ''Dude this woman is wifey material''. It became a bit of a running joke, ''wifey material''. \n\nShe seemed like the PERFECT woman and I was a bit persistant when I first met her but eventually she agreed to go on a date from me, from then on it was history because we did have a lot in common. So now we married but one of the reasons I married her, aside from her personality, was that she was a virgin. She didn't sleep around whatsoever, she held out for the ''right guy'' and that guy was me. \n\nSo when I was talking to my female friend (30F) I said that one of the reasons I wanted to marry her was because of her personality AND the fact that she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. I thought this was an okay view to hold but she called me a ''Fucking asshole'' because she pointed out that I slept around in my youth. \n\nIt's true, when I was in my early 20's, I did a lot of sleeping around and hookup culture. And I could have seen myself marrying those girls if I was left with no choice, but they were never my IDEAL choices for partners, so I feel like Sofia was a god send in that regard. My friend (20F) still said I was being a hypocrite however what right does she have to criticize my dating choices? AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for the situation described. The author married Sofia because she was a virgin and didn't sleep around, even though he himself had a history of sleeping around in his youth. His friend called him an asshole for this, saying he was a hypocrite.\n\nHmm. The key points here are hypocrisy and double standards. The author is valuing Sofia's virginity highly, but he doesn't hold himself to the same standard. His friend is pointing out that he slept around, so why is it okay for Sofia to be a virgin but not for him? That does seem like a double standard. \n\nBut then, the author argues that he married Sofia because she was a \"godsend\" and she's the ideal partner. He mentions that the other women he dated weren't his ideal choices. But the issue is whether his reasoning for valuing her virginity over his own past actions is valid. \n\nReligious or cultural factors might play a role here. Both are Catholic, but the author says his Catholic beliefs are more nominal. The value placed on virginity could be more cultural or personal preference rather than religious doctrine. If he's using his past as an excuse, that could be a problem.\n\nAlso, the friend's criticism isn't about his past but the double standard. The author is being accused of being hypocritical by holding Sofia to a standard he doesn't hold himself to. Even if his reasons for choosing Sofia are genuine, the inconsistency could make him appear judgmental. \n\nIs it wrong to have different expectations for oneself and a partner? That's a common debate. Some people argue that personal history shouldn't dictate one's partner's past. If the author is okay with his own history, why should Sofia's be a factor? It could be seen as unfair or controlling. \n\nOn the other hand, people do have preferences in partners. But when those preferences are based on a double standard, especially after being called out for hypocrisy, it might be problematic. The author's justification that he's not looking to marry someone like his past partners might not hold up because the issue is the inconsistency in standards, not the specific partners.\n\nSo, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because of the hypocrisy. Even if his reasons for marrying Sofia are good, the double standard is a valid criticism. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
