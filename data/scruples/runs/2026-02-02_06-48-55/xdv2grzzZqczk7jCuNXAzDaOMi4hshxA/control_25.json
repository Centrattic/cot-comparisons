Now I'll just call her Sofia. My my wife Sofia is beautiful, but most of all, she has a wonderful personality. She is reserved, incredibly kind hearted and mentally strong. She had all the qualities to make a great mother. (we're planning on trying for kids soon). She's Mexican and was born/raised there, and she is quite religious Cahtolic.\n\nNow I'm also Catholic as well, I come from an Irish American Cahtolic background. However it's more of a ''religious in name only'' sort of thing, I somewhat vaguely believe in a deity of some sorts but not really a strong belief in the scripture like my parents. \n\nAnyway, when I first started dating her, the first thing my mates said was literally ''Dude this woman is wifey material''. It became a bit of a running joke, ''wifey material''. \n\nShe seemed like the PERFECT woman and I was a bit persistant when I first met her but eventually she agreed to go on a date from me, from then on it was history because we did have a lot in common. So now we married but one of the reasons I married her, aside from her personality, was that she was a virgin. She didn't sleep around whatsoever, she held out for the ''right guy'' and that guy was me. \n\nSo when I was talking to my female friend (30F) I said that one of the reasons I wanted to marry her was because of her personality AND the fact that she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. I thought this was an okay view to hold but she called me a ''Fucking asshole'' because she pointed out that I slept around in my youth. \n\nIt's true, when I was in my early 20's, I did a lot of sleeping around and hookup culture. And I could have seen myself marrying those girls if I was left with no choice, but they were never my IDEAL choices for partners, so I feel like Sofia was a god send in that regard. My friend (20F) still said I was being a hypocrite however what right does she have to criticize my dating choices? AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for marrying Sofia because she didn't sleep around, even though he did in his youth. The author is 30M, married to 28F Sofia. He's Catholic but not super religious. His friends called Sofia \"wifey material,\" and he admitted that one reason he married her was because she was a virgin. His female friend called him an asshole for that, pointing out his past behavior.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author's justification: he values Sofia's purity and her decision to wait for the \"right guy.\" He sees her as ideal, contrasting with his past hookups. His friend argues hypocrisy because he had a different past. \n\nNow, hypocrisy usually involves inconsistency in one's actions. He's pointing out her virtue while ignoring his own past. But does that make him wrong? Well, the key here is whether it's fair to judge someone else's choices, especially when you have your own history. \n\nThe author is being honest about his reasons, but his friend is pointing out the inconsistency. Hypocrisy isn't always wrong, but in relationships, double standards can be problematic. If he expects his partner to have certain standards but doesn't hold himself to the same, that could be an issue. \n\nAlso, the fact that he's Catholic and they share that background might influence his values, but he's not strict about it. So his reasoning might stem from personal preferences rather than religious doctrine. However, valuing a partner's virginity can be problematic if it's based on outdated or sexist notions of purity. \n\nIn modern contexts, some might see this as placing undue importance on a woman's sexual history, which isn't the partner's right to judge. But others might see it as a personal choice as long as both parties agree. However, the author's admission of hypocrisy is a red flag. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author's judgment of his wife's past (or lack thereof) is unfair compared to his own. If he's not applying the same standard to himself, that's hypocritical. But does that make him wrong? It depends on the context. If Sofia is okay with the marriage and they're happy, maybe not. But the act of holding others to a different standard than oneself is typically seen as hypocritical. \n\nThe friend's criticism is valid in pointing out the inconsistency. However, the author's reasoning might be based on personal values, even if they're inconsistent. But in terms of morality or fairness, inconsistency can be a problem. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, hypocrisy is a matter of judgment. The author is being hypocritical, but whether that makes him \"in the wrong\" depends on societal standards. If the question is about double standards and judgment, then yes, he's in the wrong for holding a double standard. But if the question is about the validity of his marriage choice, maybe not. \n\nIn the AITA context, the community often looks at hypocrisy and judgment. Since he's being judged for hypocrisy, the answer here would lean towards A (yes, he's in the wrong) because he's applying a standard that doesn't align with his own history, which is a form of judgment and inconsistency.\n"
