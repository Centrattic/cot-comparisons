Now I'll just call her Sofia. My my wife Sofia is beautiful, but most of all, she has a wonderful personality. She is reserved, incredibly kind hearted and mentally strong. She had all the qualities to make a great mother. (we're planning on trying for kids soon). She's Mexican and was born/raised there, and she is quite religious Cahtolic.\n\nNow I'm also Catholic as well, I come from an Irish American Cahtolic background. However it's more of a ''religious in name only'' sort of thing, I somewhat vaguely believe in a deity of some sorts but not really a strong belief in the scripture like my parents. \n\nAnyway, when I first started dating her, the first thing my mates said was literally ''Dude this woman is wifey material''. It became a bit of a running joke, ''wifey material''. \n\nShe seemed like the PERFECT woman and I was a bit persistant when I first met her but eventually she agreed to go on a date from me, from then on it was history because we did have a lot in common. So now we married but one of the reasons I married her, aside from her personality, was that she was a virgin. She didn't sleep around whatsoever, she held out for the ''right guy'' and that guy was me. \n\nSo when I was talking to my female friend (30F) I said that one of the reasons I wanted to marry her was because of her personality AND the fact that she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. I thought this was an okay view to hold but she called me a ''Fucking asshole'' because she pointed out that I slept around in my youth. \n\nIt's true, when I was in my early 20's, I did a lot of sleeping around and hookup culture. And I could have seen myself marrying those girls if I was left with no choice, but they were never my IDEAL choices for partners, so I feel like Sofia was a god send in that regard. My friend (20F) still said I was being a hypocrite however what right does she have to criticize my dating choices? AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about him marrying a woman because she didn't sleep around, even though he had a history of doing so. He's defending his choice by saying that the other people he dated in his 20s weren't his ideal choices, and Sofia was a \"godsend.\" His friend called him an asshole for this, and he's asking if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The author is being hypocritical, right? He's criticizing Sofia's past sexual behavior (or lack thereof) while having a similar or worse history himself. But he's not being hypocritical in the same way because he's not holding others to the same standard. Wait, maybe he is. He's looking for someone who didn't sleep around, but he did. So that's hypocrisy.\n\nBut then, he's honest about his past. He admits he slept around in his early 20s. However, he's choosing a partner based on her virginity, which could be seen as holding her to a double standard. The fact that he's Catholic might influence his values here, but he also mentions that his personal faith isn't strong. So maybe his reasoning is based more on personal preference than religious doctrine.\n\nThe key question is whether it's wrong to value a partner's virginity if you've had similar behavior in the past. Some people might argue that it's hypocritical and unfair to expect a partner to adhere to standards he himself didn't follow. Others might say that everyone has different values and that it's his choice as long as both parties consent. But in this case, Sofia's virginity was a significant factor in his decision to marry her, which could be problematic because it's a judgment based on her past that he's not applying to himself.\n\nAlso, when he told his female friend this, she reacted negatively, calling him an asshole. His friend's reaction suggests that she perceives this as hypocritical. While the friend has no actual authority over his choices, the fact that someone else sees it as wrong might indicate that there's an issue. However, the author's perspective is that he's being honest and that his past is different because he's choosing the \"ideal\" partner now. \n\nBut the problem here is that he's using a standard (virginity) to judge Sofia that he doesn't hold himself to. That can be seen as double standards or even moral hypocrisy. Even if both were virgins, it's his past behavior that's different, and he's choosing someone who shares his current values. However, the criticism from his friend points out that his own past doesn't align with the standard he's applying to his wife. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If holding someone to a standard you don't hold yourself to is wrong, then yes. But personal values can vary. The answer might depend on cultural or personal beliefs. However, in many modern contexts, this would be seen as hypocritical and judgmental. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for this double standard.\n"
