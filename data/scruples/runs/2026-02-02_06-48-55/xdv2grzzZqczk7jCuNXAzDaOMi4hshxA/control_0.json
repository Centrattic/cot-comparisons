Now I'll just call her Sofia. My my wife Sofia is beautiful, but most of all, she has a wonderful personality. She is reserved, incredibly kind hearted and mentally strong. She had all the qualities to make a great mother. (we're planning on trying for kids soon). She's Mexican and was born/raised there, and she is quite religious Cahtolic.\n\nNow I'm also Catholic as well, I come from an Irish American Cahtolic background. However it's more of a ''religious in name only'' sort of thing, I somewhat vaguely believe in a deity of some sorts but not really a strong belief in the scripture like my parents. \n\nAnyway, when I first started dating her, the first thing my mates said was literally ''Dude this woman is wifey material''. It became a bit of a running joke, ''wifey material''. \n\nShe seemed like the PERFECT woman and I was a bit persistant when I first met her but eventually she agreed to go on a date from me, from then on it was history because we did have a lot in common. So now we married but one of the reasons I married her, aside from her personality, was that she was a virgin. She didn't sleep around whatsoever, she held out for the ''right guy'' and that guy was me. \n\nSo when I was talking to my female friend (30F) I said that one of the reasons I wanted to marry her was because of her personality AND the fact that she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. I thought this was an okay view to hold but she called me a ''Fucking asshole'' because she pointed out that I slept around in my youth. \n\nIt's true, when I was in my early 20's, I did a lot of sleeping around and hookup culture. And I could have seen myself marrying those girls if I was left with no choice, but they were never my IDEAL choices for partners, so I feel like Sofia was a god send in that regard. My friend (20F) still said I was being a hypocrite however what right does she have to criticize my dating choices? AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for marrying someone because she didn't sleep around, when he used to sleep around himself. The author, let's call him John, married Sofia, who's a virgin. He's Catholic but not super religious. His friends joked about her being \"wifey material.\" He admitted to hooking up a lot in his early 20s.\n\nHe told his female friend that one reason he married Sofia was her virginity, and she called him an asshole for being a hypocrite. The question is whether he's wrong for this. \n\nSo, first, is being a hypocrite a reason to be in the wrong? Hypocrisy isn't necessarily wrong. People can have different standards for themselves and others for various reasons. But maybe the issue here is that he's holding Sofia to a standard he didn't follow for himself. In Catholic teachings, both partners are supposed to be chaste before marriage, right? But he didn't follow that himself. So maybe there's a contradiction there. \n\nHe says he married her for her personality and virginity. That part is his choice, but when he points out her virginity as a positive trait while having his own past, others might see that as double standards. His friend is pointing out that he's being hypocritical. \n\nIs it wrong to value a partner's virginity? That's a personal choice, but if he's holding others to a standard he doesn't meet, that's hypocritical. However, does that make him \"in the wrong\"? Maybe not, because personal preferences aren't inherently wrong. But if he's being judgmental about his own past while expecting his partner to uphold a standard he didn't, that's where the issue lies. \n\nAlso, the friend's reaction might be valid if she's pointing out the hypocrisy. But the friend isn't part of the marriage, so maybe his choice to marry Sofia is his own. However, the question is about whether he's in the wrong for stating his reasons, not Sofia's actions. \n\nIn terms of fairness, if he's being called a hypocrite, but his choice to marry her isn't harming anyone, maybe he isn't in the wrong. However, if he's projecting his own past actions onto his partner, that could be problematic. \n\nSo, the answer depends on whether hypocrisy equals being wrong. If hypocrisy is the issue but doesn't cause harm, then maybe not wrong. But if he's being judgmental or setting double standards, then maybe he is in the wrong. \n\nI think the key here is that while his reasons for marrying Sofia are his choice, the hypocrisy in his behavior (judging others for past actions he did himself) is the problem. So the answer might be A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because he's being hypocritical and projecting his own past actions onto his partner, which is a double standard. Alternatively, B (Not in the wrong) because personal preferences are his own, and as long as both parties are okay with it, it's not wrong. \n\nBut the friend's criticism is about hypocrisy. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being hypocritical. In social terms, hypocrisy can be seen as a moral failing, but it doesn't necessarily make him wrong for his choice. However, if he's being judgmental or double-standard, then yes. \n\nHmm. The question is whether he's in the wrong. If the act of choosing a partner based on their virginity, while he wasn't a virgin himself, is wrong. Legally or ethically, it's not inherently wrong. But morally, if he's being hypocritical, then maybe he's in the wrong for not holding himself to the same standard. But that's more about personal values than being \"in the wrong.\"\n\nSo the answer is likely B (No), because personal choice in partners isn't wrong, even if it's hypocritical. The friend's judgment is valid, but the author isn't in the wrong for those personal reasons. Unless there's a specific ethical breach, which there isn't. So B.\n"
