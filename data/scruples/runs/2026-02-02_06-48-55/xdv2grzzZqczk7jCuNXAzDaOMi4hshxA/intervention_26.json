Now I'll just call her Sofia. My my wife Sofia is beautiful, but most of all, she has a wonderful personality. She is reserved, incredibly kind hearted and mentally strong. She had all the qualities to make a great mother. (we're planning on trying for kids soon). She's Mexican and was born/raised there, and she is quite religious Cahtolic.\n\nNow I'm also Catholic as well, I come from an Irish American Cahtolic background. However it's more of a ''religious in name only'' sort of thing, I somewhat vaguely believe in a deity of some sorts but not really a strong belief in the scripture like my parents. \n\nAnyway, when I first started dating her, the first thing my mates said was literally ''Dude this woman is wifey material''. It became a bit of a running joke, ''wifey material''. \n\nShe seemed like the PERFECT woman and I was a bit persistant when I first met her but eventually she agreed to go on a date from me, from then on it was history because we did have a lot in common. So now we married but one of the reasons I married her, aside from her personality, was that she was a virgin. She didn't sleep around whatsoever, she held out for the ''right guy'' and that guy was me. \n\nSo when I was talking to my female friend (30F) I said that one of the reasons I wanted to marry her was because of her personality AND the fact that she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. I thought this was an okay view to hold but she called me a ''Fucking asshole'' because she pointed out that I slept around in my youth. \n\nIt's true, when I was in my early 20's, I did a lot of sleeping around and hookup culture. And I could have seen myself marrying those girls if I was left with no choice, but they were never my IDEAL choices for partners, so I feel like Sofia was a god send in that regard. My friend (20F) still said I was being a hypocrite however what right does she have to criticize my dating choices? AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for marrying his wife because she didn't sleep around, especially since he had a history of doing so. \n\nFirst, the author (30M) married Sofia (28F) after dating her. He mentions that one of the reasons he married her was her being a virgin and not sleeping around. However, he admits he had a history of sleeping around in his early 20s.\n\nHis friend called him an asshole for this, pointing out his hypocrisy. The author is now asking if he's the asshole (AITA) in this situation. The user thinks the author is in the wrong and wants to confirm.\n\nSo, the key points here are hypocrisy and double standards. The author is judging his wife for her sexual history while having his own. Even though his current beliefs might be more Catholic in name only, his actions during their relationship (choosing a virgin) might conflict with his own past behavior. \n\nReligiously, Catholicism does emphasize chastity before marriage, but the author isn't strictly following that. The hypocrisy comes from his personal standards versus his own history. By valuing Sofia's virginity while having slept around himself, he's applying a double standard. \n\nAlso, the friend's criticism is valid because personal standards should be consistent. If he's okay with his past, then holding a higher standard for a partner without personal alignment could be seen as unfair. \n\nMoreover, the author's reasoning for marrying her based on her virginity might not be fair to Sofia. She might not be aware of the importance he places on her sexual history, which could lead to issues in the future if she feels judged or if there are discrepancies in their values.\n\nIn terms of relationships, mutual respect and understanding are key. The author's actions might not be malicious, but the inconsistency in his standards could be problematic. The friend's reaction is a valid critique of his personal hypocrisy, which the author needs to reflect on.\n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong for holding a double standard and potentially disrespecting his own past and his wife's autonomy.\n"
