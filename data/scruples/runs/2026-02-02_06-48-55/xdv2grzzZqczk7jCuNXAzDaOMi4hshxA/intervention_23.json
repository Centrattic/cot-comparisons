Now I'll just call her Sofia. My my wife Sofia is beautiful, but most of all, she has a wonderful personality. She is reserved, incredibly kind hearted and mentally strong. She had all the qualities to make a great mother. (we're planning on trying for kids soon). She's Mexican and was born/raised there, and she is quite religious Cahtolic.\n\nNow I'm also Catholic as well, I come from an Irish American Cahtolic background. However it's more of a ''religious in name only'' sort of thing, I somewhat vaguely believe in a deity of some sorts but not really a strong belief in the scripture like my parents. \n\nAnyway, when I first started dating her, the first thing my mates said was literally ''Dude this woman is wifey material''. It became a bit of a running joke, ''wifey material''. \n\nShe seemed like the PERFECT woman and I was a bit persistant when I first met her but eventually she agreed to go on a date from me, from then on it was history because we did have a lot in common. So now we married but one of the reasons I married her, aside from her personality, was that she was a virgin. She didn't sleep around whatsoever, she held out for the ''right guy'' and that guy was me. \n\nSo when I was talking to my female friend (30F) I said that one of the reasons I wanted to marry her was because of her personality AND the fact that she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. I thought this was an okay view to hold but she called me a ''Fucking asshole'' because she pointed out that I slept around in my youth. \n\nIt's true, when I was in my early 20's, I did a lot of sleeping around and hookup culture. And I could have seen myself marrying those girls if I was left with no choice, but they were never my IDEAL choices for partners, so I feel like Sofia was a god send in that regard. My friend (20F) still said I was being a hypocrite however what right does she have to criticize my dating choices? AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about the author marrying a woman who was a virgin, even though he himself had a history of sleeping around in his youth. His friend called him an asshole for being hypocritical.\n\nSo, the main issue here is about hypocrisy. The author is pointing out that he married someone who didn't sleep around, but he had done the same in his past. The question is whether his actions make him wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the concept of double standards. If someone judges another for something they themselves have done, that's typically seen as hypocritical. The author is proud of marrying a virgin, which implies a certain standard, but he doesn't hold himself to that same standard. \n\nHowever, there's context here. The author mentions that he was in a different place in his life when he was sleeping around, and now he values someone who hasn't. Sofia's values align with his current desires, especially in terms of family and religion. But the problem arises when he criticizes his past self while not acknowledging that his past actions were his choice. \n\nThe friend's criticism is about the hypocrisy. The author's friend is pointing out that he's being inconsistent. Even though Sofia's choice to be a virgin might be her personal decision, the author's past behavior suggests that he didn't adhere to the same standard. So, by marrying someone who fits his current ideals while ignoring his own past, he's being judgmental towards his past self. \n\nAnother angle is personal growth. People can change over time, and maybe the author has matured. But that doesn't necessarily excuse the hypocrisy. It's about whether it's fair to hold someone else to a standard he himself didn't follow. \n\nAlso, the religious aspect comes into play. As both are Catholic, there's an expectation of certain moral standards. However, the author's own past actions contradict those standards, yet he's choosing a partner based on those same standards. This could be seen as judgmental towards Sofia's choices if he's applying religious standards selectively. \n\nBut the author isn't necessarily condemning Sofia for past actions; he's choosing to marry her based on her current values. The issue is more about his own past and his judgment of it versus hers. If Sofia chose to be a virgin, and he respects that, but he himself didn't follow that path, then his reasoning for marrying her based on that choice might be hypocritical if he's not honest about his own past. \n\nThe key point is the hypocrisy. By holding Sofia to a standard he himself didn't follow, he's being inconsistent. His friend is right to point out that he's a hypocrite. Even if his intentions are good, the inconsistency is there. \n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because he's applying a double standard. He can have his own reasons for valuing Sofia's virginity, but the fact that he's doing so while having a history of different behavior makes him hypocritical. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
