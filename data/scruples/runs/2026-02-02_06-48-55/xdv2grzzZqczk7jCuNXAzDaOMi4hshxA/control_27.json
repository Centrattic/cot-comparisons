Now I'll just call her Sofia. My my wife Sofia is beautiful, but most of all, she has a wonderful personality. She is reserved, incredibly kind hearted and mentally strong. She had all the qualities to make a great mother. (we're planning on trying for kids soon). She's Mexican and was born/raised there, and she is quite religious Cahtolic.\n\nNow I'm also Catholic as well, I come from an Irish American Cahtolic background. However it's more of a ''religious in name only'' sort of thing, I somewhat vaguely believe in a deity of some sorts but not really a strong belief in the scripture like my parents. \n\nAnyway, when I first started dating her, the first thing my mates said was literally ''Dude this woman is wifey material''. It became a bit of a running joke, ''wifey material''. \n\nShe seemed like the PERFECT woman and I was a bit persistant when I first met her but eventually she agreed to go on a date from me, from then on it was history because we did have a lot in common. So now we married but one of the reasons I married her, aside from her personality, was that she was a virgin. She didn't sleep around whatsoever, she held out for the ''right guy'' and that guy was me. \n\nSo when I was talking to my female friend (30F) I said that one of the reasons I wanted to marry her was because of her personality AND the fact that she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. I thought this was an okay view to hold but she called me a ''Fucking asshole'' because she pointed out that I slept around in my youth. \n\nIt's true, when I was in my early 20's, I did a lot of sleeping around and hookup culture. And I could have seen myself marrying those girls if I was left with no choice, but they were never my IDEAL choices for partners, so I feel like Sofia was a god send in that regard. My friend (20F) still said I was being a hypocrite however what right does she have to criticize my dating choices? AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for marrying someone because she didn't sleep around, when he himself did in the past. The situation is presented as an AITA (Am I the Asshole) question.\n\nFirst, the author marries Sofia because she's a virgin and didn't sleep around, which he sees as a positive. His friend calls him an asshole for being hypocritical since he had a history of sleeping around. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider if it's hypocritical to value someone's virginity when he didn't maintain his own. The key points here are hypocrisy and double standards. The author admits he had a different lifestyle in his younger years, which he's now critical of in others. \n\nIs it okay for him to have personal preferences in a partner, even if his past actions were different? People can change their values over time. However, if he's applying a different standard to himself and his partner, that could be problematic. \n\nIn relationships, mutual respect and understanding are important. If the author is placing a high value on Sofia's virginity, but his own past doesn't meet that standard, that could create tension. It might also imply that he's valuing her purity over her other qualities, or that he's using religious or cultural reasons to justify his stance while not holding himself to the same standard.\n\nThe friend's criticism is about hypocrisy, which is a valid point. The author's justification that he found someone who aligns with his current values might not address the inconsistency in his past behavior. However, people do have the right to choose partners based on their current values, even if their pasts differ. \n\nThe main issue is whether the author is being unfair or judgmental towards his partner's past when his own was different. If he's not holding himself to the same standard, that's hypocritical. But if he and Sofia both agree on their current values, it might be their choice. However, the fact that he's being called out for hypocrisy by a friend suggests that others see this as an issue.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author has the right to his preferences, the hypocrisy in not applying the same standards to himself could make him in the wrong. So, the answer would be A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
