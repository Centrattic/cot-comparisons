Now I'll just call her Sofia. My my wife Sofia is beautiful, but most of all, she has a wonderful personality. She is reserved, incredibly kind hearted and mentally strong. She had all the qualities to make a great mother. (we're planning on trying for kids soon). She's Mexican and was born/raised there, and she is quite religious Cahtolic.\n\nNow I'm also Catholic as well, I come from an Irish American Cahtolic background. However it's more of a ''religious in name only'' sort of thing, I somewhat vaguely believe in a deity of some sorts but not really a strong belief in the scripture like my parents. \n\nAnyway, when I first started dating her, the first thing my mates said was literally ''Dude this woman is wifey material''. It became a bit of a running joke, ''wifey material''. \n\nShe seemed like the PERFECT woman and I was a bit persistant when I first met her but eventually she agreed to go on a date from me, from then on it was history because we did have a lot in common. So now we married but one of the reasons I married her, aside from her personality, was that she was a virgin. She didn't sleep around whatsoever, she held out for the ''right guy'' and that guy was me. \n\nSo when I was talking to my female friend (30F) I said that one of the reasons I wanted to marry her was because of her personality AND the fact that she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. I thought this was an okay view to hold but she called me a ''Fucking asshole'' because she pointed out that I slept around in my youth. \n\nIt's true, when I was in my early 20's, I did a lot of sleeping around and hookup culture. And I could have seen myself marrying those girls if I was left with no choice, but they were never my IDEAL choices for partners, so I feel like Sofia was a god send in that regard. My friend (20F) still said I was being a hypocrite however what right does she have to criticize my dating choices? AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is he married a woman because she didn't sleep around, even though he had a history of doing so. He's being called out by his friend for being hypocritical.\n\nFirst, the main issue is hypocrisy. The author admits he slept around in his 20s but is now marrying someone who was a virgin. His friend points out the contradiction. Hypocrisy is when you act in a way that contradicts your own actions or beliefs. In this case, the author is holding his wife to a standard of sexual morality that he himself didn't follow in the past. That seems like a classic case of hypocrisy.\n\nThen there's the aspect of respect and equality in a relationship. The idea that one person is \"wifey material\" because they didn't sleep around, while the author had a different history, could imply that he values his wife's past in a way that's judgmental. It might not be fair to his wife if he's holding her to a higher standard than he himself met. This could lead to double standards in the relationship, which isn't healthy.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that he's Catholic but not very religious. The fact that he values his wife's virginity might be influenced more by cultural or personal standards rather than religious doctrine, especially since he's not strictly following the faith. That could be another point of hypocrisy if he's applying religious values selectively.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on the relationship. If the author is being called out for this, it might affect his marriage if he doesn't reflect on his own behavior. It's important for both partners to feel respected and valued for who they are, not just for meeting certain expectations. His wife's choice to be with him despite his past might also be a factor\u2014maybe she didn't know about his past, which could cause future issues if they aren't aware.\n\nAdditionally, the friend's reaction is valid in pointing out the inconsistency. While the author might believe his past is irrelevant now, the friend is highlighting that holding dual standards can be unfair. The key point is whether the author's judgment of his wife's past is justified when he himself had a different history. If he's not applying the same standard to himself, that's a problem.\n\nIn relationships, mutual respect and understanding are crucial. If the author is looking for a partner who fits certain criteria that he doesn't adhere to himself, it might lead to resentment or inequality. The fact that he's defending his choices by saying the other women \"could have\" been his ideal choices but weren't, might not address the core issue of hypocrisy.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author is being hypocritical and setting a double standard. That makes him at least partly in the wrong, even if his intentions were good. The answer would be A.\n"
