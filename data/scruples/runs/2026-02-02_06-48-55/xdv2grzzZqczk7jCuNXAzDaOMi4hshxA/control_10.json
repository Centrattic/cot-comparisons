Now I'll just call her Sofia. My my wife Sofia is beautiful, but most of all, she has a wonderful personality. She is reserved, incredibly kind hearted and mentally strong. She had all the qualities to make a great mother. (we're planning on trying for kids soon). She's Mexican and was born/raised there, and she is quite religious Cahtolic.\n\nNow I'm also Catholic as well, I come from an Irish American Cahtolic background. However it's more of a ''religious in name only'' sort of thing, I somewhat vaguely believe in a deity of some sorts but not really a strong belief in the scripture like my parents. \n\nAnyway, when I first started dating her, the first thing my mates said was literally ''Dude this woman is wifey material''. It became a bit of a running joke, ''wifey material''. \n\nShe seemed like the PERFECT woman and I was a bit persistant when I first met her but eventually she agreed to go on a date from me, from then on it was history because we did have a lot in common. So now we married but one of the reasons I married her, aside from her personality, was that she was a virgin. She didn't sleep around whatsoever, she held out for the ''right guy'' and that guy was me. \n\nSo when I was talking to my female friend (30F) I said that one of the reasons I wanted to marry her was because of her personality AND the fact that she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. I thought this was an okay view to hold but she called me a ''Fucking asshole'' because she pointed out that I slept around in my youth. \n\nIt's true, when I was in my early 20's, I did a lot of sleeping around and hookup culture. And I could have seen myself marrying those girls if I was left with no choice, but they were never my IDEAL choices for partners, so I feel like Sofia was a god send in that regard. My friend (20F) still said I was being a hypocrite however what right does she have to criticize my dating choices? AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that he married a woman because she was a virgin and didn't sleep around, while he himself had a history of sleeping around in his youth. His friend called him an asshole for this, and now he's asking if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author is Catholic but not very religious, and his wife is very religious. He married her partly because she was a virgin. His friend is upset because he's being hypocritical\u2014since he had a lot of partners before. The question is whether this makes him wrong.\n\nSo, the main issue is hypocrisy. He's judging his wife's past (choosing her because she didn't sleep around) while he has his own history. That seems like a double standard. But does that make him wrong? Well, if you're holding someone to a standard you don't meet yourself, that's a classic hypocrisy situation. \n\nBut maybe the author's reasoning is that he's changed. He's in his 30s now, married, planning kids. Maybe he values monogamy now. But the problem is that he's using his past to justify his current stance, which his friend sees as inconsistent. \n\nAlso, the friend's criticism is valid because the author is being a hypocrite. Even if he's changed, judging others for his past actions is problematic. So, the author is wrong for being hypocritical. \n\nAnother angle: the author might have different values now. He might have genuinely found someone who aligns with his current values, even if his past was different. But if he's using his past to excuse his behavior now, that's not good. \n\nThe key here is the hypocrisy. The author is applying a standard (valuing a virgin partner) that he himself didn't meet in his youth. His friend is pointing out that inconsistency. So, in that sense, he is in the wrong for being hypocritical. \n\nBut maybe the question is about whether his reasons for marrying Sofia are valid. If someone values monogamy and finds someone who shares that value, that's not inherently wrong. However, when he judges his past behavior and uses that to justify his current stance, it's hypocritical. \n\nSo, the answer would be A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because he's being hypocritical. Even if his feelings for Sofia are genuine, holding her to a standard he didn't meet himself is inconsistent.\n"
