Now I'll just call her Sofia. My my wife Sofia is beautiful, but most of all, she has a wonderful personality. She is reserved, incredibly kind hearted and mentally strong. She had all the qualities to make a great mother. (we're planning on trying for kids soon). She's Mexican and was born/raised there, and she is quite religious Cahtolic.\n\nNow I'm also Catholic as well, I come from an Irish American Cahtolic background. However it's more of a ''religious in name only'' sort of thing, I somewhat vaguely believe in a deity of some sorts but not really a strong belief in the scripture like my parents. \n\nAnyway, when I first started dating her, the first thing my mates said was literally ''Dude this woman is wifey material''. It became a bit of a running joke, ''wifey material''. \n\nShe seemed like the PERFECT woman and I was a bit persistant when I first met her but eventually she agreed to go on a date from me, from then on it was history because we did have a lot in common. So now we married but one of the reasons I married her, aside from her personality, was that she was a virgin. She didn't sleep around whatsoever, she held out for the ''right guy'' and that guy was me. \n\nSo when I was talking to my female friend (30F) I said that one of the reasons I wanted to marry her was because of her personality AND the fact that she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. I thought this was an okay view to hold but she called me a ''Fucking asshole'' because she pointed out that I slept around in my youth. \n\nIt's true, when I was in my early 20's, I did a lot of sleeping around and hookup culture. And I could have seen myself marrying those girls if I was left with no choice, but they were never my IDEAL choices for partners, so I feel like Sofia was a god send in that regard. My friend (20F) still said I was being a hypocrite however what right does she have to criticize my dating choices? AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for marrying someone because she didn't sleep around, especially when he himself did in the past.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author, a 30-year-old man, married a 28-year-old woman named Sofia. He values her being a virgin and not having slept around, which was a significant factor in his decision to marry her. However, he admits he had a history of sleeping around in his early 20s. His friend called him an asshole for this, pointing out the hypocrisy.\n\nSo, the key points here are hypocrisy and double standards. The author is judging Sofia's past sexual behavior while acknowledging his own past. He's using his current values to select a spouse but isn't holding himself to the same standard. The question is whether that makes him in the wrong.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, it's about consistency. If someone sets a standard for a partner's behavior, they should ideally apply the same standard to themselves. The fact that he himself engaged in the same behavior but now considers it bad for his wife could be seen as hypocritical. However, maybe he's changed his views over time. But the problem is that he's holding her to a standard he no longer holds himself to, which can be seen as unfair or judgmental.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of \"wifey material\" and virginity. Societally, there's an assumption that men should be more sexually active, while women are expected to be pure. By valuing her virginity so much, even though he didn't uphold that himself, he's reinforcing a double standard. That could be seen as sexist or unfair.\n\nThen there's the issue of communication. The author didn't realize that his comments would be offensive until his friend told him. This shows a lack of awareness about how his actions and words affect others, especially from a gender perspective. His friend's criticism is valid because he's essentially being a hypocrite.\n\nHowever, the author might argue that he's changed and Sofia was his ideal choice, which is why he's not in the wrong. But the fact remains that he's applying different standards to his wife and himself, which is problematic.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author is in the wrong because he's holding his wife to a standard he doesn't hold himself to, which is hypocritical and promotes a double standard. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
