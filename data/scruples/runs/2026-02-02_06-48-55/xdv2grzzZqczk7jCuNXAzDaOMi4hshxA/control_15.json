Now I'll just call her Sofia. My my wife Sofia is beautiful, but most of all, she has a wonderful personality. She is reserved, incredibly kind hearted and mentally strong. She had all the qualities to make a great mother. (we're planning on trying for kids soon). She's Mexican and was born/raised there, and she is quite religious Cahtolic.\n\nNow I'm also Catholic as well, I come from an Irish American Cahtolic background. However it's more of a ''religious in name only'' sort of thing, I somewhat vaguely believe in a deity of some sorts but not really a strong belief in the scripture like my parents. \n\nAnyway, when I first started dating her, the first thing my mates said was literally ''Dude this woman is wifey material''. It became a bit of a running joke, ''wifey material''. \n\nShe seemed like the PERFECT woman and I was a bit persistant when I first met her but eventually she agreed to go on a date from me, from then on it was history because we did have a lot in common. So now we married but one of the reasons I married her, aside from her personality, was that she was a virgin. She didn't sleep around whatsoever, she held out for the ''right guy'' and that guy was me. \n\nSo when I was talking to my female friend (30F) I said that one of the reasons I wanted to marry her was because of her personality AND the fact that she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. I thought this was an okay view to hold but she called me a ''Fucking asshole'' because she pointed out that I slept around in my youth. \n\nIt's true, when I was in my early 20's, I did a lot of sleeping around and hookup culture. And I could have seen myself marrying those girls if I was left with no choice, but they were never my IDEAL choices for partners, so I feel like Sofia was a god send in that regard. My friend (20F) still said I was being a hypocrite however what right does she have to criticize my dating choices? AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for the situation described. The author married a woman who was a virgin and didn't sleep around, but he had a history of sleeping around in his youth. His friend criticized him for being hypocritical.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author mentions that one of the reasons he married Sofia was her being a virgin. However, he admits he had a history of hooking up with others. The friend points out the hypocrisy, which the author is defending by saying those past partners weren't his ideal choices.\n\nThe central issue here is hypocrisy. He's choosing a partner based on her sexual history while he has his own past. Whether this is wrong depends on societal views on double standards. Some might argue that holding someone to a standard he himself doesn't meet is unfair. Others might say it's his choice as long as both parties are consenting adults.\n\nReligious context: Both are Catholic, but the author isn't strictly religious. His wife is more devout. Maybe the author's reasons are influenced by her religious values, but he's admitting he's not as strict in his beliefs. That could complicate things, as he's adopting her values but not fully adhering to them himself.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for being hypocritical. Hypocrisy isn't necessarily a moral wrong unless it causes harm. If Sofia is okay with his reasons and they're happy, maybe it's not the author's fault. But if he's judging others (like his friend) for pointing out his inconsistency, that's where the problem might lie.\n\nAnother angle: The author's friend's right to criticize. The friend isn't part of their relationship, so her criticism might be outside her bounds. But the author's own actions\u2014valuing his wife's virginity while he had a different past\u2014could be seen as double standards. However, it's his personal choice unless it's causing harm to his wife.\n\nWait, does the author's reasoning affect Sofia? If he married her based on her not sleeping around, but he himself had a history, is that fair to her? The key is whether Sofia is aware and consents. Since they married, it's implied she's okay with it. So maybe the wrong isn't towards her, but rather the author's hypocrisy in how he views others versus himself.\n\nThe friend called him an asshole for being hypocritical. The author is defending his choice by saying those past partners weren't his ideal choices. But the friend's point is that he's inconsistent. Is inconsistency a moral failing? It might not be, but it's a valid critique. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for being hypocritical. If the answer hinges on hypocrisy being a moral wrong, then maybe A (yes). But if personal choice and not harming others is the main concern, then B (no).\n\nI think the answer depends on societal norms versus individual freedom. Since the author isn't harming anyone and both parties are consenting, it's more about personal values. However, the hypocrisy is there, but that doesn't necessarily make him wrong in a moral sense. The friend's criticism is valid, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for his own choices. So the answer might be B (no).\n"
