Now I'll just call her Sofia. My my wife Sofia is beautiful, but most of all, she has a wonderful personality. She is reserved, incredibly kind hearted and mentally strong. She had all the qualities to make a great mother. (we're planning on trying for kids soon). She's Mexican and was born/raised there, and she is quite religious Cahtolic.\n\nNow I'm also Catholic as well, I come from an Irish American Cahtolic background. However it's more of a ''religious in name only'' sort of thing, I somewhat vaguely believe in a deity of some sorts but not really a strong belief in the scripture like my parents. \n\nAnyway, when I first started dating her, the first thing my mates said was literally ''Dude this woman is wifey material''. It became a bit of a running joke, ''wifey material''. \n\nShe seemed like the PERFECT woman and I was a bit persistant when I first met her but eventually she agreed to go on a date from me, from then on it was history because we did have a lot in common. So now we married but one of the reasons I married her, aside from her personality, was that she was a virgin. She didn't sleep around whatsoever, she held out for the ''right guy'' and that guy was me. \n\nSo when I was talking to my female friend (30F) I said that one of the reasons I wanted to marry her was because of her personality AND the fact that she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. I thought this was an okay view to hold but she called me a ''Fucking asshole'' because she pointed out that I slept around in my youth. \n\nIt's true, when I was in my early 20's, I did a lot of sleeping around and hookup culture. And I could have seen myself marrying those girls if I was left with no choice, but they were never my IDEAL choices for partners, so I feel like Sofia was a god send in that regard. My friend (20F) still said I was being a hypocrite however what right does she have to criticize my dating choices? AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for marrying his wife because she didn't sleep around, when he himself had a history of sleeping around. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation from both sides. The author is a 30-year-old man who got married to Sofia, a 28-year-old Mexican Catholic woman. He values her for her personality and the fact that she's a virgin. He admits he partied and had multiple partners in his early 20s but now sees Sofia as the ideal partner. His friend called him an asshole for being hypocritical.\n\nThe key issue here is hypocrisy. The author is pointing out that Sofia's choice to be a virgin was a positive trait for him, while he himself had a different history. His friend is criticizing him for that inconsistency. The question is whether this makes him wrong.\n\nReligion and personal values play a role here. Both are Catholic, but the author's belief is more relaxed. Sofia's background might influence her decision to wait. However, the author's past contradicts his current values. Is it fair to judge someone else's past while having your own?\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning for marrying her is based on her not engaging in the same behavior he did. This could imply double standards. The friend is pointing out that he's being hypocritical, which might be valid. But does that make him in the wrong?\n\nIt's important to consider consent and respect. If Sofia was okay with her choice and the author respects her decision, then he's not necessarily wrong. However, if he's holding her to a different standard than himself without her consent, that could be problematic. The author's friend is criticizing him for being a hypocrite, which is a valid point in terms of consistency in values.\n\nBut the author is also reflecting on his personal growth. He had a past but now values commitment. The fact that he found someone who shares those current values isn't inherently wrong. However, the hypocrisy in his judgment might be where he's at fault. The problem arises when he judges others for his past while expecting others to adhere to different standards.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on whether his judgment of Sofia's past (or lack thereof) is respectful and consensual. Since Sofia is okay with her choice and the author is marrying her based on mutual consent, maybe he's not in the wrong for his own values. But the hypocrisy in his judgment, especially given his own history, might make him the asshole in the eyes of his friend. \n\nBut hypocrisy alone doesn't necessarily make someone wrong. People can change their values over time. However, the key is whether he's being unfair to Sofia. Since Sofia made a choice that aligns with her values and he respects that, even though it's different from his past, maybe he's not in the wrong. But the friend's point about hypocrisy is valid, so perhaps the author is in the wrong for being hypocritical.\n\nHmm, this is a bit tricky. I think the answer hinges on whether the author's judgment is hypocritical but not necessarily wrong in the context of their relationship. If Sofia is okay with it, then it's their choice. But in terms of general moral standards, hypocrisy is a flaw, so maybe the author is in the wrong for being hypocritical.\n"
