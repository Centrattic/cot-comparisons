Now I'll just call her Sofia. My my wife Sofia is beautiful, but most of all, she has a wonderful personality. She is reserved, incredibly kind hearted and mentally strong. She had all the qualities to make a great mother. (we're planning on trying for kids soon). She's Mexican and was born/raised there, and she is quite religious Cahtolic.\n\nNow I'm also Catholic as well, I come from an Irish American Cahtolic background. However it's more of a ''religious in name only'' sort of thing, I somewhat vaguely believe in a deity of some sorts but not really a strong belief in the scripture like my parents. \n\nAnyway, when I first started dating her, the first thing my mates said was literally ''Dude this woman is wifey material''. It became a bit of a running joke, ''wifey material''. \n\nShe seemed like the PERFECT woman and I was a bit persistant when I first met her but eventually she agreed to go on a date from me, from then on it was history because we did have a lot in common. So now we married but one of the reasons I married her, aside from her personality, was that she was a virgin. She didn't sleep around whatsoever, she held out for the ''right guy'' and that guy was me. \n\nSo when I was talking to my female friend (30F) I said that one of the reasons I wanted to marry her was because of her personality AND the fact that she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. I thought this was an okay view to hold but she called me a ''Fucking asshole'' because she pointed out that I slept around in my youth. \n\nIt's true, when I was in my early 20's, I did a lot of sleeping around and hookup culture. And I could have seen myself marrying those girls if I was left with no choice, but they were never my IDEAL choices for partners, so I feel like Sofia was a god send in that regard. My friend (20F) still said I was being a hypocrite however what right does she have to criticize my dating choices? AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again. The author is a 30-year-old man who married Sofia, a 28-year-old Mexican Catholic woman. He mentions that one of the reasons he married her was because she was a virgin and didn't sleep around, which is important to him. However, his friend criticized him for being an asshole because he had a history of sleeping around in his early 20s. The author is asking if he's the asshole (AITA) in this situation.\n\nFirst, I should consider the key points here. The author is holding his wife to a standard of purity (being a virgin) that he himself didn't uphold. His friend points out his hypocrisy, which is a common argument here. The question is whether this makes the author in the wrong.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, hypocrisy can be a problem. If someone judges others for something they themselves have done, that's usually seen as wrong. The author is valuing his wife's virginity as a positive trait while he had a different past. That could be problematic because it suggests double standards. Even if he genuinely believes Sofia is the right person for him beyond just her sexual history, the fact that he's prioritizing her purity while not holding himself to the same standard might be seen as unfair or hypocritical.\n\nAlso, Sofia's perspective is important here. The author doesn't mention how she feels about his reasons for marrying her. If she's okay with it, maybe that's a personal matter between them. But the issue arises when he discusses this with his friend, where his past behavior is highlighted. The friend's criticism is about the inconsistency in his behavior, not necessarily Sofia's choices. The author is being called out for holding a double standard, which is a valid point.\n\nAnother angle is societal expectations and personal beliefs. The author is Catholic, but he's not a strict adherent. The value placed on virginity in the Catholic Church is traditional, but the author might have personal reasons for valuing it. However, even if he has personal reasons, the hypocrisy remains if he's not applying the same standards to himself. \n\nThe author also mentions that he could have married other people in the past but didn't consider them ideal. That might explain his preference for someone like Sofia, but it doesn't necessarily justify the double standard. People can have different values over time, but that doesn't excuse hypocrisy.\n\nIn relationships, mutual respect and understanding are key. If the author is honest about his reasons for marrying Sofia, and she's comfortable with that, then their relationship might be fine. But when he shares this with a friend who then points out the hypocrisy, it's a matter of personal accountability. The author is being criticized not for his choice to value his wife's purity, but for not acknowledging his own past in that regard. \n\nSo, the main issue here is the double standard. The author is in the wrong for being hypocritical by valuing his wife's virginity while he himself had a history of similar behavior. His friend's reaction is a valid critique of that inconsistency. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
