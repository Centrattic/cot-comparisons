Now I'll just call her Sofia. My my wife Sofia is beautiful, but most of all, she has a wonderful personality. She is reserved, incredibly kind hearted and mentally strong. She had all the qualities to make a great mother. (we're planning on trying for kids soon). She's Mexican and was born/raised there, and she is quite religious Cahtolic.\n\nNow I'm also Catholic as well, I come from an Irish American Cahtolic background. However it's more of a ''religious in name only'' sort of thing, I somewhat vaguely believe in a deity of some sorts but not really a strong belief in the scripture like my parents. \n\nAnyway, when I first started dating her, the first thing my mates said was literally ''Dude this woman is wifey material''. It became a bit of a running joke, ''wifey material''. \n\nShe seemed like the PERFECT woman and I was a bit persistant when I first met her but eventually she agreed to go on a date from me, from then on it was history because we did have a lot in common. So now we married but one of the reasons I married her, aside from her personality, was that she was a virgin. She didn't sleep around whatsoever, she held out for the ''right guy'' and that guy was me. \n\nSo when I was talking to my female friend (30F) I said that one of the reasons I wanted to marry her was because of her personality AND the fact that she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. I thought this was an okay view to hold but she called me a ''Fucking asshole'' because she pointed out that I slept around in my youth. \n\nIt's true, when I was in my early 20's, I did a lot of sleeping around and hookup culture. And I could have seen myself marrying those girls if I was left with no choice, but they were never my IDEAL choices for partners, so I feel like Sofia was a god send in that regard. My friend (20F) still said I was being a hypocrite however what right does she have to criticize my dating choices? AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for marrying someone because she didn't sleep around, especially since he had a history of doing so. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author is a 30-year-old man who married a 28-year-old woman named Sofia. He values her personality and the fact that she was a virgin. His friend criticized him for being hypocritical because he had a history of sleeping around in his early 20s.\n\nThe key points here are hypocrisy and double standards. The author is now valuing Sofia's purity, but he himself wasn't a virgin when they married. His friend's reaction is based on that inconsistency. \n\nIs it wrong to value a partner's virginity if you haven't maintained that standard yourself? That's a moral question. In some cultures or religions, virginity is highly valued, but the author mentions he's Catholic in name only and doesn't strictly follow the teachings. His friend points out the hypocrisy, which is a valid point. \n\nThe author argues that Sofia was his ideal choice despite his past, but the friend's criticism is about the inconsistency. So, is it wrong to prefer a partner who hasn't slept around if you have? It could be seen as hypocritical, which might make the author in the wrong. \n\nHowever, personal preferences in a relationship are subjective. The author might feel that his past is behind him, and he's made a conscious choice to marry someone who aligns with his current values. But the issue arises when he's holding his partner to a standard he himself didn't meet. That's where hypocrisy comes in. \n\nThe friend's right to criticize might depend on their relationship, but in terms of the situation, the author's reasoning for marrying Sofia could be problematic. It's not just about his past but about the double standard he's applying. \n\nTherefore, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because of the hypocrisy in expecting a standard from his partner that he himself didn't uphold.\n"
