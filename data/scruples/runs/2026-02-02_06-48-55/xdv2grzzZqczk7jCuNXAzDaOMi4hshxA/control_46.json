Now I'll just call her Sofia. My my wife Sofia is beautiful, but most of all, she has a wonderful personality. She is reserved, incredibly kind hearted and mentally strong. She had all the qualities to make a great mother. (we're planning on trying for kids soon). She's Mexican and was born/raised there, and she is quite religious Cahtolic.\n\nNow I'm also Catholic as well, I come from an Irish American Cahtolic background. However it's more of a ''religious in name only'' sort of thing, I somewhat vaguely believe in a deity of some sorts but not really a strong belief in the scripture like my parents. \n\nAnyway, when I first started dating her, the first thing my mates said was literally ''Dude this woman is wifey material''. It became a bit of a running joke, ''wifey material''. \n\nShe seemed like the PERFECT woman and I was a bit persistant when I first met her but eventually she agreed to go on a date from me, from then on it was history because we did have a lot in common. So now we married but one of the reasons I married her, aside from her personality, was that she was a virgin. She didn't sleep around whatsoever, she held out for the ''right guy'' and that guy was me. \n\nSo when I was talking to my female friend (30F) I said that one of the reasons I wanted to marry her was because of her personality AND the fact that she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. I thought this was an okay view to hold but she called me a ''Fucking asshole'' because she pointed out that I slept around in my youth. \n\nIt's true, when I was in my early 20's, I did a lot of sleeping around and hookup culture. And I could have seen myself marrying those girls if I was left with no choice, but they were never my IDEAL choices for partners, so I feel like Sofia was a god send in that regard. My friend (20F) still said I was being a hypocrite however what right does she have to criticize my dating choices? AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for marrying someone because she didn't sleep around, even though he did in his youth. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author married Sofia because she was a virgin and didn't have a lot of sexual partners. He values her purity and sees her as the right choice. On the other hand, he admits he had a history of casual relationships in his early 20s. His friend called him an asshole for being hypocritical.\n\nSo, the main question is about hypocrisy. Did he do something wrong by valuing his wife's purity while having a past where he wasn't as pure? \n\nFrom a moral perspective, hypocrisy is when someone's actions don't align with their stated beliefs or standards. Here, the author is holding a double standard. He had a different past but now expects his partner to adhere to a higher standard. Whether that's wrong depends on cultural and personal values. In some contexts, especially religious ones, valuing a partner's purity might be traditional. However, the hypocrisy comes into play when he criticizes his past behavior while expecting his wife to follow a different path.\n\nThe friend's criticism is valid because the author is inconsistent. But does that make him in the wrong? It might depend on the intention. If the author is being judgmental or double standards, then yes. However, if he's grown and changed his views over time, maybe not. The key is whether he's being unfair to his wife by holding her to a standard he didn't follow himself.\n\nAlso, Sofia's perspective is important. If she's okay with it and they're happy, maybe it's not his fault. But the issue arises when he shares this with his friend and gets called out. The hypocrisy is in his justification based on his own past.\n\nIn many modern relationships, double standards in sexual morality are frowned upon. The fact that he's a Catholic but not strictly religious complicates it. His friend's criticism points out the inconsistency. So, while the author might not be malicious, his actions are hypocritical, which could be seen as being in the wrong.\n"
