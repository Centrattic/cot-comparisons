Now I'll just call her Sofia. My my wife Sofia is beautiful, but most of all, she has a wonderful personality. She is reserved, incredibly kind hearted and mentally strong. She had all the qualities to make a great mother. (we're planning on trying for kids soon). She's Mexican and was born/raised there, and she is quite religious Cahtolic.\n\nNow I'm also Catholic as well, I come from an Irish American Cahtolic background. However it's more of a ''religious in name only'' sort of thing, I somewhat vaguely believe in a deity of some sorts but not really a strong belief in the scripture like my parents. \n\nAnyway, when I first started dating her, the first thing my mates said was literally ''Dude this woman is wifey material''. It became a bit of a running joke, ''wifey material''. \n\nShe seemed like the PERFECT woman and I was a bit persistant when I first met her but eventually she agreed to go on a date from me, from then on it was history because we did have a lot in common. So now we married but one of the reasons I married her, aside from her personality, was that she was a virgin. She didn't sleep around whatsoever, she held out for the ''right guy'' and that guy was me. \n\nSo when I was talking to my female friend (30F) I said that one of the reasons I wanted to marry her was because of her personality AND the fact that she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. I thought this was an okay view to hold but she called me a ''Fucking asshole'' because she pointed out that I slept around in my youth. \n\nIt's true, when I was in my early 20's, I did a lot of sleeping around and hookup culture. And I could have seen myself marrying those girls if I was left with no choice, but they were never my IDEAL choices for partners, so I feel like Sofia was a god send in that regard. My friend (20F) still said I was being a hypocrite however what right does she have to criticize my dating choices? AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is whether it's acceptable for him to marry someone who didn't sleep around when he himself did in his youth.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that he married Sofia partly because she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. His friend called him an asshole because he had slept around in his past. So, the friend is pointing out a hypocrisy. The author argues that while he did have a lot of partners in his early 20s, those women weren't his ideal choices, and Sofia was a better match. \n\nI need to consider whether holding someone to a standard he himself didn't meet is unfair. The key point here is hypocrisy. If he judges Sofia for her past (being a virgin) while he himself had a more active past, is that double standards? The author's friend is criticizing him for that. \n\nAnother angle is personal choice. The author is entitled to his own preferences in a partner. If he values chastity and Sofia aligns with that, maybe it's his right to choose her. But the issue arises when his past actions conflict with the standards he's applying to his spouse. \n\nReligious context: Both are Catholic, so the author's background might influence his values. However, he mentions his belief is more nominal. So maybe his standards aren't strictly religious but personal. \n\nThe friend's criticism is about hypocrisy. The author's argument is that his past choices don't make him a hypocrite because those relationships were not ideal. But the fact remains he's applying different standards to himself and his wife. \n\nIs it wrong to have different expectations for oneself and a partner? That's subjective. However, hypocrisy exists when one applies different standards to others than to oneself. If the author is okay with his own past but not hers, that's hypocritical regardless of his reasoning. \n\nBut the author could also argue that personal growth matters. He changed his ways and now values a more committed partner. However, the issue is not about his current behavior but the judgment of his wife's past. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's personal choice to marry Sofia is his own, the hypocrisy in judging her past while accepting his own might make him in the wrong. The friend's criticism about hypocrisy is valid here.\n"
