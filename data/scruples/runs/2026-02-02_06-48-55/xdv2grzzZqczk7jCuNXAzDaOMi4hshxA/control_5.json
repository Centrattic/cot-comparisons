Now I'll just call her Sofia. My my wife Sofia is beautiful, but most of all, she has a wonderful personality. She is reserved, incredibly kind hearted and mentally strong. She had all the qualities to make a great mother. (we're planning on trying for kids soon). She's Mexican and was born/raised there, and she is quite religious Cahtolic.\n\nNow I'm also Catholic as well, I come from an Irish American Cahtolic background. However it's more of a ''religious in name only'' sort of thing, I somewhat vaguely believe in a deity of some sorts but not really a strong belief in the scripture like my parents. \n\nAnyway, when I first started dating her, the first thing my mates said was literally ''Dude this woman is wifey material''. It became a bit of a running joke, ''wifey material''. \n\nShe seemed like the PERFECT woman and I was a bit persistant when I first met her but eventually she agreed to go on a date from me, from then on it was history because we did have a lot in common. So now we married but one of the reasons I married her, aside from her personality, was that she was a virgin. She didn't sleep around whatsoever, she held out for the ''right guy'' and that guy was me. \n\nSo when I was talking to my female friend (30F) I said that one of the reasons I wanted to marry her was because of her personality AND the fact that she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. I thought this was an okay view to hold but she called me a ''Fucking asshole'' because she pointed out that I slept around in my youth. \n\nIt's true, when I was in my early 20's, I did a lot of sleeping around and hookup culture. And I could have seen myself marrying those girls if I was left with no choice, but they were never my IDEAL choices for partners, so I feel like Sofia was a god send in that regard. My friend (20F) still said I was being a hypocrite however what right does she have to criticize my dating choices? AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about someone marrying a woman because she didn't sleep around, even though he himself had a history of doing so. \n\nFirst, the author mentions that one of the reasons he married Sofia is her being a virgin and not engaging in casual relationships. He contrasts this with his past behavior where he slept around in his early 20s. His friend criticizes him for being a hypocrite, calling him an asshole. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, hypocrisy is a key point here. The author judges his wife's sexual history but has his own past. He's choosing a partner based on her sexual purity, possibly expecting her to meet a standard he himself didn't uphold. That could be seen as double standards. However, people can change their values over time. He might have mellowed out and now values monogamy, which is why he chose Sofia. But the fact that he's proud of her not sleeping around while he did might still be hypocritical.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of \"wifely material\" and the friend's reaction. The author's friend points out the hypocrisy, which is valid because he's holding his wife to a standard he didn't hold himself to. The friend's criticism is about the fairness of his judgment. If the author was okay with past partners who were more liberal, but now wants his wife to be chaste, that's inconsistent.\n\nAlso, the author's Catholic background might influence his views. His wife is Catholic and a virgin, which aligns with religious values, but the author's own religious beliefs are more nominal. So, maybe he's projecting his own changed values onto her, which could be problematic if he's not holding himself to the same standards.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, it's about whether double standards are acceptable. If the author is comfortable with his past but holds a different standard for his spouse, that could be seen as unfair. The friend's criticism is about hypocrisy, which is a valid point. The author might be in the wrong for having a double standard, even if his reasons are based on personal growth or finding a partner who fits his current ideals.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could argue that his past doesn't affect his current relationship, and he's free to choose a partner based on his current values. But the hypocrisy is in his judgment of others. The friend isn't in a position to judge his relationship, but pointing out the contradiction in his values is a fair critique.\n\nIn summary, the author's actions show a double standard. He's holding his wife to a standard he himself didn't meet, which is hypocritical. Therefore, he might be in the wrong. But if he's changed his views and his wife's standards align with his current values, maybe it's not entirely his fault. However, the hypocrisy is still there, so the answer would likely be A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
