Now I'll just call her Sofia. My my wife Sofia is beautiful, but most of all, she has a wonderful personality. She is reserved, incredibly kind hearted and mentally strong. She had all the qualities to make a great mother. (we're planning on trying for kids soon). She's Mexican and was born/raised there, and she is quite religious Cahtolic.\n\nNow I'm also Catholic as well, I come from an Irish American Cahtolic background. However it's more of a ''religious in name only'' sort of thing, I somewhat vaguely believe in a deity of some sorts but not really a strong belief in the scripture like my parents. \n\nAnyway, when I first started dating her, the first thing my mates said was literally ''Dude this woman is wifey material''. It became a bit of a running joke, ''wifey material''. \n\nShe seemed like the PERFECT woman and I was a bit persistant when I first met her but eventually she agreed to go on a date from me, from then on it was history because we did have a lot in common. So now we married but one of the reasons I married her, aside from her personality, was that she was a virgin. She didn't sleep around whatsoever, she held out for the ''right guy'' and that guy was me. \n\nSo when I was talking to my female friend (30F) I said that one of the reasons I wanted to marry her was because of her personality AND the fact that she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. I thought this was an okay view to hold but she called me a ''Fucking asshole'' because she pointed out that I slept around in my youth. \n\nIt's true, when I was in my early 20's, I did a lot of sleeping around and hookup culture. And I could have seen myself marrying those girls if I was left with no choice, but they were never my IDEAL choices for partners, so I feel like Sofia was a god send in that regard. My friend (20F) still said I was being a hypocrite however what right does she have to criticize my dating choices? AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for marrying his wife because she didn't sleep around, given that he himself had a history of doing so.\n\nFirst, the author's perspective: He married Sofia partly because she was a virgin and didn't engage in casual relationships, which he found appealing. He mentions he had a history of sleeping around in his early 20s but now considers Sofia a better, more ideal partner. His friend criticized him as hypocritical, leading to the AITA question.\n\nKey points to consider:\n1. **Hypocrisy**: The author is judging his wife's past sexual behavior (valuing her chastity) while having his own history of promiscuity. This could be seen as hypocritical because he holds her to a standard he himself didn't meet. Hypocrisy often arises when one applies different standards to others versus oneself.\n2. **Double Standards**: If someone criticizes others for something they themselves have done, it's a classic double standard. The author's friend points this out, suggesting he's unfair in his judgment of Sofia's past.\n3. **Personal Choice vs. Judgment**: The author has the right to choose his spouse based on personal preferences. However, the issue arises when he criticizes her past actions, implying that her value is tied to her sexual history. This can be problematic as it may place undue moral judgment on her.\n4. **Religious Context**: Both are Catholic, though the author's faith is more nominal. The emphasis on chastity might stem from religious values, but if the author isn't adhering to those same values, it could create inconsistency in expectations.\n5. **Friend's Criticism**: The friend called him an asshole for being hypocritical. Whether she's right depends on whether the author is indeed holding a double standard. If he's using his past to justify his current behavior while condemning hers, that's hypocritical.\n\nArguments for the author being in the wrong:\n- He's holding Sofia to a standard (chastity) that he himself didn't meet, which is hypocritical.\n- Judging someone else's past behavior based on one's own history isn't fair and can be seen as morally inconsistent.\n\nArguments for the author not being in the wrong:\n- Everyone has different values and personal preferences in choosing a partner. The author's choice is a personal matter unless it harms Sofia.\n- The friend's criticism might be too quick to judge the author's intentions without understanding his personal growth or current values.\n\nHowever, the key issue is the double standard. If the author is using his own past to justify his behavior while holding Sofia to a higher standard, that's where the problem lies. Intentions matter here\u2014if he's genuinely changed and now values fidelity in a partner, but his past doesn't disqualify him from valuing these traits in others. The problem is more about being hypocritical in judgment rather than hypocrisy in his current relationship.\n\nSo, considering the friend's point about hypocrisy, the author is in the wrong because he's applying a standard he himself didn't meet. Therefore, Answer A (Yes) would be the conclusion.\n"
