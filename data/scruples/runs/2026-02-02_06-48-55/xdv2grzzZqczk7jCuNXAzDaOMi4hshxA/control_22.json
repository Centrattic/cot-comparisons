Now I'll just call her Sofia. My my wife Sofia is beautiful, but most of all, she has a wonderful personality. She is reserved, incredibly kind hearted and mentally strong. She had all the qualities to make a great mother. (we're planning on trying for kids soon). She's Mexican and was born/raised there, and she is quite religious Cahtolic.\n\nNow I'm also Catholic as well, I come from an Irish American Cahtolic background. However it's more of a ''religious in name only'' sort of thing, I somewhat vaguely believe in a deity of some sorts but not really a strong belief in the scripture like my parents. \n\nAnyway, when I first started dating her, the first thing my mates said was literally ''Dude this woman is wifey material''. It became a bit of a running joke, ''wifey material''. \n\nShe seemed like the PERFECT woman and I was a bit persistant when I first met her but eventually she agreed to go on a date from me, from then on it was history because we did have a lot in common. So now we married but one of the reasons I married her, aside from her personality, was that she was a virgin. She didn't sleep around whatsoever, she held out for the ''right guy'' and that guy was me. \n\nSo when I was talking to my female friend (30F) I said that one of the reasons I wanted to marry her was because of her personality AND the fact that she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. I thought this was an okay view to hold but she called me a ''Fucking asshole'' because she pointed out that I slept around in my youth. \n\nIt's true, when I was in my early 20's, I did a lot of sleeping around and hookup culture. And I could have seen myself marrying those girls if I was left with no choice, but they were never my IDEAL choices for partners, so I feel like Sofia was a god send in that regard. My friend (20F) still said I was being a hypocrite however what right does she have to criticize my dating choices? AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for marrying someone because she was a virgin and didn't sleep around, while he had a history of sleeping around. \n\nFirst, the author is a 30-year-old man who married Sofia, a 28-year-old Catholic woman. He mentions that one of the reasons he married her was her virginity. He also had a past where he was involved in a lot of casual relationships. His friend criticized him for being hypocritical.\n\nSo, the key points here are the author's past behavior versus his current standards. He's being called out for holding double standards. The question is whether that makes him in the wrong.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, consistency matters. If he's using his past to judge others, there's a contradiction. He's choosing a partner based on her sexual history while he has his own. This could be seen as hypocritical, which his friend pointed out. \n\nBut then, personal values and beliefs vary. The author might believe that his past was different, perhaps due to different stages in life. He might argue that he's grown and now values commitment more. However, others might see it as unfair to hold a different standard for himself than for others.\n\nAlso, the context of their relationship's success is important. If Sofia is happy and they're planning kids, maybe the focus is on their current relationship rather than past actions. But the issue here is about the author's justification and whether it's valid.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, hypocrisy is often viewed negatively. The author is being called out for not applying the same standards to himself. Even if he's changed, using his past as an excuse might not negate the criticism. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because of the hypocrisy. However, some might argue that personal growth justifies different standards now. But the key point is the double standard he's applying, which his friend criticized.\n"
