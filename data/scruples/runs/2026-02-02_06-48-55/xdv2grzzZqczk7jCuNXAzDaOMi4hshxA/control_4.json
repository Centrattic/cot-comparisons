Now I'll just call her Sofia. My my wife Sofia is beautiful, but most of all, she has a wonderful personality. She is reserved, incredibly kind hearted and mentally strong. She had all the qualities to make a great mother. (we're planning on trying for kids soon). She's Mexican and was born/raised there, and she is quite religious Cahtolic.\n\nNow I'm also Catholic as well, I come from an Irish American Cahtolic background. However it's more of a ''religious in name only'' sort of thing, I somewhat vaguely believe in a deity of some sorts but not really a strong belief in the scripture like my parents. \n\nAnyway, when I first started dating her, the first thing my mates said was literally ''Dude this woman is wifey material''. It became a bit of a running joke, ''wifey material''. \n\nShe seemed like the PERFECT woman and I was a bit persistant when I first met her but eventually she agreed to go on a date from me, from then on it was history because we did have a lot in common. So now we married but one of the reasons I married her, aside from her personality, was that she was a virgin. She didn't sleep around whatsoever, she held out for the ''right guy'' and that guy was me. \n\nSo when I was talking to my female friend (30F) I said that one of the reasons I wanted to marry her was because of her personality AND the fact that she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. I thought this was an okay view to hold but she called me a ''Fucking asshole'' because she pointed out that I slept around in my youth. \n\nIt's true, when I was in my early 20's, I did a lot of sleeping around and hookup culture. And I could have seen myself marrying those girls if I was left with no choice, but they were never my IDEAL choices for partners, so I feel like Sofia was a god send in that regard. My friend (20F) still said I was being a hypocrite however what right does she have to criticize my dating choices? AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's look at this situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The main issue here is about the author's reasoning for marrying Sofia because she didn't sleep around, even though he had done so in his youth.\n\nFirst, the author admits he slept around in his early 20s. His friend points out this hypocrisy, which is a valid point. Hypocrisy often arises when someone applies different standards to themselves versus others. The author is being criticized for valuing Sofia's virginity while not holding himself to the same standard. \n\nCatholic teachings do emphasize chastity before marriage, so from a religious standpoint, Sofia's actions align with that. However, the author's own past behavior contradicts those values. This inconsistency might be why his friend called him an asshole. \n\nThe author argues that Sofia was his ideal choice, but his past behavior shows he didn't follow the same ideals. The friend's criticism isn't about his right to choose a spouse but about the double standard. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he's not violating any laws or clear moral rules by marrying someone he admires. But ethically, hypocrisy can be a problem. The key is whether his judgment of Sofia is unfair. If he's holding her to a standard he doesn't follow himself, that's an issue. \n\nSo, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because his actions show hypocrisy, which is a moral flaw even if not illegal. The friend's reaction is a response to that inconsistency.\n"
