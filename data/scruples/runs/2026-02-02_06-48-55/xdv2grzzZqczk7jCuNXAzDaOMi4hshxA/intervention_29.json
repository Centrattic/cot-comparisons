Now I'll just call her Sofia. My my wife Sofia is beautiful, but most of all, she has a wonderful personality. She is reserved, incredibly kind hearted and mentally strong. She had all the qualities to make a great mother. (we're planning on trying for kids soon). She's Mexican and was born/raised there, and she is quite religious Cahtolic.\n\nNow I'm also Catholic as well, I come from an Irish American Cahtolic background. However it's more of a ''religious in name only'' sort of thing, I somewhat vaguely believe in a deity of some sorts but not really a strong belief in the scripture like my parents. \n\nAnyway, when I first started dating her, the first thing my mates said was literally ''Dude this woman is wifey material''. It became a bit of a running joke, ''wifey material''. \n\nShe seemed like the PERFECT woman and I was a bit persistant when I first met her but eventually she agreed to go on a date from me, from then on it was history because we did have a lot in common. So now we married but one of the reasons I married her, aside from her personality, was that she was a virgin. She didn't sleep around whatsoever, she held out for the ''right guy'' and that guy was me. \n\nSo when I was talking to my female friend (30F) I said that one of the reasons I wanted to marry her was because of her personality AND the fact that she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. I thought this was an okay view to hold but she called me a ''Fucking asshole'' because she pointed out that I slept around in my youth. \n\nIt's true, when I was in my early 20's, I did a lot of sleeping around and hookup culture. And I could have seen myself marrying those girls if I was left with no choice, but they were never my IDEAL choices for partners, so I feel like Sofia was a god send in that regard. My friend (20F) still said I was being a hypocrite however what right does she have to criticize my dating choices? AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author married Sofia because she was a virgin, even though he had a history of sleeping around. His friend called him an asshole for pointing this out. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is a 30-year-old man who married Sofia, who he considered \"wifey material,\" partly because she was a virgin. His friend points out the hypocrisy since he had a lot of partners in his early 20s.\n\nThe main question is whether being hypocritical in this scenario makes him in the wrong. The author's justification is that he found Sofia ideal for marriage, while his past partners were not his ideal choices. But the friend argues that his double standards are hypocritical.\n\nHypocrisy here is a key issue. The author is judging Sofia's past sexual behavior (being a virgin) while being aware of his own past. This could be seen as unfair, especially if he's holding her to a standard he didn't hold himself to. Even though he claims he wouldn't have married the past partners, the fact remains that he judged them as less ideal, which might not absolve him of hypocrisy.\n\nAnother angle is societal standards and personal values. The author is Catholic, which may influence his views on virginity. However, his own religious practice is not strict, so his emphasis on Sofia's virginity might be more about personal preference than religious obligation. This could make his stance appear inconsistent, especially since he doesn't hold himself to the same standard.\n\nThe friend's criticism is valid in pointing out the hypocrisy. The author is projecting his own past onto Sofia's expectations. Whether this makes him \"in the wrong\" depends on the context. If being a virgin was a deal-breaker for him, then it's personal choice. But if he's using that as a justification while ignoring his own history, it's hypocritical.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide if that's accurate. The key is whether the author's actions are harmful or judgmental. He's not hurting Sofia directly, but he might be perpetuating double standards. The friend's criticism isn't about the marriage itself but the hypocrisy in the statement. So, even if the marriage is good, the author's hypocrisy is the issue here.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong because of the hypocrisy and double standard he's exhibiting.\n"
