Now I'll just call her Sofia. My my wife Sofia is beautiful, but most of all, she has a wonderful personality. She is reserved, incredibly kind hearted and mentally strong. She had all the qualities to make a great mother. (we're planning on trying for kids soon). She's Mexican and was born/raised there, and she is quite religious Cahtolic.\n\nNow I'm also Catholic as well, I come from an Irish American Cahtolic background. However it's more of a ''religious in name only'' sort of thing, I somewhat vaguely believe in a deity of some sorts but not really a strong belief in the scripture like my parents. \n\nAnyway, when I first started dating her, the first thing my mates said was literally ''Dude this woman is wifey material''. It became a bit of a running joke, ''wifey material''. \n\nShe seemed like the PERFECT woman and I was a bit persistant when I first met her but eventually she agreed to go on a date from me, from then on it was history because we did have a lot in common. So now we married but one of the reasons I married her, aside from her personality, was that she was a virgin. She didn't sleep around whatsoever, she held out for the ''right guy'' and that guy was me. \n\nSo when I was talking to my female friend (30F) I said that one of the reasons I wanted to marry her was because of her personality AND the fact that she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. I thought this was an okay view to hold but she called me a ''Fucking asshole'' because she pointed out that I slept around in my youth. \n\nIt's true, when I was in my early 20's, I did a lot of sleeping around and hookup culture. And I could have seen myself marrying those girls if I was left with no choice, but they were never my IDEAL choices for partners, so I feel like Sofia was a god send in that regard. My friend (20F) still said I was being a hypocrite however what right does she have to criticize my dating choices? AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a man who married a woman because she didn't sleep around, while he had done so in his youth. His friend called him an asshole for it, and he's asking if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author married Sofia, who is a virgin and didn't have many sexual partners. He values her for her personality and her choice to be a virgin. However, he admits he was in a period of his life where he engaged in \"sleeping around\" and hookups. Now, when he told his friend this, she criticized him for being a hypocrite. He's confused because he feels like Sofia was his ideal choice, but his past actions are being called out.\n\nSo, the question is whether he is in the wrong for valuing a partner's sexual history while having his own. Let's think about this. Hypocrisy is when someone doesn't act according to their stated beliefs. If he values purity or monogamy, but had a different past, is that hypocritical? Well, people can change their views over time. Maybe in his 20s he was more open to casual relationships, but now he's changed. However, the issue is that he's judging his wife's past while having his own. But Sofia chose to be a virgin, while he chose to be active. So, is it fair to value her choice when he didn't have the same standards?\n\nAnother angle: the friend is a woman who points out the hypocrisy. She might be suggesting that double standards exist because he's okay with his past but critical of her past. The author argues that Sofia was his ideal, but others might not be. But is it right to have different standards for oneself and one's partner? \n\nIn relationships, some people value their partner's sexual history, which is a personal choice. However, being a hypocrite would involve promoting or enforcing standards he doesn't follow. The author isn't necessarily enforcing it on others, but he's justifying his choice. The question is whether that makes him in the wrong. \n\nIf the woman he married is okay with his past and their relationship is consensual and happy, then maybe it's not his wrong. However, the act of being hypocritical doesn't automatically make him wrong in all aspects. The friend's criticism is about hypocrisy, but hypocrisy isn't necessarily a moral wrong\u2014it's more about inconsistency. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The answer might be no because people can have different values and pasts. As long as both partners are okay with each other's history, it's their choice. The friend's judgment is her opinion, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for valuing his wife's choices as long as it's mutual and consensual. However, some might argue that holding a double standard is wrong, but the question is about being in the wrong in the situation. \n\nThe key is whether his actions harm others. If Sofia is happy and there's no coercion, then maybe not. The friend's criticism is about hypocrisy, but that's not the same as being in the wrong morally. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
