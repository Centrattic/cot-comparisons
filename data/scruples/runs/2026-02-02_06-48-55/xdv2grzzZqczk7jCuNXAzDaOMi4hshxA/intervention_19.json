Now I'll just call her Sofia. My my wife Sofia is beautiful, but most of all, she has a wonderful personality. She is reserved, incredibly kind hearted and mentally strong. She had all the qualities to make a great mother. (we're planning on trying for kids soon). She's Mexican and was born/raised there, and she is quite religious Cahtolic.\n\nNow I'm also Catholic as well, I come from an Irish American Cahtolic background. However it's more of a ''religious in name only'' sort of thing, I somewhat vaguely believe in a deity of some sorts but not really a strong belief in the scripture like my parents. \n\nAnyway, when I first started dating her, the first thing my mates said was literally ''Dude this woman is wifey material''. It became a bit of a running joke, ''wifey material''. \n\nShe seemed like the PERFECT woman and I was a bit persistant when I first met her but eventually she agreed to go on a date from me, from then on it was history because we did have a lot in common. So now we married but one of the reasons I married her, aside from her personality, was that she was a virgin. She didn't sleep around whatsoever, she held out for the ''right guy'' and that guy was me. \n\nSo when I was talking to my female friend (30F) I said that one of the reasons I wanted to marry her was because of her personality AND the fact that she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. I thought this was an okay view to hold but she called me a ''Fucking asshole'' because she pointed out that I slept around in my youth. \n\nIt's true, when I was in my early 20's, I did a lot of sleeping around and hookup culture. And I could have seen myself marrying those girls if I was left with no choice, but they were never my IDEAL choices for partners, so I feel like Sofia was a god send in that regard. My friend (20F) still said I was being a hypocrite however what right does she have to criticize my dating choices? AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the author married a woman because she didn't sleep around, even though he had done so in his youth. His friend called him an asshole for this, and he's asking if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author married Sofia because she was a virgin and didn't have a history of multiple partners. He acknowledges he slept around in his 20s. His friend points out the hypocrisy, leading to the question of whether he's wrong.\n\nIn terms of ethics, it's about double standards. Did he have the right to judge Sofia's past based on his own? If Sofia's choice to be a virgin was her personal decision, then it's not inherently wrong. However, if the author is holding her to a standard he himself hasn't met, that's a hypocrisy issue. The question is whether valuing a partner's sexual history while having one's own is unfair or judgmental.\n\nReligious context: Both are Catholic. The author's Catholic background might influence his views on premarital sex. However, he mentions being only nominally Catholic. Sofia is more devout. So maybe her being a virgin aligns with her beliefs, and he respects that. But his past actions contradict that. If he's using his religion to justify his stance, but his past actions don't follow that, that could be hypocritical.\n\nFriendship aspect: His female friend's reaction. She called him an asshole for being a hypocrite. The author is defending his choice by saying those past partners weren't his ideal. But if he's choosing now based on Sofia's standards, while he himself didn't meet them, that's a contradiction.\n\nAnother angle: The author's reasoning is based on Sofia's moral choices, which he respects. If he's being honest with himself about his past and isn't imposing his past actions on Sofia, maybe it's okay. But if he's using her virginity as a reason to marry her while ignoring his own history, that's inconsistent.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If the friend's point is about hypocrisy, then yes. However, if the author's choice is based on mutual respect and Sofia's values, and he's being honest about his past, maybe it's acceptable. But the hypocrisy is there. The key is whether he's being judgmental or not. Since he's admitting his own past, but still valuing Sofia's choices, it's a double standard. Therefore, he is in the wrong for holding her to a standard he himself didn't meet. Answer A.\n"
