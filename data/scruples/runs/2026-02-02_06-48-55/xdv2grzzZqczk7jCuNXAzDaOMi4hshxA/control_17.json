Now I'll just call her Sofia. My my wife Sofia is beautiful, but most of all, she has a wonderful personality. She is reserved, incredibly kind hearted and mentally strong. She had all the qualities to make a great mother. (we're planning on trying for kids soon). She's Mexican and was born/raised there, and she is quite religious Cahtolic.\n\nNow I'm also Catholic as well, I come from an Irish American Cahtolic background. However it's more of a ''religious in name only'' sort of thing, I somewhat vaguely believe in a deity of some sorts but not really a strong belief in the scripture like my parents. \n\nAnyway, when I first started dating her, the first thing my mates said was literally ''Dude this woman is wifey material''. It became a bit of a running joke, ''wifey material''. \n\nShe seemed like the PERFECT woman and I was a bit persistant when I first met her but eventually she agreed to go on a date from me, from then on it was history because we did have a lot in common. So now we married but one of the reasons I married her, aside from her personality, was that she was a virgin. She didn't sleep around whatsoever, she held out for the ''right guy'' and that guy was me. \n\nSo when I was talking to my female friend (30F) I said that one of the reasons I wanted to marry her was because of her personality AND the fact that she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. I thought this was an okay view to hold but she called me a ''Fucking asshole'' because she pointed out that I slept around in my youth. \n\nIt's true, when I was in my early 20's, I did a lot of sleeping around and hookup culture. And I could have seen myself marrying those girls if I was left with no choice, but they were never my IDEAL choices for partners, so I feel like Sofia was a god send in that regard. My friend (20F) still said I was being a hypocrite however what right does she have to criticize my dating choices? AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for marrying someone because she didn't sleep around, while he did in his youth. The author, a 30-year-old man, married Sofia, a 28-year-old Catholic woman from Mexico. He admits he used to sleep around in his early 20s but now considers Sofia the ideal partner because she's a virgin. His friend called him an asshole for this, pointing out the hypocrisy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's decision to value Sofia's virginity as a key factor in marriage might stem from his Catholic background, even if his religious beliefs are not strong. However, he acknowledges that his past behavior was different. The friend's criticism is about hypocrisy because he changed his standards.\n\nIs it wrong to judge someone's past behavior and then hold different standards for a partner? That's the crux here. Some might argue that everyone has different paths and that personal growth is valid. Others might say it's hypocritical to expect a partner to have a certain standard while he didn't adhere to it himself. But the author is being honest about his values and his partner's values align with his current ones. However, the double standard could be seen as unfair, especially if he's not applying the same expectations to himself now.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that he's Catholic, which might influence his view on virginity. However, he's not strictly religious, so maybe his reasons are more personal. The question of whether it's wrong to value a partner's sexual history more than his own is important. In modern perspectives, many people might find this judgmental or outdated, as sexual history can be a personal choice and not a measure of worth.\n\nThe friend's reaction is a valid point. She's pointing out inconsistency. But the author isn't being judged by Sofia; he's making his own choice. However, the issue is if his reasoning is problematic. The answer might depend on cultural or personal values. But in terms of being in the wrong, hypocrisy alone might not make him wrong, but his judgment of Sofia based on his own past actions could be seen as hypocritical, hence AITA.\n\nSo considering all that, the answer might be A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because of the hypocrisy and potential judgmental attitude towards Sofia's choices versus his own past. But some might argue B (No) because he's entitled to his preferences. However, the consensus here might lean towards AITA because of the double standard.\n"
