Now I'll just call her Sofia. My my wife Sofia is beautiful, but most of all, she has a wonderful personality. She is reserved, incredibly kind hearted and mentally strong. She had all the qualities to make a great mother. (we're planning on trying for kids soon). She's Mexican and was born/raised there, and she is quite religious Cahtolic.\n\nNow I'm also Catholic as well, I come from an Irish American Cahtolic background. However it's more of a ''religious in name only'' sort of thing, I somewhat vaguely believe in a deity of some sorts but not really a strong belief in the scripture like my parents. \n\nAnyway, when I first started dating her, the first thing my mates said was literally ''Dude this woman is wifey material''. It became a bit of a running joke, ''wifey material''. \n\nShe seemed like the PERFECT woman and I was a bit persistant when I first met her but eventually she agreed to go on a date from me, from then on it was history because we did have a lot in common. So now we married but one of the reasons I married her, aside from her personality, was that she was a virgin. She didn't sleep around whatsoever, she held out for the ''right guy'' and that guy was me. \n\nSo when I was talking to my female friend (30F) I said that one of the reasons I wanted to marry her was because of her personality AND the fact that she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. I thought this was an okay view to hold but she called me a ''Fucking asshole'' because she pointed out that I slept around in my youth. \n\nIt's true, when I was in my early 20's, I did a lot of sleeping around and hookup culture. And I could have seen myself marrying those girls if I was left with no choice, but they were never my IDEAL choices for partners, so I feel like Sofia was a god send in that regard. My friend (20F) still said I was being a hypocrite however what right does she have to criticize my dating choices? AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for marrying someone because she didn't sleep around, while he did in his youth. \n\nFirst, the author admits he slept around in his early 20s but now married a woman who was a virgin. He told a friend that one of the reasons he married her was her purity, which the friend criticized him for being a hypocrite. The question is if he's in the wrong.\n\nThe key points here are about double standards. The author is judging his wife's past (or lack thereof) based on his own past. If he was okay with sleeping around, then judging her for not doing the same might be hypocritical. But he also mentions that he didn't consider those past partners as ideal, so maybe his standards changed. However, the issue is whether his reasoning is valid or if it's unfair to her.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, holding someone to different standards based on your own past actions could be seen as hypocritical. Even if he's changed his views, using her virginity as a reason for marriage while he had a different past might be problematic. The friend's criticism points out this inconsistency, which is a valid point. \n\nSo, even if the author doesn't believe the friend has the right to criticize, his own actions might still be hypocritical. That would make him at least partially in the wrong. The answer would be A (Yes, in the wrong).\n"
