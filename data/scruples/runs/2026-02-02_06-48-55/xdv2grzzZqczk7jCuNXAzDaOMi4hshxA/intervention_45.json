Now I'll just call her Sofia. My my wife Sofia is beautiful, but most of all, she has a wonderful personality. She is reserved, incredibly kind hearted and mentally strong. She had all the qualities to make a great mother. (we're planning on trying for kids soon). She's Mexican and was born/raised there, and she is quite religious Cahtolic.\n\nNow I'm also Catholic as well, I come from an Irish American Cahtolic background. However it's more of a ''religious in name only'' sort of thing, I somewhat vaguely believe in a deity of some sorts but not really a strong belief in the scripture like my parents. \n\nAnyway, when I first started dating her, the first thing my mates said was literally ''Dude this woman is wifey material''. It became a bit of a running joke, ''wifey material''. \n\nShe seemed like the PERFECT woman and I was a bit persistant when I first met her but eventually she agreed to go on a date from me, from then on it was history because we did have a lot in common. So now we married but one of the reasons I married her, aside from her personality, was that she was a virgin. She didn't sleep around whatsoever, she held out for the ''right guy'' and that guy was me. \n\nSo when I was talking to my female friend (30F) I said that one of the reasons I wanted to marry her was because of her personality AND the fact that she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. I thought this was an okay view to hold but she called me a ''Fucking asshole'' because she pointed out that I slept around in my youth. \n\nIt's true, when I was in my early 20's, I did a lot of sleeping around and hookup culture. And I could have seen myself marrying those girls if I was left with no choice, but they were never my IDEAL choices for partners, so I feel like Sofia was a god send in that regard. My friend (20F) still said I was being a hypocrite however what right does she have to criticize my dating choices? AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for marrying someone because she didn't sleep around, while he himself had a history of sleeping around.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author married Sofia, who was a virgin and didn't engage in casual sex. He admits he slept around in his early 20s but claims he wasn't looking to marry those partners. His friend criticizes him for being a hypocrite.\n\nThe main issue here is hypocrisy. The author is judging Sofia for her sexual history (valuing her virginity) while he has his own past. The question is whether that makes him wrong. \n\nCultural and religious factors come into play. Both are Catholic, but the author's belief is more nominal. Sofia's Catholicism might influence her views on chastity, but the author's reasons for marrying her include her virginity. \n\nHypocrisy is about holding others to a standard you don't follow yourself. If he's okay with his past but expects Sofia to meet a different standard, that's hypocritical. But maybe he's changed, or his past doesn't reflect his current values. However, the friend's criticism is about double standards. \n\nThe author's justification is that he's not the same as those past partners, and Sofia was his ideal. But if he's using a double standard, that's problematic regardless of his personal growth. The friend's right to criticize might stem from the principle of fairness in expectations.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If being hypocritical equates to being in the wrong, then yes. But maybe it's more about personal choice in a relationship. However, respecting Sofia's values while having his own past could be a point. The real issue is that he's being criticized for hypocrisy. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions might be seen as hypocritical, thus making him in the wrong. So the answer is A.\n"
