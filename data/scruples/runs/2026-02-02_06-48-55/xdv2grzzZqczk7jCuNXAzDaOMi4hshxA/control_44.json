Now I'll just call her Sofia. My my wife Sofia is beautiful, but most of all, she has a wonderful personality. She is reserved, incredibly kind hearted and mentally strong. She had all the qualities to make a great mother. (we're planning on trying for kids soon). She's Mexican and was born/raised there, and she is quite religious Cahtolic.\n\nNow I'm also Catholic as well, I come from an Irish American Cahtolic background. However it's more of a ''religious in name only'' sort of thing, I somewhat vaguely believe in a deity of some sorts but not really a strong belief in the scripture like my parents. \n\nAnyway, when I first started dating her, the first thing my mates said was literally ''Dude this woman is wifey material''. It became a bit of a running joke, ''wifey material''. \n\nShe seemed like the PERFECT woman and I was a bit persistant when I first met her but eventually she agreed to go on a date from me, from then on it was history because we did have a lot in common. So now we married but one of the reasons I married her, aside from her personality, was that she was a virgin. She didn't sleep around whatsoever, she held out for the ''right guy'' and that guy was me. \n\nSo when I was talking to my female friend (30F) I said that one of the reasons I wanted to marry her was because of her personality AND the fact that she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. I thought this was an okay view to hold but she called me a ''Fucking asshole'' because she pointed out that I slept around in my youth. \n\nIt's true, when I was in my early 20's, I did a lot of sleeping around and hookup culture. And I could have seen myself marrying those girls if I was left with no choice, but they were never my IDEAL choices for partners, so I feel like Sofia was a god send in that regard. My friend (20F) still said I was being a hypocrite however what right does she have to criticize my dating choices? AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong. The situation is that he married Sofia because she was a virgin and didn't sleep around, even though he had a history of sleeping around in his youth. His friend criticized him for being hypocritical, and he's asking if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the key points. The author's perspective is that he values a partner who is chaste and that Sofia fit that criteria. However, he had a history of being promiscuous himself. The friend points out the hypocrisy, leading the author to question if he's in the wrong.\n\nThe question is whether his actions make him the asshole. Hypocrisy is a common argument here. People often criticize others for double standards. The author is valuing virginity in a partner but doesn't hold himself to the same standard. That could be seen as inconsistent. \n\nHowever, another angle is that the author has changed his behavior over time. He was in a different place in his youth and now has different values. People do grow and change, so maybe his current standards are valid. But the issue is whether it's fair to apply different standards to himself and his partner based on past behavior.\n\nThe Catholic background might also play a role. The author isn't very religious, but Sofia is more devout. The expectation of virginity might stem from religious or personal values. However, the problem arises when his past actions contrast with his current judgment of his wife's past.\n\nThe key here is hypocrisy. If he's applying different standards to himself and his friend's potential partners, that's a problem. But if he's changed and his current values are genuine, then it's about personal choice. However, the fact that he married her specifically for her virginity while he had a promiscuous past could be seen as unfair or judgmental, especially if he expects her to adhere to standards he himself didn't follow.\n\nAnother point is the friend's right to criticize. If the friend isn't involved in their relationship, she's not the one to pass judgment. But the author's hypocrisy is the main issue. The question is whether valuing a partner's chastity while having a promiscuous past makes him wrong.\n\nIn relationships, mutual respect and shared values are important. If the author is okay with his past and his partner's current values, then it's their choice. However, the hypocrisy aspect might lead others to see him as judgmental or inconsistent, hence \"asshole\" status. \n\nBut in terms of being in the wrong, it's more about personal values than right or wrong. If the author is honest with himself and his partner, and they're both okay with the arrangement, then maybe he's not in the wrong. However, the fact that he's pointing out his partner's past while having his own might be where the issue lies. So, depending on cultural or personal standards, the answer could vary. But the main point is whether his actions are hypocritical, which they are, leading to the conclusion that he's in the wrong.\n"
