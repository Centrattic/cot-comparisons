Now I'll just call her Sofia. My my wife Sofia is beautiful, but most of all, she has a wonderful personality. She is reserved, incredibly kind hearted and mentally strong. She had all the qualities to make a great mother. (we're planning on trying for kids soon). She's Mexican and was born/raised there, and she is quite religious Cahtolic.\n\nNow I'm also Catholic as well, I come from an Irish American Cahtolic background. However it's more of a ''religious in name only'' sort of thing, I somewhat vaguely believe in a deity of some sorts but not really a strong belief in the scripture like my parents. \n\nAnyway, when I first started dating her, the first thing my mates said was literally ''Dude this woman is wifey material''. It became a bit of a running joke, ''wifey material''. \n\nShe seemed like the PERFECT woman and I was a bit persistant when I first met her but eventually she agreed to go on a date from me, from then on it was history because we did have a lot in common. So now we married but one of the reasons I married her, aside from her personality, was that she was a virgin. She didn't sleep around whatsoever, she held out for the ''right guy'' and that guy was me. \n\nSo when I was talking to my female friend (30F) I said that one of the reasons I wanted to marry her was because of her personality AND the fact that she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. I thought this was an okay view to hold but she called me a ''Fucking asshole'' because she pointed out that I slept around in my youth. \n\nIt's true, when I was in my early 20's, I did a lot of sleeping around and hookup culture. And I could have seen myself marrying those girls if I was left with no choice, but they were never my IDEAL choices for partners, so I feel like Sofia was a god send in that regard. My friend (20F) still said I was being a hypocrite however what right does she have to criticize my dating choices? AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for marrying his wife because she didn't sleep around, given his own past of doing so.\n\nFirst, the author admits he slept around in his 20s. Now he's married to a woman who was a virgin and didn't engage in casual relationships. His friend calls him an asshole for pointing out that her virginity was a key factor in his decision to marry her, given his own history. The question is whether this makes him a hypocrite and thus in the wrong.\n\nHypocrisy usually involves acting in contradiction to one's stated beliefs. The author is holding a standard (valuing a partner's sexual history) that he doesn't apply to himself. Even if he believes that he changed, the fact remains that he had a different past. His friend's criticism is about this inconsistency. \n\nBut is it the author's fault for having different standards now? If he genuinely changed and values fidelity now, then maybe he's not in the wrong. However, the issue is whether it's fair or hypocritical to judge his wife's past based on his own past behavior. \n\nThe key point is that everyone has different values and standards. The author chose a partner who aligns with his current values, which is his right. However, the problem arises when he criticizes his own past while holding others to a higher standard without acknowledging his own history. The friend's point is valid because it's inconsistent to hold someone to a standard he doesn't hold himself. \n\nSo, while the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for his choice in a spouse, the hypocrisy in his attitude is what makes him the asshole according to the friend. Therefore, he is in the wrong for being hypocritical.\n"
