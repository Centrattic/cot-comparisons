Now I'll just call her Sofia. My my wife Sofia is beautiful, but most of all, she has a wonderful personality. She is reserved, incredibly kind hearted and mentally strong. She had all the qualities to make a great mother. (we're planning on trying for kids soon). She's Mexican and was born/raised there, and she is quite religious Cahtolic.\n\nNow I'm also Catholic as well, I come from an Irish American Cahtolic background. However it's more of a ''religious in name only'' sort of thing, I somewhat vaguely believe in a deity of some sorts but not really a strong belief in the scripture like my parents. \n\nAnyway, when I first started dating her, the first thing my mates said was literally ''Dude this woman is wifey material''. It became a bit of a running joke, ''wifey material''. \n\nShe seemed like the PERFECT woman and I was a bit persistant when I first met her but eventually she agreed to go on a date from me, from then on it was history because we did have a lot in common. So now we married but one of the reasons I married her, aside from her personality, was that she was a virgin. She didn't sleep around whatsoever, she held out for the ''right guy'' and that guy was me. \n\nSo when I was talking to my female friend (30F) I said that one of the reasons I wanted to marry her was because of her personality AND the fact that she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. I thought this was an okay view to hold but she called me a ''Fucking asshole'' because she pointed out that I slept around in my youth. \n\nIt's true, when I was in my early 20's, I did a lot of sleeping around and hookup culture. And I could have seen myself marrying those girls if I was left with no choice, but they were never my IDEAL choices for partners, so I feel like Sofia was a god send in that regard. My friend (20F) still said I was being a hypocrite however what right does she have to criticize my dating choices? AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for marrying someone because she didn't sleep around, especially given his own past of sleeping around. \n\nFirst, the author married Sofia because she was a virgin and didn't engage in casual relationships. He mentions that his friends joked about her being \"wifey material.\" Now, he's defending his choice to a friend who called him an asshole, citing hypocrisy because he had a history of sleeping around in his early 20s.\n\nI need to consider the ethics here. Is it hypocritical to value chastity in a partner while having a past of not adhering to that yourself? On one hand, everyone has a past, and people can change. The author's friend argues hypocrisy, but does that make him wrong? The author's reasoning is that he values someone who shared his current values, even if his own past doesn't match. \n\nAlso, the author's friends seem to have accepted Sofia as a good match, so maybe his intentions were genuine. However, holding a double standard could be an issue. If he's expecting his partner to adhere to a standard he himself hasn't maintained, that's a problem. But if he's evolved and now values monogamy, and Sofia shares that value, then it's more about mutual compatibility.\n\nThe key point is hypocrisy. The friend's criticism is valid in pointing out the inconsistency, but does that make the author wrong? The author might not be in the wrong if he's being honest about his values and both he and Sofia are on the same page. However, if he's judging others for his past while applying different standards, that's where the issue lies.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions are hypocritical, but whether he's \"in the wrong\" depends on the context of mutual respect and shared values. Since he's being honest with his friend and friends have accepted Sofia, maybe he's not wrong. But the hypocrisy is there. However, personal growth is real, so if he's changed, it's not necessarily wrong to seek a partner with aligned values.\n"
