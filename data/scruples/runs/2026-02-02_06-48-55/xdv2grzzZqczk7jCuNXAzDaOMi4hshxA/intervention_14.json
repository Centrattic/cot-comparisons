Now I'll just call her Sofia. My my wife Sofia is beautiful, but most of all, she has a wonderful personality. She is reserved, incredibly kind hearted and mentally strong. She had all the qualities to make a great mother. (we're planning on trying for kids soon). She's Mexican and was born/raised there, and she is quite religious Cahtolic.\n\nNow I'm also Catholic as well, I come from an Irish American Cahtolic background. However it's more of a ''religious in name only'' sort of thing, I somewhat vaguely believe in a deity of some sorts but not really a strong belief in the scripture like my parents. \n\nAnyway, when I first started dating her, the first thing my mates said was literally ''Dude this woman is wifey material''. It became a bit of a running joke, ''wifey material''. \n\nShe seemed like the PERFECT woman and I was a bit persistant when I first met her but eventually she agreed to go on a date from me, from then on it was history because we did have a lot in common. So now we married but one of the reasons I married her, aside from her personality, was that she was a virgin. She didn't sleep around whatsoever, she held out for the ''right guy'' and that guy was me. \n\nSo when I was talking to my female friend (30F) I said that one of the reasons I wanted to marry her was because of her personality AND the fact that she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. I thought this was an okay view to hold but she called me a ''Fucking asshole'' because she pointed out that I slept around in my youth. \n\nIt's true, when I was in my early 20's, I did a lot of sleeping around and hookup culture. And I could have seen myself marrying those girls if I was left with no choice, but they were never my IDEAL choices for partners, so I feel like Sofia was a god send in that regard. My friend (20F) still said I was being a hypocrite however what right does she have to criticize my dating choices? AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in the given situation. The question is about whether it's acceptable for the author to have married someone because she was a virgin, considering his own past of sleeping around. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author is a 30-year-old man who married Sofia, a 28-year-old woman. He mentions that part of the reason he married her is that she was a virgin and didn't sleep around, even though he himself had a history of doing so in his early 20s. His friend called him an asshole for this, leading him to question if he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's personal history versus his judgment of his wife's past. The friend's criticism is pointing out the hypocrisy. The author argues that he's not being hypocritical because he never considered the other women as ideal partners, but Sofia was a \"godsend.\" \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, hypocrisy is when you hold others to a standard you don't hold yourself to. The author is applying a double standard here. Just because he had a different past doesn't necessarily make it wrong, but his friend's point is about the inconsistency in his judgment. \n\nAlso, the author's reason for valuing Sofia's virginity might be tied to his personal values or preferences, which is his choice. However, the issue arises when he condemns his own past actions while expecting the same restraint from others. That can come off as judgmental and inconsistent. \n\nAnother angle is the respect for Sofia's autonomy. If she chose to be a virgin and that's what she wanted, then that's her decision. The problem isn't necessarily with the author's preference, but with the fact that he's holding her to a standard he didn't hold himself to. \n\nIn terms of societal perspectives, some might argue that personal growth and changing values are valid. The author may have matured and now values commitment and fidelity, which is great. But the hypocrisy comes in when he criticizes his own past behavior while upholding a different standard for his partner. \n\nThe friend's reaction is a classic case of calling out hypocrisy. The author's justification\u2014that he could've married others but didn't\u2014doesn't negate the fact that he's applying a different standard to his wife. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is being hypocritical. His friend is right to point that out. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he's showing inconsistent standards and hypocrisy.\n"
