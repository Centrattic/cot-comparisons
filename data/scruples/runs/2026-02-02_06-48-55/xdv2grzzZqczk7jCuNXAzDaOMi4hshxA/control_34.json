Now I'll just call her Sofia. My my wife Sofia is beautiful, but most of all, she has a wonderful personality. She is reserved, incredibly kind hearted and mentally strong. She had all the qualities to make a great mother. (we're planning on trying for kids soon). She's Mexican and was born/raised there, and she is quite religious Cahtolic.\n\nNow I'm also Catholic as well, I come from an Irish American Cahtolic background. However it's more of a ''religious in name only'' sort of thing, I somewhat vaguely believe in a deity of some sorts but not really a strong belief in the scripture like my parents. \n\nAnyway, when I first started dating her, the first thing my mates said was literally ''Dude this woman is wifey material''. It became a bit of a running joke, ''wifey material''. \n\nShe seemed like the PERFECT woman and I was a bit persistant when I first met her but eventually she agreed to go on a date from me, from then on it was history because we did have a lot in common. So now we married but one of the reasons I married her, aside from her personality, was that she was a virgin. She didn't sleep around whatsoever, she held out for the ''right guy'' and that guy was me. \n\nSo when I was talking to my female friend (30F) I said that one of the reasons I wanted to marry her was because of her personality AND the fact that she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. I thought this was an okay view to hold but she called me a ''Fucking asshole'' because she pointed out that I slept around in my youth. \n\nIt's true, when I was in my early 20's, I did a lot of sleeping around and hookup culture. And I could have seen myself marrying those girls if I was left with no choice, but they were never my IDEAL choices for partners, so I feel like Sofia was a god send in that regard. My friend (20F) still said I was being a hypocrite however what right does she have to criticize my dating choices? AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for marrying someone because she didn't sleep around, even though he did. So first, I need to break down the situation.\n\nThe author is a 30-year-old man married to Sofia, a 28-year-old Mexican Catholic woman. He mentions that he married her partly because she was a virgin and didn't sleep around, which he considered important. However, he admits that he had a history of sleeping around in his early 20s. His friend criticized him for this, calling him a hypocrite and an asshole.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's consider different angles. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, some might argue that holding double standards is unfair. If he engaged in promiscuous behavior in the past, then valuing a partner's virginity seems contradictory. Hypocrisy here could be a point against him. But others might say that people can change and that his current values are valid, especially if they're both practicing Catholicism, which often emphasizes chastity before marriage. \n\nReligious context is important here. Since both are Catholic, Sofia's choice to be a virgin might align with their shared beliefs. The author might see it as respecting her values rather than imposing his own. However, the issue is whether his personal hypocrisy invalidates his reasons. \n\nAlso, the friend's criticism is about double standards. If the author was okay with his own past but expects the same from his wife, that's a double standard. But if he's changed and now values monogamy, that's different. The key is intent and respect. Did he respect her choices, or is he using her chastity as a virtue while ignoring his own past?\n\nAnother angle: the question of consent and mutual respect. If both parties entered the marriage with mutual understanding and agreement on values, then maybe it's not the author's fault. However, if he judged her based on his own past, that could be problematic. \n\nBut the main issue is the hypocrisy. The friend's criticism is about holding others to a standard he doesn't meet. Even if his reasons are genuine, the double standard could make him \"in the wrong\" in terms of fairness. \n\nOn the other hand, people do have different life experiences and can choose to change their behavior. If the author has matured and now values a committed relationship, that's valid. The problem is the comparison between his past and his wife's present. \n\nI think the crux is whether the author's reasons for marrying Sofia are respectfully based on mutual values or if he's being judgmental. Since the author acknowledges his own past but sees Sofia as a \"godsend,\" it might be more about his current values aligning with hers, which isn't inherently wrong. However, the hypocrisy in his actions versus expectations could still be seen as a flaw. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intentions might be good, the inconsistency in his past behavior versus his current expectations could place him in the wrong. So the answer might be A, but there's nuance. However, given the friend's criticism is about double standards, the answer could be A. But others might defend his choice as respecting shared values. It's a bit tricky. Maybe the answer is A because the hypocrisy is the main issue here.\n"
