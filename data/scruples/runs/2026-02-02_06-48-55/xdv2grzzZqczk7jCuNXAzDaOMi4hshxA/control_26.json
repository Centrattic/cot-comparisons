Now I'll just call her Sofia. My my wife Sofia is beautiful, but most of all, she has a wonderful personality. She is reserved, incredibly kind hearted and mentally strong. She had all the qualities to make a great mother. (we're planning on trying for kids soon). She's Mexican and was born/raised there, and she is quite religious Cahtolic.\n\nNow I'm also Catholic as well, I come from an Irish American Cahtolic background. However it's more of a ''religious in name only'' sort of thing, I somewhat vaguely believe in a deity of some sorts but not really a strong belief in the scripture like my parents. \n\nAnyway, when I first started dating her, the first thing my mates said was literally ''Dude this woman is wifey material''. It became a bit of a running joke, ''wifey material''. \n\nShe seemed like the PERFECT woman and I was a bit persistant when I first met her but eventually she agreed to go on a date from me, from then on it was history because we did have a lot in common. So now we married but one of the reasons I married her, aside from her personality, was that she was a virgin. She didn't sleep around whatsoever, she held out for the ''right guy'' and that guy was me. \n\nSo when I was talking to my female friend (30F) I said that one of the reasons I wanted to marry her was because of her personality AND the fact that she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. I thought this was an okay view to hold but she called me a ''Fucking asshole'' because she pointed out that I slept around in my youth. \n\nIt's true, when I was in my early 20's, I did a lot of sleeping around and hookup culture. And I could have seen myself marrying those girls if I was left with no choice, but they were never my IDEAL choices for partners, so I feel like Sofia was a god send in that regard. My friend (20F) still said I was being a hypocrite however what right does she have to criticize my dating choices? AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the given scenario. The author married a woman because she was a virgin and didn't sleep around, but he has a history of sleeping around himself. His friend called him an asshole for that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author is Catholic, but not very religious. The woman he married is also Catholic and a virgin. He married her partly because of her purity, even though he had a history of multiple partners. His friend points out the hypocrisy. \n\nIs it wrong to value a partner's virginity? That's subjective. Some people have moral or religious reasons for preferring a virgin spouse. The author mentions his Catholic background, which traditionally values purity before marriage. However, he's not a practicing Catholic. So, his reasons might be more about personal preference than religious obligation.\n\nNow, the hypocrisy comes into play. The author had a history of sleeping around but now values a partner who is a virgin. His friend is pointing out that he's being inconsistent. But the author argues that those past partners weren't his ideal choices, and Sofia was a better fit. \n\nWhether he's in the wrong depends on whose perspective you take. If the author is honest about his values and both he and his wife are okay with it, then it's their choice. However, if he's being hypocritical and using double standards without acknowledging it, that could be problematic. \n\nThe friend's criticism is valid in pointing out the inconsistency. But the author isn't forcing anyone; he made a choice based on his own values. The question is whether that makes him in the wrong. If the author isn't harming anyone and both he and his wife are happy, then maybe not. But the double standard could be seen as judgmental or hypocritical.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions aren't necessarily wrong, but the hypocrisy is there. However, since he's not causing harm and it's a personal choice, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But if the hypocrisy is considered a fault, then A. Need to determine the standard here. The AITA (Am I the Asshole) context often looks for the person's actions being objectively wrong. Since he's being hypocritical but not hurting anyone, maybe B is the answer.\n"
