Now I'll just call her Sofia. My my wife Sofia is beautiful, but most of all, she has a wonderful personality. She is reserved, incredibly kind hearted and mentally strong. She had all the qualities to make a great mother. (we're planning on trying for kids soon). She's Mexican and was born/raised there, and she is quite religious Cahtolic.\n\nNow I'm also Catholic as well, I come from an Irish American Cahtolic background. However it's more of a ''religious in name only'' sort of thing, I somewhat vaguely believe in a deity of some sorts but not really a strong belief in the scripture like my parents. \n\nAnyway, when I first started dating her, the first thing my mates said was literally ''Dude this woman is wifey material''. It became a bit of a running joke, ''wifey material''. \n\nShe seemed like the PERFECT woman and I was a bit persistant when I first met her but eventually she agreed to go on a date from me, from then on it was history because we did have a lot in common. So now we married but one of the reasons I married her, aside from her personality, was that she was a virgin. She didn't sleep around whatsoever, she held out for the ''right guy'' and that guy was me. \n\nSo when I was talking to my female friend (30F) I said that one of the reasons I wanted to marry her was because of her personality AND the fact that she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. I thought this was an okay view to hold but she called me a ''Fucking asshole'' because she pointed out that I slept around in my youth. \n\nIt's true, when I was in my early 20's, I did a lot of sleeping around and hookup culture. And I could have seen myself marrying those girls if I was left with no choice, but they were never my IDEAL choices for partners, so I feel like Sofia was a god send in that regard. My friend (20F) still said I was being a hypocrite however what right does she have to criticize my dating choices? AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for marrying someone because she didn't sleep around, while he had a history of doing so.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author (30M) married Sofia (28F), who is a virgin. He values her for her personality and her chastity. However, he had a past of sleeping around in his 20s. His friend called him an asshole for being a hypocrite. The author is seeking validation or if he's in the wrong.\n\nThe main issue here is hypocrisy. He's marrying someone based on her chastity but has a history of not being monogamous before. So, is that hypocritical? Well, hypocrisy is when you hold others to a standard you don't meet yourself. He's not saying it's wrong to have premarital sex in general, but he values Sofia's choice. However, his own past actions differ. But he's not forcing others to follow his standards, just choosing his own partner based on his values. \n\nAnother angle: The friend's criticism might be about double standards. But the author's choice is based on his personal preferences. If he's honest with himself about his values and isn't judging others for their past, maybe it's not the wrong. However, if he's being judgmental or expecting others to conform to his standards without self-awareness, that's where the problem could be. \n\nAlso, the friend's reaction is harsh (\"fucking asshole\") just because of his past. People can have different values. The author isn't hurting others, just making a personal choice. So, while his friend sees hypocrisy, others might see personal choice. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for having personal preferences. However, if he's being hypocritical by not acknowledging his own past or if he's being judgmental towards others, that's where the issue could lie. The author's friend points out hypocrisy, but the author might counter that he's grown and changed, valuing different qualities now. \n\nSo, the answer could hinge on whether hypocrisy is the issue. If the author is self-aware and isn't imposing his standards on others, then he's not in the wrong. But if he's being hypocritical and not owning up to his past actions while expecting others to meet his standards, then he might be. The key is the author's intent and whether he's being judgmental. The friend's criticism is about the double standard, but ultimately, the author's choice is his own. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
