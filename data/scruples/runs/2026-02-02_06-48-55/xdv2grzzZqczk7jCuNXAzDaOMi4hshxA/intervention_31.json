Now I'll just call her Sofia. My my wife Sofia is beautiful, but most of all, she has a wonderful personality. She is reserved, incredibly kind hearted and mentally strong. She had all the qualities to make a great mother. (we're planning on trying for kids soon). She's Mexican and was born/raised there, and she is quite religious Cahtolic.\n\nNow I'm also Catholic as well, I come from an Irish American Cahtolic background. However it's more of a ''religious in name only'' sort of thing, I somewhat vaguely believe in a deity of some sorts but not really a strong belief in the scripture like my parents. \n\nAnyway, when I first started dating her, the first thing my mates said was literally ''Dude this woman is wifey material''. It became a bit of a running joke, ''wifey material''. \n\nShe seemed like the PERFECT woman and I was a bit persistant when I first met her but eventually she agreed to go on a date from me, from then on it was history because we did have a lot in common. So now we married but one of the reasons I married her, aside from her personality, was that she was a virgin. She didn't sleep around whatsoever, she held out for the ''right guy'' and that guy was me. \n\nSo when I was talking to my female friend (30F) I said that one of the reasons I wanted to marry her was because of her personality AND the fact that she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. I thought this was an okay view to hold but she called me a ''Fucking asshole'' because she pointed out that I slept around in my youth. \n\nIt's true, when I was in my early 20's, I did a lot of sleeping around and hookup culture. And I could have seen myself marrying those girls if I was left with no choice, but they were never my IDEAL choices for partners, so I feel like Sofia was a god send in that regard. My friend (20F) still said I was being a hypocrite however what right does she have to criticize my dating choices? AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for marrying someone because she didn't sleep around, while he had a history of doing so. \n\nFirst, the author is 30M married to a 28F woman who is a virgin. He mentions that one of the reasons he married her was her virginity, even though he had slept around in his youth. His friend called him an asshole for being hypocritical.\n\nI need to figure out if the author is in the wrong. The question is about whether holding a double standard is unethical. On one hand, the author is being honest about his reasons for marrying her. On the other hand, he's applying a standard he doesn't follow himself. That could be seen as hypocritical. \n\nBut maybe there's context. He's Catholic but not very religious, so maybe his views on virginity are influenced by that. He also says he married her for her personality, which is positive. However, valuing someone's sexual history while having a different past could be problematic. It might indicate double standards or judgmental attitudes. \n\nThe friend's criticism is about hypocrisy. The author is being called out for not holding himself to the same standard he expects from his partner. Even if he's honest about it, it's still a double standard. The key issue is whether it's wrong to judge someone else's past while not adhering to the same standard oneself. \n\nIn terms of ethics, hypocrisy can be a valid criticism. If the author is willing to judge others based on their sexual history but isn't applying the same judgment to himself, that's inconsistent. The question is whether that inconsistency makes him in the wrong. \n\nSome might argue that people can have different values, and as long as it's consensual and mutual, it's their choice. Others might say that holding a double standard is inherently unfair. The author isn't hurting anyone directly, but his reasoning might be seen as judgmental or hypocritical. \n\nThe author's friend is pointing out the hypocrisy, which is a valid point. So, the author's actions are not illegal or harmful, but the ethical issue is about double standards. Whether that's being in the wrong depends on cultural context and personal values. \n\nIn many modern perspectives, judging someone's past sexual behavior is considered outdated. So, if the author is doing that, especially with a double standard, it's seen as wrong. Therefore, the answer would be A, yes, he's in the wrong because of hypocrisy and double standards.\n"
