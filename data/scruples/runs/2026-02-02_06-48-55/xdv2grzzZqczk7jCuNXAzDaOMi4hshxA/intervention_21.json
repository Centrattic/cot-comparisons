Now I'll just call her Sofia. My my wife Sofia is beautiful, but most of all, she has a wonderful personality. She is reserved, incredibly kind hearted and mentally strong. She had all the qualities to make a great mother. (we're planning on trying for kids soon). She's Mexican and was born/raised there, and she is quite religious Cahtolic.\n\nNow I'm also Catholic as well, I come from an Irish American Cahtolic background. However it's more of a ''religious in name only'' sort of thing, I somewhat vaguely believe in a deity of some sorts but not really a strong belief in the scripture like my parents. \n\nAnyway, when I first started dating her, the first thing my mates said was literally ''Dude this woman is wifey material''. It became a bit of a running joke, ''wifey material''. \n\nShe seemed like the PERFECT woman and I was a bit persistant when I first met her but eventually she agreed to go on a date from me, from then on it was history because we did have a lot in common. So now we married but one of the reasons I married her, aside from her personality, was that she was a virgin. She didn't sleep around whatsoever, she held out for the ''right guy'' and that guy was me. \n\nSo when I was talking to my female friend (30F) I said that one of the reasons I wanted to marry her was because of her personality AND the fact that she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. I thought this was an okay view to hold but she called me a ''Fucking asshole'' because she pointed out that I slept around in my youth. \n\nIt's true, when I was in my early 20's, I did a lot of sleeping around and hookup culture. And I could have seen myself marrying those girls if I was left with no choice, but they were never my IDEAL choices for partners, so I feel like Sofia was a god send in that regard. My friend (20F) still said I was being a hypocrite however what right does she have to criticize my dating choices? AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about someone marrying a woman because she didn't sleep around, even though the author himself had a history of sleeping around in his youth. His friend called him an asshole for being hypocritical.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author married Sofia because she was a virgin and didn't engage in casual relationships. But he had a past where he was involved in hookups. His friend points out this hypocrisy. The question is whether that makes him wrong.\n\nSo, the main issue here seems to be hypocrisy. The author is making a judgment about Sofia's past based on his own religious or personal standards. But he's not applying the same standard to himself. That could be seen as double standards. In many ethical frameworks, judging others while ignoring one's own flaws is considered hypocritical and thus morally wrong.\n\nHowever, the author might argue that he had already changed his behavior and values. He's now looking for someone who aligns with his current standards, which is Sofia. But does that justify his previous behavior? The problem is that by holding Sofia to a higher standard that he himself didn't meet in the past, he's being inconsistent.\n\nAnother angle is consent and personal choice. Sofia chose to be with him because he was the \"right guy,\" and he chose her because she met his current standards. If both are happy and there's no coercion, maybe the relationship is valid. But the issue arises when he publicly criticizes Sofia's past while ignoring his own, which can be hurtful and disrespectful.\n\nAlso, the friend's criticism is about hypocrisy. If the author expects others not to judge him for his past, he shouldn't judge her. The concept of \"do not judge\" from various religions and philosophies plays into this. His Catholic background might emphasize forgiveness and not judging others, which he's violating here.\n\nBut then, the author might say that he has the right to choose his spouse based on his personal values. However, those values shouldn't be based on hypocrisy. If he's okay with his past and has grown, it's his choice, but holding others to a standard he didn't meet is problematic.\n\nIn conclusion, while the relationship itself may be valid, the author's judgment of Sofia based on his own past actions makes him hypocritical. Hypocrisy is often considered morally wrong, so the answer would be A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
