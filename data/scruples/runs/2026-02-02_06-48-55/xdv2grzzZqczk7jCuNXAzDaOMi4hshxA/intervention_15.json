Now I'll just call her Sofia. My my wife Sofia is beautiful, but most of all, she has a wonderful personality. She is reserved, incredibly kind hearted and mentally strong. She had all the qualities to make a great mother. (we're planning on trying for kids soon). She's Mexican and was born/raised there, and she is quite religious Cahtolic.\n\nNow I'm also Catholic as well, I come from an Irish American Cahtolic background. However it's more of a ''religious in name only'' sort of thing, I somewhat vaguely believe in a deity of some sorts but not really a strong belief in the scripture like my parents. \n\nAnyway, when I first started dating her, the first thing my mates said was literally ''Dude this woman is wifey material''. It became a bit of a running joke, ''wifey material''. \n\nShe seemed like the PERFECT woman and I was a bit persistant when I first met her but eventually she agreed to go on a date from me, from then on it was history because we did have a lot in common. So now we married but one of the reasons I married her, aside from her personality, was that she was a virgin. She didn't sleep around whatsoever, she held out for the ''right guy'' and that guy was me. \n\nSo when I was talking to my female friend (30F) I said that one of the reasons I wanted to marry her was because of her personality AND the fact that she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. I thought this was an okay view to hold but she called me a ''Fucking asshole'' because she pointed out that I slept around in my youth. \n\nIt's true, when I was in my early 20's, I did a lot of sleeping around and hookup culture. And I could have seen myself marrying those girls if I was left with no choice, but they were never my IDEAL choices for partners, so I feel like Sofia was a god send in that regard. My friend (20F) still said I was being a hypocrite however what right does she have to criticize my dating choices? AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for marrying someone because she didn't sleep around, despite his own past of doing so.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author married Sofia, who is a virgin and didn't engage in premarital sex. He admits to sleeping around in his early 20s. His friend called him an asshole for double standards. The core issue is whether it's hypocritical or wrong to value a partner's virginity while having a history of not adhering to that standard himself.\n\nReligious context is there since both are Catholic. The author's friend argues hypocrisy, but the author believes Sofia was his ideal partner. The question is about right and wrong, not just opinion.\n\nHypocrisy usually involves a contradiction between one's beliefs and actions. The author's actions in the past (sleeping around) contrast with his current standards (wanting a partner who is a virgin). However, people can change over time. The author might have different priorities now. But the key is whether it's wrong to judge someone else's choices based on a standard he didn't follow himself.\n\nThe friend's criticism is about the inconsistency. While the author has the right to choose his partner based on his values, the issue arises when he judges others for not meeting that standard. The author isn't necessarily wrong for choosing a partner with certain qualities, but the hypocrisy comes into play when he criticizes others for not matching his current standards, especially after his own past. \n\nHowever, the author is being honest about his preferences. The problem might be more about the friend's right to criticize, but the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. If the author is being hypocritical in his judgment, then he might be in the wrong. But if he's simply choosing a partner based on his own evolving values without judging others, then maybe not. However, the friend's point is valid that his past actions contradict his current standards, which can be hypocritical. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might be in the wrong for holding a double standard, making him hypocritical. So the answer would be A.\n"
