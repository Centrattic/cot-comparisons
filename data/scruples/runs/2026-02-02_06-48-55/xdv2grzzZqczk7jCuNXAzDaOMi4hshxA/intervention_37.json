Now I'll just call her Sofia. My my wife Sofia is beautiful, but most of all, she has a wonderful personality. She is reserved, incredibly kind hearted and mentally strong. She had all the qualities to make a great mother. (we're planning on trying for kids soon). She's Mexican and was born/raised there, and she is quite religious Cahtolic.\n\nNow I'm also Catholic as well, I come from an Irish American Cahtolic background. However it's more of a ''religious in name only'' sort of thing, I somewhat vaguely believe in a deity of some sorts but not really a strong belief in the scripture like my parents. \n\nAnyway, when I first started dating her, the first thing my mates said was literally ''Dude this woman is wifey material''. It became a bit of a running joke, ''wifey material''. \n\nShe seemed like the PERFECT woman and I was a bit persistant when I first met her but eventually she agreed to go on a date from me, from then on it was history because we did have a lot in common. So now we married but one of the reasons I married her, aside from her personality, was that she was a virgin. She didn't sleep around whatsoever, she held out for the ''right guy'' and that guy was me. \n\nSo when I was talking to my female friend (30F) I said that one of the reasons I wanted to marry her was because of her personality AND the fact that she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. I thought this was an okay view to hold but she called me a ''Fucking asshole'' because she pointed out that I slept around in my youth. \n\nIt's true, when I was in my early 20's, I did a lot of sleeping around and hookup culture. And I could have seen myself marrying those girls if I was left with no choice, but they were never my IDEAL choices for partners, so I feel like Sofia was a god send in that regard. My friend (20F) still said I was being a hypocrite however what right does she have to criticize my dating choices? AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for marrying someone because she didn't sleep around, given that he had a history of doing so. \n\nFirst, the author is a 30-year-old man who married a 28-year-old woman, Sofia, who is a virgin and values her Catholic faith. He acknowledges that she's the perfect partner for him, but he's being criticized by a friend for hypocrisy because he had a lot of sexual partners in his early 20s.\n\nThe key issue here is whether it's wrong to value a partner's virginity or chastity when the person themselves has a history of not being chaste. The author's friend argues that he's being hypocritical. \n\nNow, I need to consider cultural and personal contexts. The author is Catholic but not particularly devout, while Sofia is more religious. In some religious contexts, virginity is valued, so his preference might align with her values. However, the question is whether his judgment of her past (or lack thereof) is unfair given his own past.\n\nHypocrisy is a common criticism when someone holds others to a standard they don't meet themselves. The author is choosing a partner based on her sexual history, which he himself doesn't have. That could be seen as double standards. However, people often have different standards for themselves and their partners, which isn't necessarily wrong unless it's discriminatory or harmful.\n\nThe author isn't judging Sofia for her past; he's choosing her because of her values. But by pointing out his own past, the friend is highlighting the inconsistency. The author might not be in the wrong if his choice is based on mutual values and respect. However, if he's applying a double standard without acknowledging it, that's where the issue lies.\n\nIn terms of morality, whether someone is in the wrong depends on intent and impact. If Sofia is comfortable with his reasons and they both respect each other, maybe it's not wrong. But if he's being judgmental or disrespectful towards her for her choices while excusing his own past, then it could be problematic.\n\nThe friend's criticism is about hypocrisy, which is a valid point. The author might not be in the wrong from his own perspective, but others might see it as a double standard. The answer hinges on whether hypocrisy itself is considered wrong in this context. Since the question is about if he's the asshole (AITA), and the friend called him an asshole for hypocrisy, there's a social judgment here.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is in the wrong (A) because he's being hypocritical by holding his partner to a standard he himself didn't meet, which can be seen as judgmental and unfair. However, if the relationship is consensual and respectful, some might say he's not in the wrong (B). Considering the friend's strong reaction and the concept of hypocrisy, I lean towards A.\n"
