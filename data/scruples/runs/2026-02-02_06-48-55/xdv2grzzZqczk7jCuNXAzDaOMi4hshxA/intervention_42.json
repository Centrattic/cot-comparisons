Now I'll just call her Sofia. My my wife Sofia is beautiful, but most of all, she has a wonderful personality. She is reserved, incredibly kind hearted and mentally strong. She had all the qualities to make a great mother. (we're planning on trying for kids soon). She's Mexican and was born/raised there, and she is quite religious Cahtolic.\n\nNow I'm also Catholic as well, I come from an Irish American Cahtolic background. However it's more of a ''religious in name only'' sort of thing, I somewhat vaguely believe in a deity of some sorts but not really a strong belief in the scripture like my parents. \n\nAnyway, when I first started dating her, the first thing my mates said was literally ''Dude this woman is wifey material''. It became a bit of a running joke, ''wifey material''. \n\nShe seemed like the PERFECT woman and I was a bit persistant when I first met her but eventually she agreed to go on a date from me, from then on it was history because we did have a lot in common. So now we married but one of the reasons I married her, aside from her personality, was that she was a virgin. She didn't sleep around whatsoever, she held out for the ''right guy'' and that guy was me. \n\nSo when I was talking to my female friend (30F) I said that one of the reasons I wanted to marry her was because of her personality AND the fact that she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. I thought this was an okay view to hold but she called me a ''Fucking asshole'' because she pointed out that I slept around in my youth. \n\nIt's true, when I was in my early 20's, I did a lot of sleeping around and hookup culture. And I could have seen myself marrying those girls if I was left with no choice, but they were never my IDEAL choices for partners, so I feel like Sofia was a god send in that regard. My friend (20F) still said I was being a hypocrite however what right does she have to criticize my dating choices? AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation they described. Let's break it down.\n\nThe author is a 30-year-old man who married Sofia, a 28-year-old Mexican Catholic woman. He mentions that one of the reasons he married her was because she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. However, he admits he had a history of sleeping around in his early 20s. His friend called him an asshole for this, pointing out his hypocrisy. The question is whether he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of his reasoning. He married someone based on her virginity, which is a personal choice, but he's being criticized for hypocrisy because of his past behaviors. Is it wrong to value a partner's sexual history while having your own? That's a common debate. Some might say it's okay if both parties are okay with it, but others might see it as double standards. \n\nThe author's friend argues that he's a hypocrite. Hypocrisy is when someone holds others to a standard they don't hold themselves to. In this case, he's judging Sofia for her past (by valuing her virginity) while having his own past of casual relationships. That does seem like hypocrisy. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that he's Catholic, but not strictly so. The idea of holding someone to a purity standard while not adhering to it himself could be seen as inconsistent, especially in a religious context. \n\nHowever, there's the aspect of personal choice. People have different values. If the author and Sofia both agree that her virginity was important to him and she was comfortable with that, then their relationship is their own. The issue arises when he criticizes his friend for his past, which brings in the hypocrisy. \n\nThe friend's criticism isn't about his actions towards Sofia directly but about his judgment of others. The author's actions in his marriage might be his and his partner's business, but when he shares his reasons with others and judges his past self, that's where the hypocrisy comes in. \n\nSo, the core of the issue is hypocrisy. Whether that makes him \"in the wrong\" depends on cultural or moral standards. In many perspectives, hypocrisy is considered a flaw because it involves insincerity. However, if the author isn't hurting Sofia and they both agree on the values, some might say it's not his fault. \n\nBut the friend's point is valid: he's being judgmental towards someone else's sexual history while having his own. That's the hypocrisy. So, even if his marriage is okay, the way he's criticizing others is problematic. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for being hypocritical, even if his own relationship isn't the issue. \n\nI think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because of the hypocrisy in his judgment towards others based on his own past.\n"
