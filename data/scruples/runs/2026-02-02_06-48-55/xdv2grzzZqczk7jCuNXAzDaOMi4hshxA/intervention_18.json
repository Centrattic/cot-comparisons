Now I'll just call her Sofia. My my wife Sofia is beautiful, but most of all, she has a wonderful personality. She is reserved, incredibly kind hearted and mentally strong. She had all the qualities to make a great mother. (we're planning on trying for kids soon). She's Mexican and was born/raised there, and she is quite religious Cahtolic.\n\nNow I'm also Catholic as well, I come from an Irish American Cahtolic background. However it's more of a ''religious in name only'' sort of thing, I somewhat vaguely believe in a deity of some sorts but not really a strong belief in the scripture like my parents. \n\nAnyway, when I first started dating her, the first thing my mates said was literally ''Dude this woman is wifey material''. It became a bit of a running joke, ''wifey material''. \n\nShe seemed like the PERFECT woman and I was a bit persistant when I first met her but eventually she agreed to go on a date from me, from then on it was history because we did have a lot in common. So now we married but one of the reasons I married her, aside from her personality, was that she was a virgin. She didn't sleep around whatsoever, she held out for the ''right guy'' and that guy was me. \n\nSo when I was talking to my female friend (30F) I said that one of the reasons I wanted to marry her was because of her personality AND the fact that she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. I thought this was an okay view to hold but she called me a ''Fucking asshole'' because she pointed out that I slept around in my youth. \n\nIt's true, when I was in my early 20's, I did a lot of sleeping around and hookup culture. And I could have seen myself marrying those girls if I was left with no choice, but they were never my IDEAL choices for partners, so I feel like Sofia was a god send in that regard. My friend (20F) still said I was being a hypocrite however what right does she have to criticize my dating choices? AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for marrying someone because she didn't sleep around, while he had a history of doing so. \n\nFirst, the author is a 30-year-old man who married Sofia, a 28-year-old Mexican Catholic woman. He mentions that part of the reason he married her was because she was a virgin and didn't engage in casual relationships. However, he also admits to sleeping around in his early 20s. His friend called him an asshole for this, leading to the question.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, the key points here are hypocrisy and double standards. The author is holding Sofia to a standard he himself didn't meet. If he was okay with his past behavior, why is he applying a different standard to her? That seems hypocritical. Sofia chose to hold out for marriage, which is her choice, but the author using her virginity as a reason to marry her while he had a different past could be seen as unfair. It might also imply that he values her purity over her other qualities, which could set up issues in the relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, he does mention that he's marrying for her personality and other positive traits. But the fact that he's highlighting her virginity as a key reason, especially when he didn't uphold the same standard for himself, points to inconsistency. The friend's criticism is valid in pointing out the hypocrisy. \n\nHowever, whether this makes him in the wrong depends on societal views. Some might argue that personal choices in relationships are up to the individuals involved, and as long as both parties are okay with it, it's fine. But the question here is about the author's perspective being the problem. The friend's reaction suggests that the author's reasoning is problematic, and the author's own admission of hypocrisy might indicate that he's aware of this.\n\nSo, the main issue is the double standard. If he's being judged for it, then yes, he could be in the wrong for that inconsistency. But if the focus is solely on the marriage being happy, maybe not. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong in general. The friend's reaction highlights the hypocrisy, which is a valid point. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
