Now I'll just call her Sofia. My my wife Sofia is beautiful, but most of all, she has a wonderful personality. She is reserved, incredibly kind hearted and mentally strong. She had all the qualities to make a great mother. (we're planning on trying for kids soon). She's Mexican and was born/raised there, and she is quite religious Cahtolic.\n\nNow I'm also Catholic as well, I come from an Irish American Cahtolic background. However it's more of a ''religious in name only'' sort of thing, I somewhat vaguely believe in a deity of some sorts but not really a strong belief in the scripture like my parents. \n\nAnyway, when I first started dating her, the first thing my mates said was literally ''Dude this woman is wifey material''. It became a bit of a running joke, ''wifey material''. \n\nShe seemed like the PERFECT woman and I was a bit persistant when I first met her but eventually she agreed to go on a date from me, from then on it was history because we did have a lot in common. So now we married but one of the reasons I married her, aside from her personality, was that she was a virgin. She didn't sleep around whatsoever, she held out for the ''right guy'' and that guy was me. \n\nSo when I was talking to my female friend (30F) I said that one of the reasons I wanted to marry her was because of her personality AND the fact that she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. I thought this was an okay view to hold but she called me a ''Fucking asshole'' because she pointed out that I slept around in my youth. \n\nIt's true, when I was in my early 20's, I did a lot of sleeping around and hookup culture. And I could have seen myself marrying those girls if I was left with no choice, but they were never my IDEAL choices for partners, so I feel like Sofia was a god send in that regard. My friend (20F) still said I was being a hypocrite however what right does she have to criticize my dating choices? AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for marrying someone because she didn't sleep around, while he had done so in his youth. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author is a 30-year-old man who married a 28-year-old woman. He mentions that one of the reasons he married her was her being a virgin and not sleeping around. However, he admits to sleeping around in his early 20s. His friend called him an asshole for this, leading to the question of whether he's at fault.\n\nThe main issue seems to be hypocrisy. The author is judging his wife's past sexual behavior (or lack thereof) while having his own history of multiple partners. This can be seen as double standards. Even though he married her for her personality and other qualities, the fact that he values her chastity while not holding himself to the same standard might be problematic. \n\nAnother angle is the concept of personal freedom and respect. Everyone has the right to make their own choices regarding relationships, but when those choices involve evaluating others' pasts based on one's own standards without consistency, it can lead to issues. The friend's criticism points out the inconsistency, which the author might be ignoring. \n\nAlso, the author's Catholic background might influence his views, but if his religious practice isn't strict, maybe he's applying certain moral standards without fully adhering to them. However, the core issue is his judgment of Sofia's past versus his own, which could be seen as unfair or hypocritical.\n\nI should also think about societal norms and expectations. While some people value virginity in a partner, others don't. The problem arises when there's a double standard where one person's past is judged more harshly than the other's. The author's justification that he could have married others but found Sofia to be a \"godsend\" might not excuse the hypocrisy. \n\nIn terms of relationships, mutual respect is crucial. If the author is okay with his past but not with his wife's, it could lead to resentment or conflict. Even if Sofia is happy with her choice, the author's personal reasons based on her chastity might indicate deeper issues in how he values his partner's autonomy and choices.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author is being hypocritical by holding his wife to a higher standard that he doesn't apply to himself. Therefore, he's in the wrong because of this double standard, even if his intentions were good. The friend's criticism is valid in pointing out the inconsistency.\n"
