Now I'll just call her Sofia. My my wife Sofia is beautiful, but most of all, she has a wonderful personality. She is reserved, incredibly kind hearted and mentally strong. She had all the qualities to make a great mother. (we're planning on trying for kids soon). She's Mexican and was born/raised there, and she is quite religious Cahtolic.\n\nNow I'm also Catholic as well, I come from an Irish American Cahtolic background. However it's more of a ''religious in name only'' sort of thing, I somewhat vaguely believe in a deity of some sorts but not really a strong belief in the scripture like my parents. \n\nAnyway, when I first started dating her, the first thing my mates said was literally ''Dude this woman is wifey material''. It became a bit of a running joke, ''wifey material''. \n\nShe seemed like the PERFECT woman and I was a bit persistant when I first met her but eventually she agreed to go on a date from me, from then on it was history because we did have a lot in common. So now we married but one of the reasons I married her, aside from her personality, was that she was a virgin. She didn't sleep around whatsoever, she held out for the ''right guy'' and that guy was me. \n\nSo when I was talking to my female friend (30F) I said that one of the reasons I wanted to marry her was because of her personality AND the fact that she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. I thought this was an okay view to hold but she called me a ''Fucking asshole'' because she pointed out that I slept around in my youth. \n\nIt's true, when I was in my early 20's, I did a lot of sleeping around and hookup culture. And I could have seen myself marrying those girls if I was left with no choice, but they were never my IDEAL choices for partners, so I feel like Sofia was a god send in that regard. My friend (20F) still said I was being a hypocrite however what right does she have to criticize my dating choices? AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The scenario is about a man who married a woman because she was a virgin and didn't sleep around, but he himself had a history of sleeping around in his youth. His friend called him an asshole for being hypocritical.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the author married someone he considered \"wifey material\" and valued her virginity. He admits he wasn't a virgin and had a lot of sexual partners before. The question is whether he's being hypocritical by valuing Sofia's chastity while he himself didn't have the same standard. \n\nFirst, I need to consider if valuing a partner's virginity is inherently wrong. Some people do have that as a personal or religious belief. The author mentions being Catholic, though he's not very religious. However, Sofia's Catholicism and her being a virgin might align with his own Catholic upbringing, even if he's not super strict about it. But the problem arises when he judges his past behavior versus his current standards.\n\nHypocrisy is when someone doesn't act in accordance with their stated beliefs. The author says he values Sofia's purity but had a different pattern in his youth. His friend points out that this is hypocritical. But is hypocrisy enough to make him \"in the wrong\"? \n\nIn relationships, it's common for people to have different standards based on personal growth, religion, etc. However, if the author is being discriminatory by holding his wife to a standard he doesn't hold himself to, that could be an issue. For example, if he disapproves of past sexual activity in his partner but is okay with his own, that could be seen as double standards. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that he could have married other women who weren't his ideal choices. This implies he's acknowledging that others might not have met his current standards. But since he's married to Sofia because she did meet them, his friend's criticism is about the inconsistency. \n\nAnother angle is consent and mutual respect in the relationship. If Sofia was aware of his past and they both agree on their values, maybe it's not the author's fault. But if Sofia's virginity is a result of her own choices and he's respecting that, then it's more about his personal beliefs. However, the issue is with his friend's judgment, not Sofia's. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, some might argue that it's okay for individuals to have personal preferences in a partner, as long as they're not hurting anyone. Others might say it's hypocritical and unfair. The key here is whether the author is wrong for holding such views. \n\nReligion plays a role here. Catholicism traditionally values chastity, but the author's adherence is weak. Sofia's Catholicism might be more significant for her. However, the author is applying a moral standard that's more aligned with Sofia's beliefs than his own. But he's still being called out for hypocrisy by a friend. \n\nIs hypocrisy enough to make him \"in the wrong\"? If the friend is just pointing out inconsistency without any harm, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But if he's being discriminatory or disrespectful towards others' choices, that's different. The author doesn't seem to be judging others harshly beyond his own choices. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer might depend on whether hypocrisy is enough to label him as \"in the wrong.\" If the question is about personal morality, the author might not be in the wrong if he's honest with himself and his partner. However, if the question is about societal or ethical standards, hypocrisy could be seen as a flaw. But the friend's reaction is more about pointing out inconsistency rather than wrongdoing. \n\nIn the end, the author is not necessarily in the wrong for having his own preferences and marrying someone who fits them. The hypocrisy is there, but unless it's causing harm or discrimination, it's more of a personal inconsistency than a moral wrong. Therefore, the answer might be B (No).\n"
