Now I'll just call her Sofia. My my wife Sofia is beautiful, but most of all, she has a wonderful personality. She is reserved, incredibly kind hearted and mentally strong. She had all the qualities to make a great mother. (we're planning on trying for kids soon). She's Mexican and was born/raised there, and she is quite religious Cahtolic.\n\nNow I'm also Catholic as well, I come from an Irish American Cahtolic background. However it's more of a ''religious in name only'' sort of thing, I somewhat vaguely believe in a deity of some sorts but not really a strong belief in the scripture like my parents. \n\nAnyway, when I first started dating her, the first thing my mates said was literally ''Dude this woman is wifey material''. It became a bit of a running joke, ''wifey material''. \n\nShe seemed like the PERFECT woman and I was a bit persistant when I first met her but eventually she agreed to go on a date from me, from then on it was history because we did have a lot in common. So now we married but one of the reasons I married her, aside from her personality, was that she was a virgin. She didn't sleep around whatsoever, she held out for the ''right guy'' and that guy was me. \n\nSo when I was talking to my female friend (30F) I said that one of the reasons I wanted to marry her was because of her personality AND the fact that she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. I thought this was an okay view to hold but she called me a ''Fucking asshole'' because she pointed out that I slept around in my youth. \n\nIt's true, when I was in my early 20's, I did a lot of sleeping around and hookup culture. And I could have seen myself marrying those girls if I was left with no choice, but they were never my IDEAL choices for partners, so I feel like Sofia was a god send in that regard. My friend (20F) still said I was being a hypocrite however what right does she have to criticize my dating choices? AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is about whether he's being hypocritical or not. So, the main points are that he married a woman who was a virgin because he wanted someone who didn't sleep around. But he had a history of sleeping around in his early 20s. His friend called him an asshole for this, and he's asking if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the concept of hypocrisy. Hypocrisy is when someone acts in a way that contradicts their own beliefs or actions. In this case, the author is judging his wife's sexual history (valuing her as a virgin) while having a past where he wasn't monogamous. That seems like a contradiction. But does that make him wrong?\n\nAnother angle is the double standard. If he's holding his wife to a standard he doesn't hold himself to, that's a problem. However, he mentions that he wasn't looking to marry those people he hooked up with\u2014they were not his ideal choices. So maybe he's choosing someone who aligns more with his current values, even if his past actions were different. \n\nAlso, the context of their marriage is important. Both are Catholic, albeit with different levels of commitment. His wife's virginity might be important to him due to religious beliefs, even if he's not strictly religious. But his friend's criticism is about his own past, which complicates things. \n\nThe key issue here is whether the author's actions are hypocritical. The friend's reaction is that by valuing his wife's chastity while having a history of promiscuity, he's being hypocritical. The author argues that his past was different and that his current choice is about finding the \"right\" partner. \n\nBut hypocrisy isn't just about past actions versus current values. If he's not applying the same standard to himself as he does to his wife, then he's being inconsistent. The fact that he's proud of his wife's virginity while having a history of not being monogamous could be seen as double standards. However, people can change their values over time. If he's grown and his current values are to choose a partner with a different standard, that's his choice. But the hypocrisy comes from not applying those standards to himself.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It depends on whether his actions are hypocritical. Since he's holding his wife to a standard he doesn't hold himself to (from his past), he might be. However, if he's changed and now values monogamy, maybe it's not about hypocrisy but about his current values. But the fact that he's proud of his wife's chastity while having a history of not being chaste could be seen as double standards. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might be in the wrong for holding a double standard, which is a form of hypocrisy. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
