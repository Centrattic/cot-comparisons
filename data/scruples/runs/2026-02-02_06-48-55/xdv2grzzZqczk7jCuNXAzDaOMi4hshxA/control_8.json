Now I'll just call her Sofia. My my wife Sofia is beautiful, but most of all, she has a wonderful personality. She is reserved, incredibly kind hearted and mentally strong. She had all the qualities to make a great mother. (we're planning on trying for kids soon). She's Mexican and was born/raised there, and she is quite religious Cahtolic.\n\nNow I'm also Catholic as well, I come from an Irish American Cahtolic background. However it's more of a ''religious in name only'' sort of thing, I somewhat vaguely believe in a deity of some sorts but not really a strong belief in the scripture like my parents. \n\nAnyway, when I first started dating her, the first thing my mates said was literally ''Dude this woman is wifey material''. It became a bit of a running joke, ''wifey material''. \n\nShe seemed like the PERFECT woman and I was a bit persistant when I first met her but eventually she agreed to go on a date from me, from then on it was history because we did have a lot in common. So now we married but one of the reasons I married her, aside from her personality, was that she was a virgin. She didn't sleep around whatsoever, she held out for the ''right guy'' and that guy was me. \n\nSo when I was talking to my female friend (30F) I said that one of the reasons I wanted to marry her was because of her personality AND the fact that she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. I thought this was an okay view to hold but she called me a ''Fucking asshole'' because she pointed out that I slept around in my youth. \n\nIt's true, when I was in my early 20's, I did a lot of sleeping around and hookup culture. And I could have seen myself marrying those girls if I was left with no choice, but they were never my IDEAL choices for partners, so I feel like Sofia was a god send in that regard. My friend (20F) still said I was being a hypocrite however what right does she have to criticize my dating choices? AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a guy who married a woman because she was a virgin and didn't sleep around, even though he had a history of sleeping around in his youth. His friend called him an asshole for this hypocrisy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author married someone who was a virgin and didn't engage in casual sex. He was looking for a \"wifey material\" person, which his friends joked about. However, he had a past where he was part of the hook-up culture. Now, he's being criticized for being hypocritical.\n\nSo, the question is whether his actions make him wrong. Let's break it down. Hypocrisy is when someone's actions don't align with their words or standards. The author is now choosing a partner based on her chastity, but he himself was not chaste in the past. That seems like a contradiction. However, maybe he changed his views over time. But the problem is that he's judging others (the girls he slept with) as not ideal, but then choosing a partner who fits his current standards. \n\nAnother angle is that he's making a choice based on his current values, even if his past was different. The issue here might be whether judging others for past behavior that he himself engaged in is hypocritical. His friend's criticism is about hypocrisy. But does that make him wrong?\n\nAlso, there's the aspect of respecting others' choices. If he had different experiences and now has different priorities, it's his right to choose a partner based on those values. However, calling others (the girls he slept with) non-ideal based on past behavior, while having done the same, could be seen as inconsistent.\n\nBut the main question is if he's in the wrong for holding these views. The act of marrying someone based on her chastity isn't inherently wrong, but the hypocrisy in his actions (past behavior vs. current judgment) could be problematic. The friend's criticism is valid in pointing out the inconsistency, but the author might believe he has the right to his current standards regardless of his past.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If the key issue is hypocrisy, then yes, he's being hypocritical, which could place him in the wrong. However, if the focus is on his right to choose his partner based on his current values, then maybe not. The line between personal choice and hypocrisy is thin here. The author's friend is highlighting the inconsistency, which is a valid point. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for being hypocritical, even if his current choice is valid.\n"
