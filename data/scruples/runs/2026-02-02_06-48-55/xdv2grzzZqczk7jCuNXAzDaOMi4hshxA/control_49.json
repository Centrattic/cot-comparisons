Now I'll just call her Sofia. My my wife Sofia is beautiful, but most of all, she has a wonderful personality. She is reserved, incredibly kind hearted and mentally strong. She had all the qualities to make a great mother. (we're planning on trying for kids soon). She's Mexican and was born/raised there, and she is quite religious Cahtolic.\n\nNow I'm also Catholic as well, I come from an Irish American Cahtolic background. However it's more of a ''religious in name only'' sort of thing, I somewhat vaguely believe in a deity of some sorts but not really a strong belief in the scripture like my parents. \n\nAnyway, when I first started dating her, the first thing my mates said was literally ''Dude this woman is wifey material''. It became a bit of a running joke, ''wifey material''. \n\nShe seemed like the PERFECT woman and I was a bit persistant when I first met her but eventually she agreed to go on a date from me, from then on it was history because we did have a lot in common. So now we married but one of the reasons I married her, aside from her personality, was that she was a virgin. She didn't sleep around whatsoever, she held out for the ''right guy'' and that guy was me. \n\nSo when I was talking to my female friend (30F) I said that one of the reasons I wanted to marry her was because of her personality AND the fact that she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. I thought this was an okay view to hold but she called me a ''Fucking asshole'' because she pointed out that I slept around in my youth. \n\nIt's true, when I was in my early 20's, I did a lot of sleeping around and hookup culture. And I could have seen myself marrying those girls if I was left with no choice, but they were never my IDEAL choices for partners, so I feel like Sofia was a god send in that regard. My friend (20F) still said I was being a hypocrite however what right does she have to criticize my dating choices? AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for marrying Sofia because she didn't sleep around, while the author himself had a history of sleeping around in his youth. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author, a 30-year-old man, married Sofia, a 28-year-old Mexican Catholic woman. She's described as a virgin who waited for the \"right guy,\" which was him. The author acknowledges that he was part of hook-up culture in his early 20s but considers Sofia as ideal because she wasn't like the others he dated. He shared this reasoning with a female friend, who criticized him as hypocritical and called him an asshole. The author is now asking if he's in the wrong (AITA).\n\nThe core issue here is about hypocrisy and double standards. The author's friend argues that since he had a history of being promiscuous, his judgment of Sofia's past (or lack thereof) is inconsistent. The author, however, justifies his actions by saying that the other women he considered marrying weren't his ideal choices, and Sofia was a \"godsend.\"\n\nTo determine if he's in the wrong, I need to consider whether his actions are hypocritical and if that makes him at fault. Hypocrisy generally involves holding others to a different standard than oneself. In this case, the author is valuing Sofia's chastity while having a history of not practicing that himself. However, he's not necessarily holding her to a standard he doesn't want for himself; rather, he found her to be the ideal partner in terms of values, which aligns with his current beliefs. \n\nBut the problem arises when he criticizes his past behavior while applying a different standard to others. The friend points out that he was okay with sleeping around before but now judges Sofia's past (even though she didn't sleep around). The key here is whether the author is being hypocritical by valuing his partner's virginity while not upholding the same standard for himself. \n\nAnother angle is the concept of personal growth. The author might have changed his views over time, finding a partner who aligns with his current values. However, the friend's criticism is that he's applying a double standard. The question then becomes whether it's acceptable to change one's standards over time, or if that's still considered hypocrisy.\n\nIn terms of societal views, some might argue that it's okay to have different standards for oneself and one's partner, especially if the individual has evolved. Others might see it as hypocritical because he's using a standard he didn't follow himself. The friend's reaction is valid in pointing out the inconsistency, but the author's reasoning is based on his personal growth and current values.\n\nThe author's justification is that Sofia was his ideal partner, and the fact that she was a virgin made her a better match for him. However, if the author had been promiscuous in the past, does that make his current stance on his partner's behavior hypocritical? It could depend on whether he's applying the same standard to himself now. If he's now committed to monogamy and values chastity in a partner, that's his choice. But if he's using a different standard for his partner than he used for himself in the past, that's where the hypocrisy might lie.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions might be seen as hypocritical by some, but whether he's in the wrong depends on whether the double standard is considered unfair or if it's a personal choice based on his evolution. The friend's criticism is valid, but the author might not be in the wrong if he's genuinely changed his standards. However, the act of praising his partner's chastity while having a past of promiscuity could still be viewed as inconsistent. So, there's a nuance here. The answer could be either A or B depending on perspective, but typically in such scenarios, hypocrisy is seen as a fault. However, personal growth and changing standards are also valid. The friend is right in pointing out the inconsistency, but the author's intention isn't malicious. So, maybe he's not in the wrong, but he's being hypocritical. The question is whether hypocrisy makes him at fault. In AITA scenarios, hypocrisy often isn't the main issue if the person isn't harming anyone. So, maybe the answer is B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
