Now I'll just call her Sofia. My my wife Sofia is beautiful, but most of all, she has a wonderful personality. She is reserved, incredibly kind hearted and mentally strong. She had all the qualities to make a great mother. (we're planning on trying for kids soon). She's Mexican and was born/raised there, and she is quite religious Cahtolic.\n\nNow I'm also Catholic as well, I come from an Irish American Cahtolic background. However it's more of a ''religious in name only'' sort of thing, I somewhat vaguely believe in a deity of some sorts but not really a strong belief in the scripture like my parents. \n\nAnyway, when I first started dating her, the first thing my mates said was literally ''Dude this woman is wifey material''. It became a bit of a running joke, ''wifey material''. \n\nShe seemed like the PERFECT woman and I was a bit persistant when I first met her but eventually she agreed to go on a date from me, from then on it was history because we did have a lot in common. So now we married but one of the reasons I married her, aside from her personality, was that she was a virgin. She didn't sleep around whatsoever, she held out for the ''right guy'' and that guy was me. \n\nSo when I was talking to my female friend (30F) I said that one of the reasons I wanted to marry her was because of her personality AND the fact that she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. I thought this was an okay view to hold but she called me a ''Fucking asshole'' because she pointed out that I slept around in my youth. \n\nIt's true, when I was in my early 20's, I did a lot of sleeping around and hookup culture. And I could have seen myself marrying those girls if I was left with no choice, but they were never my IDEAL choices for partners, so I feel like Sofia was a god send in that regard. My friend (20F) still said I was being a hypocrite however what right does she have to criticize my dating choices? AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for marrying someone because she didn't sleep around, despite his own past of doing so. \n\nFirst, the author admits to sleeping around in his early 20s. Now he married a woman who was a virgin and values her purity. His friend called him an asshole for this hypocrisy.\n\nI need to consider if his reasoning for marrying her is valid. The author mentions that he values her personality, kindness, and other qualities, but also cites her virginity as a key factor. His friend's criticism is about the double standard.\n\nIs it wrong to value a partner's sexual history when you have your own? Some people might argue that holding a double standard is hypocritical. If the author is judging others for their past but is proud of his own, that could be the issue. However, if the author is now in a committed relationship and wants a partner who shares his current values, maybe it's not inherently wrong. \n\nBut the key point here is the hypocrisy. The author is being called out for judging Sofia's past (or lack thereof) while he had a different past. The friend's criticism is valid because he's applying different standards to himself and his wife. The author's reasoning for choosing his wife might be seen as inconsistent with his own history. \n\nAlso, the fact that the author is Catholic adds another layer. The religious aspect might influence his views on virginity, but since he himself isn't strictly religious, it's his personal choice to value her virginity more than his own past actions. This inconsistency could be the main problem.\n\nIn terms of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) context, the community often looks at the intent and the impact. The author's intent was to find a compatible partner, which is normal, but the hypocrisy in his judgment might make him the asshole in the eyes of others. The friend's reaction is a direct callout of that inconsistency.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author is in the wrong for the double standard. He's applying different moral standards to himself and his wife, which is hypocritical. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n"
