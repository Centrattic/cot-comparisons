Now I'll just call her Sofia. My my wife Sofia is beautiful, but most of all, she has a wonderful personality. She is reserved, incredibly kind hearted and mentally strong. She had all the qualities to make a great mother. (we're planning on trying for kids soon). She's Mexican and was born/raised there, and she is quite religious Cahtolic.\n\nNow I'm also Catholic as well, I come from an Irish American Cahtolic background. However it's more of a ''religious in name only'' sort of thing, I somewhat vaguely believe in a deity of some sorts but not really a strong belief in the scripture like my parents. \n\nAnyway, when I first started dating her, the first thing my mates said was literally ''Dude this woman is wifey material''. It became a bit of a running joke, ''wifey material''. \n\nShe seemed like the PERFECT woman and I was a bit persistant when I first met her but eventually she agreed to go on a date from me, from then on it was history because we did have a lot in common. So now we married but one of the reasons I married her, aside from her personality, was that she was a virgin. She didn't sleep around whatsoever, she held out for the ''right guy'' and that guy was me. \n\nSo when I was talking to my female friend (30F) I said that one of the reasons I wanted to marry her was because of her personality AND the fact that she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. I thought this was an okay view to hold but she called me a ''Fucking asshole'' because she pointed out that I slept around in my youth. \n\nIt's true, when I was in my early 20's, I did a lot of sleeping around and hookup culture. And I could have seen myself marrying those girls if I was left with no choice, but they were never my IDEAL choices for partners, so I feel like Sofia was a god send in that regard. My friend (20F) still said I was being a hypocrite however what right does she have to criticize my dating choices? AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for marrying someone because she didn't sleep around, despite his own past of doing so. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author married Sofia partly because she was a virgin, valuing her for not sleeping around. His friend criticized him as hypocritical because he had a history of similar behavior. The author justifies this by saying he wasn't being hypocritical because he didn't marry those other women, and he's just happy to have found Sofia.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Hypocrisy is a common angle here. He judges Sofia's past (valuing her chastity) while having his own history of promiscuity. Some might argue that holding different standards for oneself and one's partner is unfair. But others might say that personal values can change over time, and people can choose partners based on their own criteria, even if their past differs.\n\nAnother angle is the double standard. If the author values Sofia's virginity, but he himself has a different past, is that discriminatory? It could be seen as holding her to a standard he doesn't apply to himself. However, he's not necessarily wrong in having his own preferences, but others might criticize the inconsistency.\n\nAlso, the friend's criticism was about being an asshole for this double standard. The author might argue that he's made his own choices and it's not his friend's place to judge. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong, not his friend.\n\nIn terms of moral judgment, it's subjective. Some would say that people can evolve and have different values now, so his choice isn't wrong. Others might say that using someone's sexual history as a key factor in marriage while having a similar past is hypocritical and unfair. The fact that Sofia is happy with the marriage might also be a point in his favor.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer could go either way. However, the key here is whether the author's actions are in the wrong. Hypocrisy is a social judgment, but whether it's morally wrong is another matter. The author's friend called him an asshole, but the author might not see it that way. In many cases, this kind of situation is seen as the author being hypocritical, but not necessarily in the wrong if both parties are content. However, the question is about whether he's in the wrong. In many discussions like this, the common answer is that he's not wrong, as long as both people are happy and consent. So the answer is B.\n"
