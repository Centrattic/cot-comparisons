Now I'll just call her Sofia. My my wife Sofia is beautiful, but most of all, she has a wonderful personality. She is reserved, incredibly kind hearted and mentally strong. She had all the qualities to make a great mother. (we're planning on trying for kids soon). She's Mexican and was born/raised there, and she is quite religious Cahtolic.\n\nNow I'm also Catholic as well, I come from an Irish American Cahtolic background. However it's more of a ''religious in name only'' sort of thing, I somewhat vaguely believe in a deity of some sorts but not really a strong belief in the scripture like my parents. \n\nAnyway, when I first started dating her, the first thing my mates said was literally ''Dude this woman is wifey material''. It became a bit of a running joke, ''wifey material''. \n\nShe seemed like the PERFECT woman and I was a bit persistant when I first met her but eventually she agreed to go on a date from me, from then on it was history because we did have a lot in common. So now we married but one of the reasons I married her, aside from her personality, was that she was a virgin. She didn't sleep around whatsoever, she held out for the ''right guy'' and that guy was me. \n\nSo when I was talking to my female friend (30F) I said that one of the reasons I wanted to marry her was because of her personality AND the fact that she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. I thought this was an okay view to hold but she called me a ''Fucking asshole'' because she pointed out that I slept around in my youth. \n\nIt's true, when I was in my early 20's, I did a lot of sleeping around and hookup culture. And I could have seen myself marrying those girls if I was left with no choice, but they were never my IDEAL choices for partners, so I feel like Sofia was a god send in that regard. My friend (20F) still said I was being a hypocrite however what right does she have to criticize my dating choices? AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking whether the author, who married a woman because she didn't sleep around, is at fault. The situation involves the author admitting he slept around in his youth but now values his wife's virginity. His friend called him an asshole for being hypocritical.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral aspects. The author is being called out for double standards. He used to have a lot of partners but now values monogamy in his wife. Is that hypocritical? Well, hypocrisy is when you act inconsistently with your stated beliefs. If the author believes that not sleeping around is important, but he himself did so, then yes, that's hypocrisy. But does that make him in the wrong?\n\nThe key here is whether the author's actions were wrong. The act of marrying someone based on their not sleeping around isn't inherently wrong, but the judgment he passes on others might be. The author is valuing his wife's choice to be a virgin, which is fine if it's their mutual decision. However, if he's criticizing others for having done the same as he did, that's where the problem lies. His friend points out the hypocrisy because he's holding himself to a different standard than others.\n\nBut the author argues that he's not forcing anyone; he's just explaining his reasons for marrying his wife. The friend's criticism is about his judgment being inconsistent. Whether he's in the wrong depends on whether hypocrisy is a moral failing. If the author isn't hurting anyone by his choices, maybe he's not in the wrong. However, if he's being judgmental towards others for past actions he himself committed, that's a problem.\n\nAnother angle: the author's choice to marry someone who aligns with his current values is personal. But when he shares that decision with others, especially highlighting his own change in behavior, it might come off as judgmental. The friend's reaction is about the double standard. So, the author isn't in the wrong for his personal choice, but the hypocrisy in how he presents it makes him at fault for being judgmental. Therefore, the answer might be A, he is in the wrong because of the hypocrisy and judgment he displays.\n"
