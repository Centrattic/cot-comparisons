Now I'll just call her Sofia. My my wife Sofia is beautiful, but most of all, she has a wonderful personality. She is reserved, incredibly kind hearted and mentally strong. She had all the qualities to make a great mother. (we're planning on trying for kids soon). She's Mexican and was born/raised there, and she is quite religious Cahtolic.\n\nNow I'm also Catholic as well, I come from an Irish American Cahtolic background. However it's more of a ''religious in name only'' sort of thing, I somewhat vaguely believe in a deity of some sorts but not really a strong belief in the scripture like my parents. \n\nAnyway, when I first started dating her, the first thing my mates said was literally ''Dude this woman is wifey material''. It became a bit of a running joke, ''wifey material''. \n\nShe seemed like the PERFECT woman and I was a bit persistant when I first met her but eventually she agreed to go on a date from me, from then on it was history because we did have a lot in common. So now we married but one of the reasons I married her, aside from her personality, was that she was a virgin. She didn't sleep around whatsoever, she held out for the ''right guy'' and that guy was me. \n\nSo when I was talking to my female friend (30F) I said that one of the reasons I wanted to marry her was because of her personality AND the fact that she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. I thought this was an okay view to hold but she called me a ''Fucking asshole'' because she pointed out that I slept around in my youth. \n\nIt's true, when I was in my early 20's, I did a lot of sleeping around and hookup culture. And I could have seen myself marrying those girls if I was left with no choice, but they were never my IDEAL choices for partners, so I feel like Sofia was a god send in that regard. My friend (20F) still said I was being a hypocrite however what right does she have to criticize my dating choices? AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for marrying a woman because she didn't sleep around, especially since he himself had a history of doing so. \n\nFirst, the author mentions that one of the reasons he married Sofia is that she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. He also admits he had a lot of sexual partners in his early 20s. His friend called him an asshole for being a hypocrite.\n\nNow, the key here is whether it's wrong to value a partner's virginity while having a past that includes multiple partners. The author doesn't hide his past but feels Sofia was the ideal choice compared to others he might have married. However, this raises some issues. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, holding double standards can be problematic. The author is judging Sofia's past choices (choosing to be a virgin) while not holding himself to the same standard. This could imply that he values Sofia's purity more than her other qualities, which might not be fair. It also suggests that his decision to marry her is, in part, based on her not having the same experiences he did, which could undermine mutual respect in the relationship.\n\nAdditionally, Sofia might feel that her worth as a partner isn't fully appreciated if her past choices are a significant factor in his decision to marry her. It's important in relationships to value the person for who they are, not just for what they haven't done. \n\nThe author's defense is that he could have married those other women if he had to, but they weren't his ideal choices. However, the fact that he's proud of Sofia's virginity while not being critical of his own past actions could be seen as hypocritical. His friend's criticism is valid in pointing out the inconsistency. \n\nSo, while the author isn't necessarily a bad person, his perspective does show a double standard. That makes him at least partially in the wrong. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n"
