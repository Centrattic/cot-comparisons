Now I'll just call her Sofia. My my wife Sofia is beautiful, but most of all, she has a wonderful personality. She is reserved, incredibly kind hearted and mentally strong. She had all the qualities to make a great mother. (we're planning on trying for kids soon). She's Mexican and was born/raised there, and she is quite religious Cahtolic.\n\nNow I'm also Catholic as well, I come from an Irish American Cahtolic background. However it's more of a ''religious in name only'' sort of thing, I somewhat vaguely believe in a deity of some sorts but not really a strong belief in the scripture like my parents. \n\nAnyway, when I first started dating her, the first thing my mates said was literally ''Dude this woman is wifey material''. It became a bit of a running joke, ''wifey material''. \n\nShe seemed like the PERFECT woman and I was a bit persistant when I first met her but eventually she agreed to go on a date from me, from then on it was history because we did have a lot in common. So now we married but one of the reasons I married her, aside from her personality, was that she was a virgin. She didn't sleep around whatsoever, she held out for the ''right guy'' and that guy was me. \n\nSo when I was talking to my female friend (30F) I said that one of the reasons I wanted to marry her was because of her personality AND the fact that she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. I thought this was an okay view to hold but she called me a ''Fucking asshole'' because she pointed out that I slept around in my youth. \n\nIt's true, when I was in my early 20's, I did a lot of sleeping around and hookup culture. And I could have seen myself marrying those girls if I was left with no choice, but they were never my IDEAL choices for partners, so I feel like Sofia was a god send in that regard. My friend (20F) still said I was being a hypocrite however what right does she have to criticize my dating choices? AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the married man) is in the wrong for admitting that one of the reasons he married his wife was because she didn't sleep around, while he had a history of doing so. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives. The author is Catholic, though not very devout. His wife is Catholic and a virgin. He married her partly because she was a virgin, despite his own past. His friend criticized him for being a hypocrite.\n\nNow, is he wrong? Well, the key issue is hypocrisy. He had a history of casual relationships and now values monogamy. He's being called out for holding a double standard. But is that hypocrisy, or is he simply changing his priorities as he matures?\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, if someone evolves and changes their views, that's not necessarily wrong. However, using someone else's virginity as a reason to marry them while having a different past could be seen as insincere or double standard. The friend's criticism is about hypocrisy, which is a valid point. But the author might argue that he's grown and that his current values are genuine.\n\nAlso, the context matters. If the wife is perfectly okay with his reasons, then maybe it's not his wrong. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, not the wife. The friend's judgment is about his past actions versus his current standards. \n\nIn terms of social norms, people often change their priorities as they age. The problem arises when someone judges others for past behavior that they themselves engaged in. The author might be seen as inconsistent, but not necessarily in the wrong if he's genuine in his current intentions.\n\nSo, the answer could swing either way. However, the friend's point about hypocrisy is valid. The author is being called out for having a different standard for himself and his partner. That's a classic case of double standards, which is a form of hypocrisy. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
