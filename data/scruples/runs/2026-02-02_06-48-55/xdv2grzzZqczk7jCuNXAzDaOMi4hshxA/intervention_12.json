Now I'll just call her Sofia. My my wife Sofia is beautiful, but most of all, she has a wonderful personality. She is reserved, incredibly kind hearted and mentally strong. She had all the qualities to make a great mother. (we're planning on trying for kids soon). She's Mexican and was born/raised there, and she is quite religious Cahtolic.\n\nNow I'm also Catholic as well, I come from an Irish American Cahtolic background. However it's more of a ''religious in name only'' sort of thing, I somewhat vaguely believe in a deity of some sorts but not really a strong belief in the scripture like my parents. \n\nAnyway, when I first started dating her, the first thing my mates said was literally ''Dude this woman is wifey material''. It became a bit of a running joke, ''wifey material''. \n\nShe seemed like the PERFECT woman and I was a bit persistant when I first met her but eventually she agreed to go on a date from me, from then on it was history because we did have a lot in common. So now we married but one of the reasons I married her, aside from her personality, was that she was a virgin. She didn't sleep around whatsoever, she held out for the ''right guy'' and that guy was me. \n\nSo when I was talking to my female friend (30F) I said that one of the reasons I wanted to marry her was because of her personality AND the fact that she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. I thought this was an okay view to hold but she called me a ''Fucking asshole'' because she pointed out that I slept around in my youth. \n\nIt's true, when I was in my early 20's, I did a lot of sleeping around and hookup culture. And I could have seen myself marrying those girls if I was left with no choice, but they were never my IDEAL choices for partners, so I feel like Sofia was a god send in that regard. My friend (20F) still said I was being a hypocrite however what right does she have to criticize my dating choices? AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for marrying his wife because she didn't sleep around, even though he did when he was younger. The author is male, 30, married to a 28-year-old woman named Sofia. He's Catholic but not very religious, while she's more devout. He mentions that one of the reasons he married her was because she was a virgin and didn't sleep around, which he sees as positive. However, his friend calls him an asshole for this because he admits he slept around in his early 20s. The author is confused because he feels like Sofia was a better choice than others he could have married.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The key points are hypocrisy and double standards. The author is judging his wife's past sexual behavior (being a virgin) as a positive, but he himself had a history of sleeping around. His friend points out the hypocrisy, which is a valid point. The question is whether this makes the author wrong.\n\nIn many cultures and ethical frameworks, double standards are frowned upon. If someone holds others to a different standard than themselves, especially in areas like personal conduct or morality, it can be considered hypocritical. The author is valuing Sofia's virginity but not holding himself to the same standard. This could be seen as judgmental or unfair. \n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of personal choice in marriage. The author is allowed to choose his spouse based on his own values. If he genuinely believes that Sofia's values align with his own (even if they aren't strictly religious), that's his right. But the issue arises when he criticizes his own past behavior while marrying someone who adheres to those values. The friend's criticism highlights that inconsistency.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of respect and respect for others' choices. If the author is okay with his past but not Sofia's, that could indicate a lack of respect for others' lifestyles. It's important in relationships to avoid imposing one's own moral standards on a partner, unless they mutually agree on those values. Since Sofia is Catholic and a virgin by choice, maybe they both agree on that aspect, but the author's admission of hypocrisy could be problematic in how he views others.\n\nAlso, the friend's reaction might be valid in pointing out the inconsistency, but the author could argue that he's made a change and is now committed to a monogamous relationship. However, the fact remains that he's applying different standards to himself and his spouse. That inconsistency is the core of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) question.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the author is being hypocritical. While it's his right to choose his spouse based on his values, the hypocrisy in his judgment of his own past versus his spouse's present makes him at least partially in the wrong. Therefore, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
