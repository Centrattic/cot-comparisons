Now I'll just call her Sofia. My my wife Sofia is beautiful, but most of all, she has a wonderful personality. She is reserved, incredibly kind hearted and mentally strong. She had all the qualities to make a great mother. (we're planning on trying for kids soon). She's Mexican and was born/raised there, and she is quite religious Cahtolic.\n\nNow I'm also Catholic as well, I come from an Irish American Cahtolic background. However it's more of a ''religious in name only'' sort of thing, I somewhat vaguely believe in a deity of some sorts but not really a strong belief in the scripture like my parents. \n\nAnyway, when I first started dating her, the first thing my mates said was literally ''Dude this woman is wifey material''. It became a bit of a running joke, ''wifey material''. \n\nShe seemed like the PERFECT woman and I was a bit persistant when I first met her but eventually she agreed to go on a date from me, from then on it was history because we did have a lot in common. So now we married but one of the reasons I married her, aside from her personality, was that she was a virgin. She didn't sleep around whatsoever, she held out for the ''right guy'' and that guy was me. \n\nSo when I was talking to my female friend (30F) I said that one of the reasons I wanted to marry her was because of her personality AND the fact that she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. I thought this was an okay view to hold but she called me a ''Fucking asshole'' because she pointed out that I slept around in my youth. \n\nIt's true, when I was in my early 20's, I did a lot of sleeping around and hookup culture. And I could have seen myself marrying those girls if I was left with no choice, but they were never my IDEAL choices for partners, so I feel like Sofia was a god send in that regard. My friend (20F) still said I was being a hypocrite however what right does she have to criticize my dating choices? AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about someone marrying a woman because she didn't sleep around, while he himself had a history of doing so. The question is whether he's being hypocritical, and thus in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is a 30-year-old man who married Sofia, a 28-year-old Catholic Mexican woman. He mentions that one of the reasons he married her was because she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. However, he admits that in his early 20s, he was involved in \"sleeping around and hookup culture.\" His friend called him an asshole for this hypocrisy.\n\nSo the main issue here is hypocrisy. He's judging his wife based on her sexual history, but he himself has a similar past. The question is whether that makes him in the wrong. \n\nNow, let's consider the concept of hypocrisy. Hypocrisy occurs when someone holds others to a standard they don't hold themselves to. In this case, the author is valuing Sofia for her virginity and not having slept around, while he himself had done so. If he's using that as a reason to criticize her or to justify his choice, then he's being hypocritical. However, the situation isn't straightforward because he's choosing a partner who aligns with his current values. \n\nWait, but the problem is that his values might have changed. When he was younger, he had a different set of behaviors, but now he values someone who is more reserved. The issue is whether it's hypocritical to now value that in a partner while he himself has a past that contradicts that. \n\nAnother angle is the right to make personal choices. The author is not necessarily wrong for choosing a spouse who fits his current ideals. However, the problem arises when he criticizes his own past actions while expecting his current partner to have a different history. That's where the hypocrisy comes in. \n\nBut here's the thing: people can change their values over time. Just because he had a different lifestyle before doesn't mean he can't now value a partner with different standards. The key is whether he's being inconsistent in his standards. If he's judging his past self and his current partner by different standards, that's where the issue lies. \n\nHowever, the friend's criticism is that he's a hypocrite because he was doing the same thing in the past. So the question is, is it hypocritical to value a partner who doesn't have the same history when he himself had it? The answer might depend on whether the double standard is unjust. \n\nIf the author is okay with his own past but holds his wife to a higher standard, that's a double standard. But if he now personally upholds a higher standard for himself and his future partner, even if he didn't in the past, then it's not necessarily hypocritical. However, the problem is that he's now applying that standard to his wife but not to himself. \n\nWait, but the author is not necessarily applying the same standard to himself. He might have changed. The key is that if he's now in a committed relationship and wants a partner who aligns with his current values, that's acceptable. However, the hypocrisy comes into play when he criticizes his own past behavior while expecting his wife to have a different history. \n\nSo the author is in the wrong because he's being hypocritical by holding his wife to a standard he himself didn't follow in the past. The friend's point is valid because if he's now valuing someone who didn't sleep around, but he himself did, then he's being inconsistent. Unless he's choosing a partner who aligns with his current values and not necessarily judging his past self, but the problem is that he's using his past to justify his current choice, which is hypocritical. \n\nTherefore, the answer is that the author is in the wrong because he's being hypocritical. His friend is right to point out the inconsistency in his values. So the answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
