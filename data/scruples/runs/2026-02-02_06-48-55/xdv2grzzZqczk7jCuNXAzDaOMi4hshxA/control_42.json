Now I'll just call her Sofia. My my wife Sofia is beautiful, but most of all, she has a wonderful personality. She is reserved, incredibly kind hearted and mentally strong. She had all the qualities to make a great mother. (we're planning on trying for kids soon). She's Mexican and was born/raised there, and she is quite religious Cahtolic.\n\nNow I'm also Catholic as well, I come from an Irish American Cahtolic background. However it's more of a ''religious in name only'' sort of thing, I somewhat vaguely believe in a deity of some sorts but not really a strong belief in the scripture like my parents. \n\nAnyway, when I first started dating her, the first thing my mates said was literally ''Dude this woman is wifey material''. It became a bit of a running joke, ''wifey material''. \n\nShe seemed like the PERFECT woman and I was a bit persistant when I first met her but eventually she agreed to go on a date from me, from then on it was history because we did have a lot in common. So now we married but one of the reasons I married her, aside from her personality, was that she was a virgin. She didn't sleep around whatsoever, she held out for the ''right guy'' and that guy was me. \n\nSo when I was talking to my female friend (30F) I said that one of the reasons I wanted to marry her was because of her personality AND the fact that she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. I thought this was an okay view to hold but she called me a ''Fucking asshole'' because she pointed out that I slept around in my youth. \n\nIt's true, when I was in my early 20's, I did a lot of sleeping around and hookup culture. And I could have seen myself marrying those girls if I was left with no choice, but they were never my IDEAL choices for partners, so I feel like Sofia was a god send in that regard. My friend (20F) still said I was being a hypocrite however what right does she have to criticize my dating choices? AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for marrying someone because she didn't sleep around, while he had a history of doing so. \n\nFirst, the author is a guy who married Sofia, a Catholic woman who was a virgin. He admitted to sleeping around in his early 20s. His friend called him an asshole for valuing Sofia's virginity, pointing out his own past.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, the issue here is hypocrisy. He's judging Sofia's past based on his religious beliefs, but he himself had a different past. The user wants to know if that makes him wrong. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, hypocrisy is usually frowned upon. If someone uses a standard for others that they don't apply to themselves, that's a problem. The author is being double-standard by criticizing Sofia for his own past behavior. \n\nAlso, the friend's criticism is valid because the author is holding Sofia to a standard he didn't maintain himself. Even if he changed his ways, the fact that he's proud of her for something he did himself is hypocritical. \n\nBut maybe there's another angle. The author might have had a change of heart and found someone who aligns with his current values. That's fair, but the hypocrisy is still there in the comparison. \n\nSo, the answer is likely A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because he's being hypocritical, even if his intentions are good. The friend's point is that he's inconsistent in his standards, which is a valid criticism.\n"
