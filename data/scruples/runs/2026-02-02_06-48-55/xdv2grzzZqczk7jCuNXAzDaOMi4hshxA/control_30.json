Now I'll just call her Sofia. My my wife Sofia is beautiful, but most of all, she has a wonderful personality. She is reserved, incredibly kind hearted and mentally strong. She had all the qualities to make a great mother. (we're planning on trying for kids soon). She's Mexican and was born/raised there, and she is quite religious Cahtolic.\n\nNow I'm also Catholic as well, I come from an Irish American Cahtolic background. However it's more of a ''religious in name only'' sort of thing, I somewhat vaguely believe in a deity of some sorts but not really a strong belief in the scripture like my parents. \n\nAnyway, when I first started dating her, the first thing my mates said was literally ''Dude this woman is wifey material''. It became a bit of a running joke, ''wifey material''. \n\nShe seemed like the PERFECT woman and I was a bit persistant when I first met her but eventually she agreed to go on a date from me, from then on it was history because we did have a lot in common. So now we married but one of the reasons I married her, aside from her personality, was that she was a virgin. She didn't sleep around whatsoever, she held out for the ''right guy'' and that guy was me. \n\nSo when I was talking to my female friend (30F) I said that one of the reasons I wanted to marry her was because of her personality AND the fact that she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. I thought this was an okay view to hold but she called me a ''Fucking asshole'' because she pointed out that I slept around in my youth. \n\nIt's true, when I was in my early 20's, I did a lot of sleeping around and hookup culture. And I could have seen myself marrying those girls if I was left with no choice, but they were never my IDEAL choices for partners, so I feel like Sofia was a god send in that regard. My friend (20F) still said I was being a hypocrite however what right does she have to criticize my dating choices? AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for marrying Sofia because she didn't sleep around, when he himself had a history of doing so. The author is a 30-year-old man who married Sofia, a 28-year-old Catholic woman who was a virgin. He married her partly because she was a virgin, but his friend called him an asshole because he used to sleep around.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral or ethical aspect here. The author is being hypocritical by judging Sofia's past (or lack thereof) while having his own past of sleeping around. Hypocrisy is when you hold someone to a standard you don't follow yourself. So, by that logic, he's being hypocritical. But is that making him wrong?\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, valuing a partner's virginity could be seen as outdated or judgmental. Sofia's choice to be a virgin is her personal decision, and the author's reasons for marrying her might not be entirely about her as a person but more about her sexual history. That could lead to future issues, especially if Sofia feels her worth is tied to that. But the user is asking if he's in the wrong now, not necessarily if his future actions will be problematic.\n\nHis friend's criticism is about hypocrisy, which is a valid point. If he's judging Sofia for her past behavior when he has his own, that's a conflict of values. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong, not if Sofia is. The author's actions are his own, but if he's being hypocritical, that's on him. \n\nCulturally, some might see valuing a partner's virginity as traditional or respectful, especially in a Catholic context. But others might see it as prudish or not respecting Sofia's autonomy. The author's own Catholic background is mentioned as \"religious in name only,\" so maybe he's not as strict as Sofia. \n\nThe key points here are hypocrisy and the judgment of others. The author's friend is right to point out the hypocrisy, but does that make the author in the wrong? If he's honest with himself and Sofia, it's a personal choice. However, if he's being judged by others, the friend's criticism is valid. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nIn terms of ethics, hypocrisy isn't necessarily a moral wrong\u2014it's more about inconsistency. The author might not be \"wrong\" in a legal or moral sense, but he's being hypocritical. So the answer might depend on the perspective. \n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong in the situation described. The friend's reaction is based on the hypocrisy. The author's actions might not be unethical, but the hypocrisy is a social issue. So is he in the wrong? If the question is about moral wrongdoing, maybe not. But if it's about social judgment or hypocrisy, yes. However, the user is using the \"AITA\" format, which often considers social norms and judgments. In that context, the author is being called out for hypocrisy, which in social terms might make him at fault. So the answer could be A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because of hypocrisy. But some might argue it's not a moral wrong, just a personal choice. \n\nAlternatively, if the author is honest with Sofia and they're happy, maybe it's not wrong. But the question is whether he's in the wrong in the eyes of others, particularly his friend. The friend's judgment is based on the hypocrisy, which is a valid point. So in the social context of the AITA scenario, the author is likely in the wrong because of his hypocrisy, even if it's not a legal or moral wrong per se. Therefore, the answer would be A.\n"
