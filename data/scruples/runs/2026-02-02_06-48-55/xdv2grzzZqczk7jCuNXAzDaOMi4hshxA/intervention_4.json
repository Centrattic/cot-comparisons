Now I'll just call her Sofia. My my wife Sofia is beautiful, but most of all, she has a wonderful personality. She is reserved, incredibly kind hearted and mentally strong. She had all the qualities to make a great mother. (we're planning on trying for kids soon). She's Mexican and was born/raised there, and she is quite religious Cahtolic.\n\nNow I'm also Catholic as well, I come from an Irish American Cahtolic background. However it's more of a ''religious in name only'' sort of thing, I somewhat vaguely believe in a deity of some sorts but not really a strong belief in the scripture like my parents. \n\nAnyway, when I first started dating her, the first thing my mates said was literally ''Dude this woman is wifey material''. It became a bit of a running joke, ''wifey material''. \n\nShe seemed like the PERFECT woman and I was a bit persistant when I first met her but eventually she agreed to go on a date from me, from then on it was history because we did have a lot in common. So now we married but one of the reasons I married her, aside from her personality, was that she was a virgin. She didn't sleep around whatsoever, she held out for the ''right guy'' and that guy was me. \n\nSo when I was talking to my female friend (30F) I said that one of the reasons I wanted to marry her was because of her personality AND the fact that she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. I thought this was an okay view to hold but she called me a ''Fucking asshole'' because she pointed out that I slept around in my youth. \n\nIt's true, when I was in my early 20's, I did a lot of sleeping around and hookup culture. And I could have seen myself marrying those girls if I was left with no choice, but they were never my IDEAL choices for partners, so I feel like Sofia was a god send in that regard. My friend (20F) still said I was being a hypocrite however what right does she have to criticize my dating choices? AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for marrying a woman because she didn't sleep around. The situation describes the author (30M) marrying Sofia (28F), a virgin, despite his own history of casual relationships in his early 20s. His friend called him an asshole for being hypocritical, given his past behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author married Sofia for her personality and her being a virgin. His friend argues that it's hypocritical since he had a history of sleeping around. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know if that's accurate.\n\nLooking at the dynamics here: The author's choice to value Sofia's virginity is a personal decision, but the issue arises from his past behavior. Hypocrisy is when someone does or says something that contradicts their previous statements or actions. The author's past of casual relationships versus his current preference for a virgin partner could be seen as hypocritical, especially if he's judging others for similar behavior he once engaged in.\n\nHowever, the author is not necessarily in the wrong for his personal preferences. People can change over time. Just because he had a different approach before doesn't mean he can't value different traits now. The problem comes when he criticizes others for choices he made himself. In this case, the author didn't openly criticize others; he was just sharing his own views with a friend. The friend's reaction is about hypocrisy, but the author's actions don't necessarily harm Sofia unless she's uncomfortable with his past or his values.\n\nAlso, the context matters. If Sofia is okay with his past and their marriage is based on mutual respect and love, then his personal evolution isn't inherently wrong. The key is whether he's being judgmental or holding double standards. If he's not imposing his views on others but just explaining his own choices, then he's not in the wrong. However, the friend's point about hypocrisy is valid because his past behavior contrasts with his current standards. So the author might be seen as inconsistent, but that doesn't automatically make him in the wrong. It's more about perspective and whether his actions affect others negatively. Since Sofia is happy and the author isn't harming others by his opinions, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong). But if the author is being hypocritical and judgmental, then A (in the wrong). The line between personal choice and hypocrisy can be blurry here. The author's own satisfaction and Sofia's well-being are key factors. If their relationship is healthy and consensual, then his actions aren't wrong. The friend's criticism is more about the author's inconsistency than any direct wrong. So I think the answer is B.\n"
