Now I'll just call her Sofia. My my wife Sofia is beautiful, but most of all, she has a wonderful personality. She is reserved, incredibly kind hearted and mentally strong. She had all the qualities to make a great mother. (we're planning on trying for kids soon). She's Mexican and was born/raised there, and she is quite religious Cahtolic.\n\nNow I'm also Catholic as well, I come from an Irish American Cahtolic background. However it's more of a ''religious in name only'' sort of thing, I somewhat vaguely believe in a deity of some sorts but not really a strong belief in the scripture like my parents. \n\nAnyway, when I first started dating her, the first thing my mates said was literally ''Dude this woman is wifey material''. It became a bit of a running joke, ''wifey material''. \n\nShe seemed like the PERFECT woman and I was a bit persistant when I first met her but eventually she agreed to go on a date from me, from then on it was history because we did have a lot in common. So now we married but one of the reasons I married her, aside from her personality, was that she was a virgin. She didn't sleep around whatsoever, she held out for the ''right guy'' and that guy was me. \n\nSo when I was talking to my female friend (30F) I said that one of the reasons I wanted to marry her was because of her personality AND the fact that she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. I thought this was an okay view to hold but she called me a ''Fucking asshole'' because she pointed out that I slept around in my youth. \n\nIt's true, when I was in my early 20's, I did a lot of sleeping around and hookup culture. And I could have seen myself marrying those girls if I was left with no choice, but they were never my IDEAL choices for partners, so I feel like Sofia was a god send in that regard. My friend (20F) still said I was being a hypocrite however what right does she have to criticize my dating choices? AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to work through this. So, the person is asking if they're in the wrong for marrying a woman because she didn't sleep around, even though they did when they were younger. \n\nFirst, the author is a 30-year-old man who married a 28-year-old woman from Mexico, who is Catholic and a virgin. He mentions that one of the reasons he married her was her personality and the fact that she was a virgin. He also admits that he had a lot of sexual partners in his early 20s but now sees his wife as the ideal choice. His friend called him an asshole for being hypocritical.\n\nHmm, so the main issue here is hypocrisy. The author is criticizing his wife's past (or lack thereof, since she didn't sleep around) but has a history of doing so himself. The question is whether that makes him in the wrong.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, hypocrisy can be a problem. If someone judges another for something they themselves have done, that's usually seen as wrong. The author is holding his wife to a standard he doesn't hold himself to. Even if he's changed his ways now, the fact remains that he had a different past. It might be okay if he's being honest with himself and his partner, but if he's using his own past to justify his current standards, that's where the problem lies.\n\nAlso, the woman's choice to be a virgin and the author's choice to have multiple partners are both personal decisions. The issue here is the double standard. The author might not be in the wrong if both parties agreed and are happy, but the hypocrisy in judgment is the key. His friend is pointing out that he's being a hypocrite, which is a valid point. So, the author is in the wrong for that hypocrisy.\n"
