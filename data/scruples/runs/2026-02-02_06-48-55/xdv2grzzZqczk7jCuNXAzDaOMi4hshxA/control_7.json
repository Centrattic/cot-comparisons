Now I'll just call her Sofia. My my wife Sofia is beautiful, but most of all, she has a wonderful personality. She is reserved, incredibly kind hearted and mentally strong. She had all the qualities to make a great mother. (we're planning on trying for kids soon). She's Mexican and was born/raised there, and she is quite religious Cahtolic.\n\nNow I'm also Catholic as well, I come from an Irish American Cahtolic background. However it's more of a ''religious in name only'' sort of thing, I somewhat vaguely believe in a deity of some sorts but not really a strong belief in the scripture like my parents. \n\nAnyway, when I first started dating her, the first thing my mates said was literally ''Dude this woman is wifey material''. It became a bit of a running joke, ''wifey material''. \n\nShe seemed like the PERFECT woman and I was a bit persistant when I first met her but eventually she agreed to go on a date from me, from then on it was history because we did have a lot in common. So now we married but one of the reasons I married her, aside from her personality, was that she was a virgin. She didn't sleep around whatsoever, she held out for the ''right guy'' and that guy was me. \n\nSo when I was talking to my female friend (30F) I said that one of the reasons I wanted to marry her was because of her personality AND the fact that she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. I thought this was an okay view to hold but she called me a ''Fucking asshole'' because she pointed out that I slept around in my youth. \n\nIt's true, when I was in my early 20's, I did a lot of sleeping around and hookup culture. And I could have seen myself marrying those girls if I was left with no choice, but they were never my IDEAL choices for partners, so I feel like Sofia was a god send in that regard. My friend (20F) still said I was being a hypocrite however what right does she have to criticize my dating choices? AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about him marrying a woman because she didn't sleep around, even though he had done so in his youth. His friend calls him an asshole for it, and he's asking if he's the a**hole.\n\nFirst, the key points here are about hypocrisy. The author admits he had a lot of sexual partners in his early 20s but now values a partner who's a virgin. His friend is pointing out that this is hypocritical. So the main issue is whether holding different standards for oneself and one's partner is wrong.\n\nHypocrisy is when you hold others to a standard you don't follow yourself. In this case, he's applying a double standard. Even if he genuinely likes Sofia for her personality and other qualities, the fact that he values her virginity while he wasn't a virgin himself could be seen as inconsistent. It's not necessarily illegal or morally wrong in a general sense, but it's a social or ethical judgment about fairness.\n\nSome might argue that people have the right to choose their partners based on their own preferences, even if those preferences are influenced by past behavior. However, others might say that it's unfair to judge Sofia for something he didn't hold himself to. The question is whether this makes him in the wrong.\n\nAlso, cultural and religious factors are mentioned. He's Catholic, but not very religious, and Sofia is more religious. Maybe his values have shifted over time, and he's now prioritizing her standards. But does that justify the double standard? If he's comfortable with his choices and respects Sofia's values, maybe it's not the issue. However, the hypocrisy angle is still there because he's applying different rules to himself and her.\n\nThe friend's reaction is about calling him an asshole for hypocrisy. If the author is aware of his own past and still values her virginity, that's a point of inconsistency. The answer might depend on whether the double standard is considered wrong. In many ethical frameworks, double standards are seen as problematic because they can be seen as unfair or judgmental.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions are hypocritical, which could be seen as being in the wrong. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes).\n"
