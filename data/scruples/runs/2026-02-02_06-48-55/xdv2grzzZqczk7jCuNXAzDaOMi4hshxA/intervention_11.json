Now I'll just call her Sofia. My my wife Sofia is beautiful, but most of all, she has a wonderful personality. She is reserved, incredibly kind hearted and mentally strong. She had all the qualities to make a great mother. (we're planning on trying for kids soon). She's Mexican and was born/raised there, and she is quite religious Cahtolic.\n\nNow I'm also Catholic as well, I come from an Irish American Cahtolic background. However it's more of a ''religious in name only'' sort of thing, I somewhat vaguely believe in a deity of some sorts but not really a strong belief in the scripture like my parents. \n\nAnyway, when I first started dating her, the first thing my mates said was literally ''Dude this woman is wifey material''. It became a bit of a running joke, ''wifey material''. \n\nShe seemed like the PERFECT woman and I was a bit persistant when I first met her but eventually she agreed to go on a date from me, from then on it was history because we did have a lot in common. So now we married but one of the reasons I married her, aside from her personality, was that she was a virgin. She didn't sleep around whatsoever, she held out for the ''right guy'' and that guy was me. \n\nSo when I was talking to my female friend (30F) I said that one of the reasons I wanted to marry her was because of her personality AND the fact that she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. I thought this was an okay view to hold but she called me a ''Fucking asshole'' because she pointed out that I slept around in my youth. \n\nIt's true, when I was in my early 20's, I did a lot of sleeping around and hookup culture. And I could have seen myself marrying those girls if I was left with no choice, but they were never my IDEAL choices for partners, so I feel like Sofia was a god send in that regard. My friend (20F) still said I was being a hypocrite however what right does she have to criticize my dating choices? AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for marrying someone because she didn't sleep around, given his own past of doing so.\n\nFirst, the author mentions he married Sofia because she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. His friend called him an asshole for this, pointing out his own past of sleeping around. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know if that's correct.\n\nSo, the key points here are hypocrisy and double standards. The author is judging Sofia's past (or lack thereof) based on his own standards, while not holding himself to the same. That's a classic case of hypocrisy. If someone has a history of certain behavior, holding others to a higher standard without self-reflection can be problematic. \n\nIn relationships, mutual respect is crucial. The author's decision to marry Sofia based partly on her sexual history might be seen as judgmental, especially when he had a different past. This could lead to issues in the marriage if Sofia feels she's being judged. The friend's reaction is a valid point because it highlights that the author isn't applying the same standards to himself. \n\nHowever, the author does acknowledge his own past and argues that Sofia was his ideal choice. But even if he sees it as a positive, the double standard remains. People often have different values, but when they criticize others for past behavior they themselves engaged in, it can be seen as unfair. \n\nThe situation also touches on personal values and religious beliefs. Since both are Catholic, maybe there's a cultural or religious aspect to valuing virginity. But even within religious contexts, hypocrisy can be an issue. The author's friends might be pointing out that his actions don't align with his words.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's reasons for marrying Sofia are personal, the hypocrisy in his judgment of her past compared to his own actions is a valid criticism. The key is whether he's being fair and consistent in his values. So, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
