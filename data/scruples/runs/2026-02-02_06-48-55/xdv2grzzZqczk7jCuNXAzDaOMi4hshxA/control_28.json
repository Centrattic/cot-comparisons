Now I'll just call her Sofia. My my wife Sofia is beautiful, but most of all, she has a wonderful personality. She is reserved, incredibly kind hearted and mentally strong. She had all the qualities to make a great mother. (we're planning on trying for kids soon). She's Mexican and was born/raised there, and she is quite religious Cahtolic.\n\nNow I'm also Catholic as well, I come from an Irish American Cahtolic background. However it's more of a ''religious in name only'' sort of thing, I somewhat vaguely believe in a deity of some sorts but not really a strong belief in the scripture like my parents. \n\nAnyway, when I first started dating her, the first thing my mates said was literally ''Dude this woman is wifey material''. It became a bit of a running joke, ''wifey material''. \n\nShe seemed like the PERFECT woman and I was a bit persistant when I first met her but eventually she agreed to go on a date from me, from then on it was history because we did have a lot in common. So now we married but one of the reasons I married her, aside from her personality, was that she was a virgin. She didn't sleep around whatsoever, she held out for the ''right guy'' and that guy was me. \n\nSo when I was talking to my female friend (30F) I said that one of the reasons I wanted to marry her was because of her personality AND the fact that she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. I thought this was an okay view to hold but she called me a ''Fucking asshole'' because she pointed out that I slept around in my youth. \n\nIt's true, when I was in my early 20's, I did a lot of sleeping around and hookup culture. And I could have seen myself marrying those girls if I was left with no choice, but they were never my IDEAL choices for partners, so I feel like Sofia was a god send in that regard. My friend (20F) still said I was being a hypocrite however what right does she have to criticize my dating choices? AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for his situation. The author married Sofia because she didn't sleep around, even though he himself had done so in his youth. His friend called him an asshole for being hypocritical. \n\nFirst, I need to assess if his actions are morally wrong or if he's being hypocritical. He admitted he slept around in his 20s but now values a partner who didn't. The question is whether it's wrong to value a partner's virginity, especially when he's not consistent in his own behavior.\n\nIn many cultures, valuing a partner's virginity is still common, especially in religious contexts. The author is Catholic, and Sofia is also Catholic. His background might influence his views. However, the hypocrisy comes into play because he judged her for past sexual behavior while he had similar past behavior. That could be seen as unfair or double standards.\n\nThe author's friend argues that he's a hypocrite. Hypocrisy alone doesn't necessarily mean someone is \"in the wrong,\" but it can be problematic if it leads to treating others unfairly. The key here is whether valuing a partner's virginity is okay, considering his own past. \n\nSome people might argue that it's his personal choice how he chooses his spouse, as long as both parties are okay with it. However, if he's holding her to a standard he doesn't hold himself to, that's a double standard. The problem is whether this is a valid reason for judgment or if it's just a personal preference.\n\nAlso, Sofia's feelings on the matter aren't mentioned. If she was comfortable with his reasons and didn't mind, then it's their personal choice. The issue arises when others, like his friend, criticize him for being hypocritical. But the question is whether the author is actually in the wrong, not just criticized.\n\nIn terms of ethics, hypocrisy isn't always moral wrongness. It's more about consistency. If someone's actions are inconsistent, it's a valid critique, but whether it's being \"in the wrong\" depends on the context. If he's treating Sofia unfairly or using her virginity as a requirement that's not mutual, that's an issue. But if it's just his personal preference and she's fine with it, then it's up to them. However, the act of publicly stating that a key reason for marriage is her virginity while he had a different history might be seen as judgmental towards Sofia's past choices, which could be problematic if she had any past.\n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. So, considering all that, the answer hinges on whether his hypocrisy is a moral failing. If the friend's criticism is about double standards, then he might be in the wrong for being inconsistent. However, if it's just about personal choice in a relationship, then he's not necessarily in the wrong. However, if he's applying different standards without justification, that's a problem. Since the author himself admits to past infidelity but still judged Sofia's past, that's a double standard. Therefore, he's in the wrong.\n"
