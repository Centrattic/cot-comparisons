Now I'll just call her Sofia. My my wife Sofia is beautiful, but most of all, she has a wonderful personality. She is reserved, incredibly kind hearted and mentally strong. She had all the qualities to make a great mother. (we're planning on trying for kids soon). She's Mexican and was born/raised there, and she is quite religious Cahtolic.\n\nNow I'm also Catholic as well, I come from an Irish American Cahtolic background. However it's more of a ''religious in name only'' sort of thing, I somewhat vaguely believe in a deity of some sorts but not really a strong belief in the scripture like my parents. \n\nAnyway, when I first started dating her, the first thing my mates said was literally ''Dude this woman is wifey material''. It became a bit of a running joke, ''wifey material''. \n\nShe seemed like the PERFECT woman and I was a bit persistant when I first met her but eventually she agreed to go on a date from me, from then on it was history because we did have a lot in common. So now we married but one of the reasons I married her, aside from her personality, was that she was a virgin. She didn't sleep around whatsoever, she held out for the ''right guy'' and that guy was me. \n\nSo when I was talking to my female friend (30F) I said that one of the reasons I wanted to marry her was because of her personality AND the fact that she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. I thought this was an okay view to hold but she called me a ''Fucking asshole'' because she pointed out that I slept around in my youth. \n\nIt's true, when I was in my early 20's, I did a lot of sleeping around and hookup culture. And I could have seen myself marrying those girls if I was left with no choice, but they were never my IDEAL choices for partners, so I feel like Sofia was a god send in that regard. My friend (20F) still said I was being a hypocrite however what right does she have to criticize my dating choices? AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for marrying Sofia because she didn't sleep around, while he had a history of doing so. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author married Sofia, an ideal partner in his eyes, partly because she was a virgin. He contrasts her with other women he dated in the past who he considered \"not ideal.\" His friend called him an asshole for being hypocritical since he had a history of sleeping around.\n\nNow, evaluating whether the author is in the wrong. Hypocrisy is a common angle here. If he's criticizing Sofia's past for being chaste when he himself wasn't, that's a problem. But the key point is that Sofia was a virgin and he was not. So he's not holding her to a standard he doesn't meet himself, but rather a standard she meets that he didn't. \n\nHowever, the issue might be about double standards. If he's judging her past partners (which he doesn't have, since he's married to Sofia now), but in this case, he's not judging her past. He's valuing her chastity as a positive trait. But his friend points out his own past, suggesting hypocrisy. \n\nBut hypocrisy isn't necessarily wrong. People can change their standards over time. What's important is the mutual respect in the relationship. If Sofia is okay with his past and he's okay with hers, then it's their choice. However, if he's being judgmental of others based on his own past, that's where the problem could be. \n\nIn the context of their marriage, as long as both parties are happy and the relationship is built on mutual respect and love, it's not the author's wrongdoing. The friend's criticism is about hypocrisy, but unless the author is actively harming Sofia or being disrespectful, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. \n\nSo the answer would be B (No), because the author's choice is based on his personal values and what he found in a partner. Unless he's being disrespectful to Sofia or others, his past actions don't make him wrong for valuing her chastity.\n"
