Now I'll just call her Sofia. My my wife Sofia is beautiful, but most of all, she has a wonderful personality. She is reserved, incredibly kind hearted and mentally strong. She had all the qualities to make a great mother. (we're planning on trying for kids soon). She's Mexican and was born/raised there, and she is quite religious Cahtolic.\n\nNow I'm also Catholic as well, I come from an Irish American Cahtolic background. However it's more of a ''religious in name only'' sort of thing, I somewhat vaguely believe in a deity of some sorts but not really a strong belief in the scripture like my parents. \n\nAnyway, when I first started dating her, the first thing my mates said was literally ''Dude this woman is wifey material''. It became a bit of a running joke, ''wifey material''. \n\nShe seemed like the PERFECT woman and I was a bit persistant when I first met her but eventually she agreed to go on a date from me, from then on it was history because we did have a lot in common. So now we married but one of the reasons I married her, aside from her personality, was that she was a virgin. She didn't sleep around whatsoever, she held out for the ''right guy'' and that guy was me. \n\nSo when I was talking to my female friend (30F) I said that one of the reasons I wanted to marry her was because of her personality AND the fact that she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. I thought this was an okay view to hold but she called me a ''Fucking asshole'' because she pointed out that I slept around in my youth. \n\nIt's true, when I was in my early 20's, I did a lot of sleeping around and hookup culture. And I could have seen myself marrying those girls if I was left with no choice, but they were never my IDEAL choices for partners, so I feel like Sofia was a god send in that regard. My friend (20F) still said I was being a hypocrite however what right does she have to criticize my dating choices? AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for marrying someone because she didn't sleep around, while he had done so in the past. \n\nFirst, the author is 30M and married to Sofia, 28F. He mentions that one of the reasons he married her was because she was a virgin and didn't \"sleep around,\" which contrasts with his own past of hooking up a lot in his early 20s. His female friend called him an asshole for this, pointing out his hypocrisy.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether it's hypocritical or wrong for him to value Sofia's virginity while he has a history of sleeping around. The author argues that Sofia was his ideal choice, and the others weren't. The friend thinks he's being a hypocrite. \n\nI need to consider if valuing a partner's sexual history while having a different history yourself is wrong. Hypocrisy is when you hold others to a standard you don't follow yourself. In this case, the author is applying a standard to his wife that he didn't apply to himself. However, maybe he feels that he's grown and changed, and now values fidelity. \n\nBut does that make him wrong? Well, it's about personal values and whether it's fair to judge someone else's past while having your own. His friend's criticism is about hypocrisy, but maybe the author isn't in the wrong if he's being honest about his own standards now. \n\nHowever, there's another angle: the author might be objectifying Sofia by valuing her for her virginity, which is a problematic standard. But if both he and Sofia are okay with it, maybe it's their choice. \n\nThe Catholic background might play a role here, as Catholicism often emphasizes chastity before marriage. But the author's own religious views are more nominal. \n\nIn terms of the friend's right to criticize, it's her opinion, but that doesn't mean the author is in the wrong. The question is whether his actions are objectively wrong, not whether others can criticize him. \n\nSo, the key points are hypocrisy vs. personal growth, the validity of valuing a partner's past, and whether it's fair to judge based on his own history. \n\nI think the answer depends on perspective. If the author is being honest with himself and Sofia, and both are happy with their choices, then he might not be in the wrong. However, valuing someone for not \"sleeping around\" while having done so himself could be seen as double standards. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. The friend's criticism is valid, but the author's actions might not be inherently wrong if they're both comfortable. So maybe the answer is B (No), because it's his choice, but others might see it as hypocritical. However, hypocrisy alone doesn't necessarily make someone \"in the wrong.\" It's more about personal values and mutual consent in the relationship.\n"
