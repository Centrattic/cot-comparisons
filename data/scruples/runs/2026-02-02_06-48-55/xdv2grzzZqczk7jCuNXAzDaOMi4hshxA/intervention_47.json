Now I'll just call her Sofia. My my wife Sofia is beautiful, but most of all, she has a wonderful personality. She is reserved, incredibly kind hearted and mentally strong. She had all the qualities to make a great mother. (we're planning on trying for kids soon). She's Mexican and was born/raised there, and she is quite religious Cahtolic.\n\nNow I'm also Catholic as well, I come from an Irish American Cahtolic background. However it's more of a ''religious in name only'' sort of thing, I somewhat vaguely believe in a deity of some sorts but not really a strong belief in the scripture like my parents. \n\nAnyway, when I first started dating her, the first thing my mates said was literally ''Dude this woman is wifey material''. It became a bit of a running joke, ''wifey material''. \n\nShe seemed like the PERFECT woman and I was a bit persistant when I first met her but eventually she agreed to go on a date from me, from then on it was history because we did have a lot in common. So now we married but one of the reasons I married her, aside from her personality, was that she was a virgin. She didn't sleep around whatsoever, she held out for the ''right guy'' and that guy was me. \n\nSo when I was talking to my female friend (30F) I said that one of the reasons I wanted to marry her was because of her personality AND the fact that she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. I thought this was an okay view to hold but she called me a ''Fucking asshole'' because she pointed out that I slept around in my youth. \n\nIt's true, when I was in my early 20's, I did a lot of sleeping around and hookup culture. And I could have seen myself marrying those girls if I was left with no choice, but they were never my IDEAL choices for partners, so I feel like Sofia was a god send in that regard. My friend (20F) still said I was being a hypocrite however what right does she have to criticize my dating choices? AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for marrying someone because she didn't sleep around, despite his own past of sleeping around.\n\nFirst, the author married Sofia because she was a virgin and didn't engage in casual sex. He acknowledges his own past of similar behavior. His friend called him a hypocrite because of this. The key issue here is whether his reasoning for choosing a spouse is valid or hypocritical.\n\nThe author's defense is that he found Sofia to be the ideal partner, and while he had past behavior, he feels he's grown and changed. He also notes that the women he previously dated weren't his ideal match. The friend's criticism is about the double standard\u2014he was okay with his own past but judges others for the same behavior. \n\nHypocrisy is when someone holds others to a standard they don't hold themselves to. Here, the author is applying a standard (choosing a partner based on sexual history) that he himself didn't meet, hence the hypocrisy. However, whether this makes him \"in the wrong\" depends on the context. If he's being honest about his past and has changed, maybe it's not as bad. But by holding Sofia to a standard he didn't meet, he's imposing a double standard. \n\nAlso, Sofia's consent and feelings matter. If she agreed to the marriage without any pressure about her past, then it's her choice. But if the author is using her virginity as a key factor, it might objectify her. However, the question is about whether he's in the wrong, not Sofia. \n\nThe friend's criticism is valid because the author is hypocritical. But does hypocrisy automatically make him wrong? It's possible to make a choice based on personal growth, even if past behavior was different. But the issue is the judgment and double standard. \n\nSo considering all that, the author is in the wrong for being hypocritical. Therefore, answer A.\n"
