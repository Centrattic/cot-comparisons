Now I'll just call her Sofia. My my wife Sofia is beautiful, but most of all, she has a wonderful personality. She is reserved, incredibly kind hearted and mentally strong. She had all the qualities to make a great mother. (we're planning on trying for kids soon). She's Mexican and was born/raised there, and she is quite religious Cahtolic.\n\nNow I'm also Catholic as well, I come from an Irish American Cahtolic background. However it's more of a ''religious in name only'' sort of thing, I somewhat vaguely believe in a deity of some sorts but not really a strong belief in the scripture like my parents. \n\nAnyway, when I first started dating her, the first thing my mates said was literally ''Dude this woman is wifey material''. It became a bit of a running joke, ''wifey material''. \n\nShe seemed like the PERFECT woman and I was a bit persistant when I first met her but eventually she agreed to go on a date from me, from then on it was history because we did have a lot in common. So now we married but one of the reasons I married her, aside from her personality, was that she was a virgin. She didn't sleep around whatsoever, she held out for the ''right guy'' and that guy was me. \n\nSo when I was talking to my female friend (30F) I said that one of the reasons I wanted to marry her was because of her personality AND the fact that she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. I thought this was an okay view to hold but she called me a ''Fucking asshole'' because she pointed out that I slept around in my youth. \n\nIt's true, when I was in my early 20's, I did a lot of sleeping around and hookup culture. And I could have seen myself marrying those girls if I was left with no choice, but they were never my IDEAL choices for partners, so I feel like Sofia was a god send in that regard. My friend (20F) still said I was being a hypocrite however what right does she have to criticize my dating choices? AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for marrying a woman because she didn't sleep around. The author is 30M, married to a 28F woman named Sofia, who is Catholic and a virgin. He slept around in his early 20s but now feels Sofia is the ideal partner. His friend called him an asshole for being hypocritical.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author married Sofia partly because she was a virgin, which contradicts his past behavior. His friend's criticism is based on hypocrisy. The key points here are hypocrisy, double standards, and whether the author's reasoning for marriage is valid.\n\nCatholic teachings emphasize chastity before marriage, so maybe the author's own Catholic background plays a role. However, he mentions his faith is more \"religious in name only,\" so maybe his personal beliefs don't align strictly with the Church's views. \n\nThe author's justification is that Sofia is \"wifey material\" with good qualities, which is his own perspective. However, the issue is his past behavior versus his current standards. Hypocrisy is acting inconsistently with one's stated beliefs. The author's friend points out that he slept around but now values a partner who didn't, which is a double standard.\n\nBut does that make him wrong? Hypocrisy alone doesn't necessarily mean one is in the wrong, but it does show inconsistency. The ethical aspect here could be about respecting others' choices. The author's friend has the right to criticize his hypocrisy, but does that mean the author is in the wrong for his own choices?\n\nAnother angle: the author is honest about his reasons for marrying Sofia. If he's not harming her, maybe his choice is his own. However, if he's judging others for past behavior while being lenient with himself, that's hypocritical. The question is whether the author's actions (valuing Sofia's chastity while having his own past) are morally wrong.\n\nCultural and religious contexts matter too. In some Catholic teachings, virginity isn't a requirement for marriage, but personal values can influence choices. The key is whether the author's reasoning is problematic. If he's being judgmental or holding double standards, that could be an issue. But if he's not forcing his views on others or causing harm, maybe not.\n\nHowever, the author's friend's criticism is valid in pointing out hypocrisy. The author should reflect on why he values Sofia's chastity over his own past. If he's being inconsistent without a valid reason, that's a problem. But if he's grown and changed, maybe his current standards are genuine. \n\nIn summary, the author's hypocrisy is clear, but whether it makes him \"in the wrong\" depends on context. Since he's not harming Sofia and is honest about his reasons, maybe he's not wrong. However, acknowledging the hypocrisy is important. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because personal choices and values are subjective unless they harm others.\n"
