Now I'll just call her Sofia. My my wife Sofia is beautiful, but most of all, she has a wonderful personality. She is reserved, incredibly kind hearted and mentally strong. She had all the qualities to make a great mother. (we're planning on trying for kids soon). She's Mexican and was born/raised there, and she is quite religious Cahtolic.\n\nNow I'm also Catholic as well, I come from an Irish American Cahtolic background. However it's more of a ''religious in name only'' sort of thing, I somewhat vaguely believe in a deity of some sorts but not really a strong belief in the scripture like my parents. \n\nAnyway, when I first started dating her, the first thing my mates said was literally ''Dude this woman is wifey material''. It became a bit of a running joke, ''wifey material''. \n\nShe seemed like the PERFECT woman and I was a bit persistant when I first met her but eventually she agreed to go on a date from me, from then on it was history because we did have a lot in common. So now we married but one of the reasons I married her, aside from her personality, was that she was a virgin. She didn't sleep around whatsoever, she held out for the ''right guy'' and that guy was me. \n\nSo when I was talking to my female friend (30F) I said that one of the reasons I wanted to marry her was because of her personality AND the fact that she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. I thought this was an okay view to hold but she called me a ''Fucking asshole'' because she pointed out that I slept around in my youth. \n\nIt's true, when I was in my early 20's, I did a lot of sleeping around and hookup culture. And I could have seen myself marrying those girls if I was left with no choice, but they were never my IDEAL choices for partners, so I feel like Sofia was a god send in that regard. My friend (20F) still said I was being a hypocrite however what right does she have to criticize my dating choices? AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for marrying someone because she didn't sleep around, especially since he himself had a history of sleeping around. \n\nFirst, the author married Sofia because she was a virgin and held out for the \"right guy.\" He sees her as ideal, and while his friends joke about her being \"wifey material,\" he also mentions his own past of sleeping around in his 20s. His female friend criticizes him for this, calling him an asshole.\n\nThe key points here are about hypocrisy and double standards. The author is being called out for judging Sofia's past (or lack thereof) while having his own history. The moral question is whether it's wrong to value a partner's sexual history in a way that you wouldn't hold yourself to the same standard. \n\nIn many discussions about relationships, double standards can be a problem. If the author is okay with his own past but holds Sofia to a higher standard, that's a form of hypocrisy. It's important to consider whether his reasons for valuing her virginity are based on genuine respect for her values (like her Catholic beliefs) or if it's more about his own biases or past regrets. \n\nAlso, Sofia's own values might play a role here. If she was okay with being a virgin and that aligned with her beliefs, then respecting her choices is important. But the issue arises when the author is imposing his own standards without consistency. \n\nThe friend's criticism points out that he's being inconsistent. Whether that makes him \"in the wrong\" depends on the societal or moral framework you're using. From a standpoint of equality and mutual respect, holding a double standard is problematic. However, if both partners agree and are comfortable with each other's pasts, then the relationship might be healthy regardless of external opinions.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong for the double standard, but the situation is nuanced. The answer hinges on whether his judgment of Sofia's past is fair and consistent with his own actions.\n"
