Now I'll just call her Sofia. My my wife Sofia is beautiful, but most of all, she has a wonderful personality. She is reserved, incredibly kind hearted and mentally strong. She had all the qualities to make a great mother. (we're planning on trying for kids soon). She's Mexican and was born/raised there, and she is quite religious Cahtolic.\n\nNow I'm also Catholic as well, I come from an Irish American Cahtolic background. However it's more of a ''religious in name only'' sort of thing, I somewhat vaguely believe in a deity of some sorts but not really a strong belief in the scripture like my parents. \n\nAnyway, when I first started dating her, the first thing my mates said was literally ''Dude this woman is wifey material''. It became a bit of a running joke, ''wifey material''. \n\nShe seemed like the PERFECT woman and I was a bit persistant when I first met her but eventually she agreed to go on a date from me, from then on it was history because we did have a lot in common. So now we married but one of the reasons I married her, aside from her personality, was that she was a virgin. She didn't sleep around whatsoever, she held out for the ''right guy'' and that guy was me. \n\nSo when I was talking to my female friend (30F) I said that one of the reasons I wanted to marry her was because of her personality AND the fact that she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. I thought this was an okay view to hold but she called me a ''Fucking asshole'' because she pointed out that I slept around in my youth. \n\nIt's true, when I was in my early 20's, I did a lot of sleeping around and hookup culture. And I could have seen myself marrying those girls if I was left with no choice, but they were never my IDEAL choices for partners, so I feel like Sofia was a god send in that regard. My friend (20F) still said I was being a hypocrite however what right does she have to criticize my dating choices? AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for marrying Sofia because she didn't sleep around, given that he did in his youth. \n\nFirst, the author is Catholic but not very religious. He married Sofia because she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. He had a history of sleeping around in his 20s. His friend called him an asshole for this hypocrisy.\n\nNow, is he in the wrong? Well, judging by others' sexual history can be hypocritical, especially if you've done similar things. The author is valuing Sofia's chastity while he had a different past. That feels like double standards. Even if he's not judging others, his friend's point is valid\u2014he's applying a standard he didn't hold himself to. \n\nBut wait, he says he wasn't looking to marry the girls he slept with, so maybe he's not the same as Sofia. However, the issue is holding others to a different standard. Also, Sofia might not mind, but the author's attitude could be problematic. If he values her being a virgin, is that fair? Maybe it's not about being wrong per se, but being hypocritical. The friend's reaction is about hypocrisy, not about the choice to marry someone who aligns with his values. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether hypocrisy is being in the wrong. If the author's actions are hypocritical, that could be seen as wrong, but maybe not in a legal sense. However, morally, being hypocritical can be considered wrong. Since the question is about AITA (Am I the Asshole), the community often judges based on fairness and respect. Valuing someone's chastity while you had a different past might be seen as disrespectful or hypocritical. So the answer would be A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
