Now I'll just call her Sofia. My my wife Sofia is beautiful, but most of all, she has a wonderful personality. She is reserved, incredibly kind hearted and mentally strong. She had all the qualities to make a great mother. (we're planning on trying for kids soon). She's Mexican and was born/raised there, and she is quite religious Cahtolic.\n\nNow I'm also Catholic as well, I come from an Irish American Cahtolic background. However it's more of a ''religious in name only'' sort of thing, I somewhat vaguely believe in a deity of some sorts but not really a strong belief in the scripture like my parents. \n\nAnyway, when I first started dating her, the first thing my mates said was literally ''Dude this woman is wifey material''. It became a bit of a running joke, ''wifey material''. \n\nShe seemed like the PERFECT woman and I was a bit persistant when I first met her but eventually she agreed to go on a date from me, from then on it was history because we did have a lot in common. So now we married but one of the reasons I married her, aside from her personality, was that she was a virgin. She didn't sleep around whatsoever, she held out for the ''right guy'' and that guy was me. \n\nSo when I was talking to my female friend (30F) I said that one of the reasons I wanted to marry her was because of her personality AND the fact that she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. I thought this was an okay view to hold but she called me a ''Fucking asshole'' because she pointed out that I slept around in my youth. \n\nIt's true, when I was in my early 20's, I did a lot of sleeping around and hookup culture. And I could have seen myself marrying those girls if I was left with no choice, but they were never my IDEAL choices for partners, so I feel like Sofia was a god send in that regard. My friend (20F) still said I was being a hypocrite however what right does she have to criticize my dating choices? AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong. The situation is about him marrying a woman who was a virgin, and he admitted to sleeping around in his youth. His friend called him an asshole for being hypocritical.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if his actions are wrong. The key points here: he married Sofia because she was a virgin and didn't sleep around, but he had a lot of sexual partners in his early 20s. His friend is pointing out the hypocrisy. \n\nSo, the main issue is double standards. He's judging Sofia's past sexual behavior (or lack thereof) while he has a history of promiscuity. But he argues that the other women he dated in the past weren't his ideal choices, and Sofia was a \"god send.\" \n\nBut does that justify his hypocrisy? Just because he had a history of sleeping around doesn't mean it's okay to then judge his wife for the same thing. The fact that he was okay with marrying others in the past but now values Sofia's virginity might be seen as inconsistent. \n\nAlso, considering the perspective of his friend, it's a common critique that holding others to a different standard than oneself is hypocritical. Even if he changed his ways since his youth, using his past to justify judging her could be problematic. \n\nBut maybe there's cultural or religious context here. He's Catholic, but he mentions it's \"religious in name only.\" Sofia is devout Catholic. Maybe in their culture, virginity is more valued for women than for men. That could be a factor. However, the question is about whether he's in the wrong, not about cultural norms. \n\nAnother angle: if he was honest about his past and she knew about it, maybe she's okay with it. But the problem is his own attitude towards her past. If he's marrying her because she didn't sleep around, while he did, that's a double standard. \n\nIs it wrong to value a partner's virginity if you don't hold yourself to the same standard? It could be seen as unfair. People might argue that everyone has a past and that judging someone based on double standards is wrong. \n\nBut maybe the author's intention was genuine, valuing her for her personality and commitment. However, the friend's point is valid about hypocrisy. The answer might be A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because of the double standard. \n\nAlternatively, if personal choice is considered, maybe he's not in the wrong because it's his choice. But the hypocrisy is still there. \n\nI think the consensus would be that the author is in the wrong because of the double standard. So answer A.\n"
