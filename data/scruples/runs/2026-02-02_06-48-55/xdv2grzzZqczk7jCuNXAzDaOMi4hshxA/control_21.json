Now I'll just call her Sofia. My my wife Sofia is beautiful, but most of all, she has a wonderful personality. She is reserved, incredibly kind hearted and mentally strong. She had all the qualities to make a great mother. (we're planning on trying for kids soon). She's Mexican and was born/raised there, and she is quite religious Cahtolic.\n\nNow I'm also Catholic as well, I come from an Irish American Cahtolic background. However it's more of a ''religious in name only'' sort of thing, I somewhat vaguely believe in a deity of some sorts but not really a strong belief in the scripture like my parents. \n\nAnyway, when I first started dating her, the first thing my mates said was literally ''Dude this woman is wifey material''. It became a bit of a running joke, ''wifey material''. \n\nShe seemed like the PERFECT woman and I was a bit persistant when I first met her but eventually she agreed to go on a date from me, from then on it was history because we did have a lot in common. So now we married but one of the reasons I married her, aside from her personality, was that she was a virgin. She didn't sleep around whatsoever, she held out for the ''right guy'' and that guy was me. \n\nSo when I was talking to my female friend (30F) I said that one of the reasons I wanted to marry her was because of her personality AND the fact that she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. I thought this was an okay view to hold but she called me a ''Fucking asshole'' because she pointed out that I slept around in my youth. \n\nIt's true, when I was in my early 20's, I did a lot of sleeping around and hookup culture. And I could have seen myself marrying those girls if I was left with no choice, but they were never my IDEAL choices for partners, so I feel like Sofia was a god send in that regard. My friend (20F) still said I was being a hypocrite however what right does she have to criticize my dating choices? AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a man who married a woman because she didn't sleep around, even though he himself had a history of sleeping around in his youth. His friend called him an asshole for that, leading to this AITA question.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The man married someone because she was a virgin and didn't have multiple partners, but he had done the same in his past. His friend points out the hypocrisy. The question is whether that makes him wrong.\n\nSo, the main issue here is hypocrisy. The man is judging his wife's sexual history and valuing her for being a virgin, while he himself had a different history. The friend is criticizing him for being a hypocrite. Hypocrisy is when someone holds others to a standard they themselves don't follow. In this case, the man's past behavior contradicts the standards he's applying to his wife.\n\nAnother angle is the double standard. If he's okay with his own past, why is he not okay with his wife's past? The fact that he married her partly for her virginity when he didn't maintain that standard himself could be seen as unfair or judgmental. It might also affect their relationship if he's keeping track of past behaviors in a way that's not reciprocal.\n\nHowever, some might argue that people can change over time. The man might have matured and now values a partner with similar current values, even if his past was different. But the problem arises when he's applying a different standard to his wife than he allows for himself. That's the crux of the hypocrisy.\n\nAlso, the fact that he's vocalizing this to his friend and justifying it as his reason for marriage could be what's causing the friend's reaction. The friend's point is that if he had a history of multiple partners, he's being inconsistent by not extending the same leniency to his wife.\n\nIn terms of ethical considerations, it's about treating others with respect and not holding double standards. If he's okay with his past, he should be okay with his wife's past as well, assuming their current relationship is healthy and consensual. The issue here is not just about his past but how he's applying those standards to his wife.\n\nAdditionally, the religious aspect might play a role. If both are Catholic, maybe there are teachings about forgiveness and not judging others. But the man's personal beliefs are more secular in religion, so that might not be a strong factor here.\n\nIn conclusion, the man is being hypocritical by applying a standard to his wife that he didn't hold himself to. His friend is pointing out the inconsistency, which is a valid criticism. Therefore, the answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
