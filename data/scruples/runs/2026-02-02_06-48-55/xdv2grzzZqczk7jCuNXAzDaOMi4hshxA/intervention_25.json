Now I'll just call her Sofia. My my wife Sofia is beautiful, but most of all, she has a wonderful personality. She is reserved, incredibly kind hearted and mentally strong. She had all the qualities to make a great mother. (we're planning on trying for kids soon). She's Mexican and was born/raised there, and she is quite religious Cahtolic.\n\nNow I'm also Catholic as well, I come from an Irish American Cahtolic background. However it's more of a ''religious in name only'' sort of thing, I somewhat vaguely believe in a deity of some sorts but not really a strong belief in the scripture like my parents. \n\nAnyway, when I first started dating her, the first thing my mates said was literally ''Dude this woman is wifey material''. It became a bit of a running joke, ''wifey material''. \n\nShe seemed like the PERFECT woman and I was a bit persistant when I first met her but eventually she agreed to go on a date from me, from then on it was history because we did have a lot in common. So now we married but one of the reasons I married her, aside from her personality, was that she was a virgin. She didn't sleep around whatsoever, she held out for the ''right guy'' and that guy was me. \n\nSo when I was talking to my female friend (30F) I said that one of the reasons I wanted to marry her was because of her personality AND the fact that she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. I thought this was an okay view to hold but she called me a ''Fucking asshole'' because she pointed out that I slept around in my youth. \n\nIt's true, when I was in my early 20's, I did a lot of sleeping around and hookup culture. And I could have seen myself marrying those girls if I was left with no choice, but they were never my IDEAL choices for partners, so I feel like Sofia was a god send in that regard. My friend (20F) still said I was being a hypocrite however what right does she have to criticize my dating choices? AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author marrying a woman because she didn't sleep around, despite his own past of doing so. The friend called him an asshole for this, and he's asking if he's the asshole (AITA).\n\nSo, the author is a 30-year-old man who married Sofia, a 28-year-old woman he considers perfect. He mentions that one of the reasons he married her was that she was a virgin and didn't \"sleep around.\" However, he admits he had a history of sleeping around in his early 20s. His friend criticizes him as a hypocrite for valuing Sofia's purity while having his own past. The author is defending himself by saying that the girls he might have married otherwise weren't his ideal choices, and Sofia was a \"godsend.\"\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the ethical implications here. The key points are double standards. The author is holding Sofia to a standard (virginity) that he himself didn't meet in the past. This could be seen as hypocritical. Even if his past behavior was before he met Sofia, the fact that he's now valuing her purity while not applying the same to himself might be problematic.\n\nReligious context: Both are Catholic, but the author isn't strictly religious. Sofia, being Mexican Catholic, might have held out for marriage due cultural or religious reasons. The author might not have considered the potential double standard here, especially since he's not strictly following religious practices himself.\n\nHypocrisy aspect: The friend points out the hypocrisy. The author is criticizing Sofia's past (or lack thereof) while his own past is similar. Even if he's changed, the fact that he's holding her to a higher standard could be seen as unfair. It might also imply that he's not treating her as an equal in terms of expectations.\n\nIntentions matter. The author states that he married her for her personality and other qualities, but the virginity was a factor. If he's being honest about his motivations, then there's a question about whether that's respectful. Valuing someone's purity while having a different past could be seen as objectifying or placing unrealistic expectations on her.\n\nHowever, the author argues that he's changed and that the other potential partners weren't ideal. But that doesn't negate the hypocrisy in the friend's point. The right to criticize from the friend is debatable, but the main issue is whether the author is wrong in his perspective.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, double standards in relationships are often frowned upon. If the author is judging Sofia for not acting in a way he himself didn't, it's a valid critique. So, the author might be in the wrong for that double standard.\n\nBut maybe there's a cultural or personal reason. The author might not have realized the hypocrisy himself. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. If we go strictly by the actions and not considering mitigating factors like cultural background, the double standard is there.\n\nTherefore, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong (A) because he's applying a double standard by valuing Sofia's purity while ignoring his own past behavior.\n"
