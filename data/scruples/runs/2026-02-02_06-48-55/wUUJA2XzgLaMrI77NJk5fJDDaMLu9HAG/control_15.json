We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop fan behavior. So first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe author, a guy, is 18 and in a serious relationship for over a month. His girlfriend is also 18. She's really into K-Pop, specifically Jung Yong Hwa. He says he tries to be understanding, even though he doesn't care for K-Pop. She's been fangirling a lot, which he finds a bit bothersome but tolerates. But when she says she would go to the concert in Korea even if he were in the hospital, that's the breaking point. He breaks up with her, calling her a psycho. Now he's asking if he's the asshole.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, consent and respect in relationships are key. The girlfriend's behavior\u2014liking every post, saving for a tattoo, and expressing that she would attend the concert even if the author was in the hospital\u2014might be seen as extreme. But is that grounds for breaking up? \n\nThe author mentions that he was okay with the tattoo and other things. The last straw was her hypothetical commitment to the concert despite his hypothetical illness. That seems like a test of loyalty, maybe. The girlfriend's response was not what he wanted, so he ended things. \n\nBut is it fair to break up over a hypothetical scenario? The scenario was a hypothetical situation, not a real one. She was responding to a \"what if\" that wasn't real. Her answer was honest, but maybe she didn't mean it. However, the author took it as a sign that she wouldn't prioritize him in a real emergency. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's fandom is intense but not inherently wrong. Fandoms can be a significant part of someone's life. But if it's causing a conflict in the relationship, communication is important. The author tried to play along with the hypothetical, but her answer hurt him. \n\nHowever, the author's reaction was immediate and harsh. He called her a psycho and ended the relationship. That's a strong reaction. Maybe there was a lack of communication beforehand. If he had concerns about her fandom's impact on their relationship, he should have addressed them earlier. Ending the relationship based on a hypothetical scenario might be seen as overreacting. \n\nBut on the flip side, if he felt that her answer indicated a lack of commitment to the relationship in a crisis, he might have valid reasons. However, the hypothetical nature of the question is a problem. People might not act the same in real situations as they do in hypotheticals. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he didn't communicate his feelings about her fandom before, and then acted on a hypothetical, he might be. But if he felt that her answer showed she wouldn't prioritize him in a real emergency, maybe not. \n\nAnother angle: the duration of the relationship. They've been dating for a month. Maybe it's still early days, and this is a big reaction based on a single issue. However, if this is a pattern, it's more significant. \n\nThe key points are: \n\n1. The author tried to be understanding of her fandom.\n2. The breaking point was a hypothetical scenario.\n3. His reaction was immediate and harsh.\n4. The girlfriend's response was honest but perhaps not considered deeply.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If he felt that her fandom was becoming a problem, he should have discussed it. Ending it suddenly because of a hypothetical might not be fair. However, if he felt it revealed a lack of loyalty, he might have his reasons. \n\nBut given that the scenario was hypothetical and she didn't lie, maybe the author overreacted. The fact that he called her a psycho is a strong accusation and might be seen as dismissive of her feelings. \n\nI think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because he broke up over a hypothetical, didn't communicate his feelings earlier, and reacted overly harshly. However, others might argue B because he felt disrespected. But in the context, A is more likely the correct answer here.\n"
