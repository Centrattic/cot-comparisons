We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop obsession is in the wrong. The situation is that the girlfriend is really into Jung Yong Hwa, a K-Pop artist. The guy says he's okay with her liking him, even the tattoo, but when she said she would go to a concert in Korea even if he was in the hospital, he broke up with her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girl's level of fandom is intense, but the guy had been tolerating it up until that point. The breaking point was her statement about attending the concert despite his serious illness. The question is whether he's in the wrong for ending the relationship over that.\n\nI should think about the dynamics of their relationship. He mentions that she's not very complimentary towards him, only occasionally. Her fangirling over someone she's never met, liking all his posts, saving for a tattoo, and even willing to go to a concert despite a partner's hospitalization. The guy felt heartbroken and called her a psycho.\n\nIn terms of expectations, in a serious relationship, mutual respect and consideration are important. If one partner's commitment to a fan interest is seen as prioritizing a celebrity over the partner's well-being, that could be a red flag. However, it's also possible that the guy's reaction was too harsh. Breaking up over a hypothetical scenario might be extreme, especially if it's the first time such a comment was made.\n\nBut wait, the guy had been accepting of her K-Pop love until this point. The specific response to his hypothetical question might have triggered him because it indicated a lack of loyalty or consideration in her extreme fandom. On the other hand, maybe he should have communicated his feelings earlier instead of reacting so strongly later.\n\nAnother angle: The girl's answer was honest, but was it the wrong answer? If she was truthful, maybe the guy is overreacting. However, the willingness to leave a partner for a celebrity could be a deal-breaker. It's a matter of where the line is drawn in terms of relationship values.\n\nI should also consider cultural aspects. K-Pop fandoms can be very passionate, and maybe her behavior is within normal bounds for that community. But when it affects the relationship's balance, it's a personal issue. The guy's reaction is his way of handling it, but is it justified?\n\nIn summary, the guy's decision to break up was based on her hypothetical response, which he found unacceptable. Whether he's in the wrong depends on whether his reaction was proportionate. If he had been building up frustration over her behavior and this was the tipping point, it's a valid reason. However, ending a month-long relationship over one hypothetical scenario might be seen as impulsive. But given that he had tolerated the other behaviors, maybe not. So, the answer could be B (he's not in the wrong) because he had a right to feel betrayed if her response indicated that her loyalty to the celebrity overrode her commitment to him.\n"
