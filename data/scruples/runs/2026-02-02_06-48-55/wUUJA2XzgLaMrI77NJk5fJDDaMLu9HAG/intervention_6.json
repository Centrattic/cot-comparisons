We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about breaking up with a girlfriend over her K-Pop obsession, specifically with Jung Yong Hwa.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girlfriend has been fangirling over this artist, likes him a lot, and even wants a tattoo. The author was okay with all that until the conversation about the concert. When the author asked hypothetically if she would still go to the concert even if he was in the hospital, she said she wouldn't lie and would go. The author then called her a psycho and broke up.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, the question is whether breaking up over this is justified. The author says they were okay with her fangirling before. The issue here is the hypothetical scenario and her response. The author might feel that her answer showed she wasn't committed to the relationship. But is that a valid reason to break up?\n\nOn one hand, the girlfriend's response could be seen as dismissive of the author's feelings, suggesting that her commitment to the idol outweighs her commitment to the relationship. On the other hand, the author's reaction was immediate and severe\u2014calling her a psycho and ending things. Maybe the author didn't communicate his feelings properly before the hypothetical question. Also, the scenario is hypothetical, so maybe it's not a real situation, but the response triggered him.\n\nBut is breaking up over a hypothetical scenario fair? The girlfriend's reaction might indicate that she values her K-Pop idol more than the relationship, but is that a deal-breaker? The author could have discussed his concerns more calmly. By reacting impulsively, he might be overreacting. However, if this was a recurring issue and the author felt that her commitment wasn't there, maybe it's a valid reason. But since it's a new relationship (over a month), maybe the author is being too quick to judge. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend didn't lie and was honest, which could be seen as being truthful, but that doesn't mean her answer was wrong. The author might have expected her to prioritize the relationship, but if that's not the case, then the breakup could be justified. But the way he handled it (calling her a psycho) might be harsh. \n\nSo, considering all this, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because he had the right to end the relationship if he felt his needs weren't met. However, his method was abrupt. But the question is about being in the wrong, not the method. If her answer was a deal-breaker for him, then he's not in the wrong. But if the issue was her K-Pop fandom, which he was okay with before, then maybe he's overreacting. The key is whether her answer was a genuine deal-breaker. If he couldn't handle that hypothetical scenario, then maybe it's a valid reason. So I'm leaning towards B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he had the right to end the relationship if her answer was unacceptable. However, some might argue he should have addressed it earlier or in a different way.\n"
