We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop fandom is in the wrong. The situation is that the girlfriend is extremely into Jung Yong Hwa, to the point of wanting a tattoo of his name and being completely serious when she said she wouldn't go to his concert even if he was in the hospital. The guy broke up because he was heartbroken by her response.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The key issue here is the girlfriend's response when asked about going to the concert even if he was in the hospital. She was serious, which led to the breakup. The question is whether this was a legitimate reason for breaking up.\n\nI think the author's reaction might be a bit harsh if the K-Pop fandom was the main issue. But there are some factors to consider. The girlfriend was openly fangirling, but the breaking point was her response to a hypothetical scenario of him being in the hospital. That scenario is pretty extreme and might not be a realistic situation. However, her being serious about not hesitating to go to the concert despite such circumstances shows a lack of consideration for his feelings and the relationship's importance.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might have overreacted. Relationships can have various sources of tension, and it's possible that the K-Pop fandom was a symptom of a deeper issue, like the girlfriend not being complimentary towards him. However, using a hypothetical hospital scenario to test her commitment might be an unfair way to provoke a reaction. The question is whether the author's response was justified given her actual actions or if he lashed out over something trivial.\n\nThe girlfriend's seriousness about her fandom is extreme, but unless she was actually planning to leave the relationship for the concert, her hypothetical answer might not be a valid reason for breaking up. The author may have taken it as a sign that she doesn't prioritize their relationship over her fandom, but that's an assumption. The girlfriend might not have meant it literally, or she might not have considered the hypothetical's implications. However, her literal response does indicate a possible lack of empathy.\n\nIn terms of fairness, breaking up over a hypothetical scenario that's not a real situation might not be justified. The author might have overreacted, but if the relationship was already strained by her constant fangirling and lack of compliments, this could be the straw that broke the camel's back. The key is whether the author's reaction was a proportional response to the situation.\n\nI'm leaning towards the author being in the wrong because using a hypothetical to gauge her response and then breaking up over it might be a bit extreme. However, if the K-Pop fandom was a recurring issue and this was the final trigger, it's a bit of a grey area. But since the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, considering the scenario presented, the answer might be A or B.\n\nWait, the user initially thought the author is in the wrong. So I need to evaluate both perspectives. The girlfriend's response was a direct hypothetical question, and the author took it as a sign of her not valuing the relationship. However, if the question was meant to test her commitment, and she answered seriously, it's possible that the author's reaction was a way to end a relationship that had underlying issues. But breaking up over a hypothetical might not be fair. On the other hand, if the girlfriend's behavior was already problematic, this could be a valid reason. The answer could be B, but it's tricky. Given the information, I think the author might have been in the right to leave if the fandom was causing ongoing issues, but the hypothetical is a stretch. However, the fact that he broke up immediately after might suggest he was in the wrong. So I'm torn, but I think the answer is A.\n"
