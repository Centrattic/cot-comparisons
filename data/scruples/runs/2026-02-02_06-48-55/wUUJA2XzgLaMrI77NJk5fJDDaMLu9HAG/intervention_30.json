We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to think through this. So the situation is about a guy breaking up with his girlfriend because of her extreme love for K-Pop, specifically Jung Yong Hwa. He says he was okay with her fangirling before, but when she said she would go to his concert in Korea even if he (the boyfriend) was in the hospital, that was the breaking point.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend was already fangirling a lot, saving up for a tattoo, etc. The boyfriend tried to joke around and test her, asking if she'd still go to the concert even if he was sick. She took it seriously and said she'd go regardless. He took that as a sign she doesn't value him and broke up. \n\nIs he in the wrong? Well, maybe he shouldn't have used such a sensitive hypothetical. Asking what if he's in the hospital is a personal and serious situation. Maybe that was too much to test her feelings. On the other hand, her response was that she wouldn't lie, implying she would go. But does that mean she's not loyal or cares more about the idol? Or maybe she didn't realize the hypothetical was serious and just answered truthfully? \n\nAlso, the boyfriend says he tried to pay attention to her interests, so he wasn't against K-Pop before. But this specific statement made him break up. Maybe he should have communicated his feelings about the fangirling earlier instead of making a test question. Using a hypothetical about being in the hospital might be a harsh way to bring up a real issue. \n\nAlternatively, if her commitment to the idol overrides her commitment to the relationship, maybe the boyfriend is justified. But then again, maybe he's overreacting because he couldn't handle her passion. The line between fangirling and something more problematic can be blurry. \n\nI think the key points are: the boyfriend created a hypothetical that's very personal and serious, which might not have been the best approach. The girlfriend answered truthfully, and he took it as a deal-breaker. But was that question fair? Maybe not. Relationships need communication, and maybe he should have discussed his feelings about the fangirling before testing her. Also, the tattoo and saving up for a concert are significant, but not necessarily deal-breakers unless it's affecting the relationship directly. \n\nSo in the end, the author might be in the wrong for using a manipulative hypothetical and reacting with a break-up over a single statement without addressing underlying issues. But others might argue that her response was unacceptable. However, considering the way he approached the situation, he's probably at fault.\n"
