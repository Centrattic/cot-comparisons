We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because of her extreme love for K-Pop, specifically Jung Yong Hwa. The situation is that she's a huge fan, fangirling a lot, liking all his posts on Instagram, and even planning to get a tattoo of his name. The breaking point was when he asked her if she'd still go to his concert in Korea even if he were in the hospital, and she said she wouldn't lie, implying she wouldn't go. He then called her a psycho and broke up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationship. They've been dating seriously for over a month. The author mentions that he's okay with her K-Pop fandom, even the tattoo. The key issue here is her response to the hypothetical scenario. The author's question was a test of her commitment, maybe to see if she'd prioritize him over her fandom. Her answer suggested she wouldn't go if he was in the hospital, which he took as a sign that her devotion to the idol was more important than her relationship with him. That led him to feel heartbroken and end things.\n\nNow, is he in the wrong? Well, breaking up is a personal decision, but maybe the way he reacted was harsh. She didn't lie; she was honest. Her fandom might be intense, but she's not met the idol, just a fan. The tattoo and attending the concert are expressions of her admiration, but the author's reaction was immediate and strong. However, if her answer truly made him feel that his well-being wasn't her priority, that's a valid concern. Even though it's a hypothetical, her response might indicate a lack of consideration for the relationship. On the other hand, maybe he overreacted. It's possible that the situation revealed a fundamental incompatibility in their values. The author might have felt that her commitment wasn't on the same level as his, leading to the breakup. Whether he's the asshole depends on if her answer was a deal-breaker and if he handled it appropriately. Since he's in the \"What to Do\" forum, people might argue both sides. Some could say he's being too sensitive, others that her answer was a red flag. But ultimately, if he can't handle her fandom to that extent, maybe it's not his fault. However, the way he called her a psycho might be seen as harsh. So, there's a mix here. I think the answer is B, No, he's not in the wrong because her answer was a deal-breaker for him, but some might say he should have communicated better first. But since he broke up after she confirmed her answer, and he's stating his feelings, it's his right to leave if that's something he can't reconcile.\n"
