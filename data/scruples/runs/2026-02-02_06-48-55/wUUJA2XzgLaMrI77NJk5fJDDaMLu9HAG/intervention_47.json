We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop obsession, specifically her reaction to the hypothetical scenario about him being in the hospital.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend is a huge fan of Jung Yong Hwa, to the point of saving for a tattoo and wanting to go to a concert in Korea. The author is okay with that, but the breaking point was when she said she would still go to the concert even if he was in the hospital. The author found this heartless and ended the relationship.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the key here is whether her response was reasonable and if the author overreacted. The girlfriend didn't lie when asked if she would go regardless of his health. She gave a truthful answer, which might have been hurtful, but was it a dealbreaker? \n\nThe author's reaction was immediate and harsh. He called her a psycho and cut things off. While her behavior might be extreme, it's up to the individual to decide what they can tolerate. However, relationships require communication and mutual respect. The author might have felt disrespected, but ending the relationship so quickly without discussion could be seen as impulsive. \n\nOn the other hand, if her infatuation with a celebrity was already a source of discomfort and she didn't see it as a problem, the author might have every right to end the relationship. It's about compatibility and whether the issues are dealbreakers for both parties. Since the author was the one who initiated the breakup and felt the need to justify it, it's possible he was in the right to leave, but the way he reacted (calling her a psycho) might not be the healthiest approach. \n\nBalancing these points, the author's decision to end the relationship might be justified, but his response could be seen as harsh. However, the core issue is her prioritization of a celebrity over their relationship in a hypothetical. That's a significant red flag. So, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong, but there are nuances.\n"
