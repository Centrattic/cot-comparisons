We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop obsession. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has been dating seriously for over a month. The girlfriend is really into K-Pop, specifically Jung Yong Hwa. The author mentions that he's tried to pay attention but doesn't care for K-Pop. He's okay with her fangirling, even the tattoo. But the breaking point was when she said she would go to the concert in Korea even if he were in the hospital. The author reacted strongly, called her a psycho, and broke up. Now he's asking if he's the asshole.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's reaction to her commitment to attending the concert despite a hypothetical serious situation involving him. The girlfriend was completely serious in her answer, which upset him. He didn't expect her to lie, but her answer led him to break up. \n\nI need to consider if his reaction was justified. Breaking up over this seems extreme. The girlfriend's statement was hypothetical, but the author took it as a sign that she doesn't prioritize the relationship. However, maybe she was just being honest, and he overreacted. But then again, if this is a dealbreaker for him, maybe it's valid. \n\nBut wait, the girlfriend's answer was a hypothetical scenario. Maybe she was testing his hypothetical question, and her answer was just a way to show how much she cares about her K-Pop idol, not necessarily that she would abandon him in real life. But the author took it as a sign that her commitment to the idol outweighs her commitment to him. However, since it's a hypothetical, maybe it's not the best basis to end a relationship. \n\nAlso, the author called her a psycho and ended the relationship immediately. That seems harsh. The girlfriend's actions up until that point were not something he found unacceptable until that moment. The tattoo and fangirling were okay. The breaking point was her hypothetical answer. So maybe the author overreacted. \n\nBut then, if the author felt that her devotion to the idol would override her commitment to him in a real crisis, breaking up might be his choice. However, using a hypothetical scenario to make such a decision could be seen as impulsive. The girlfriend might not have meant it that way. \n\nIn terms of relationship issues, communication is key. Maybe the author should have discussed his feelings and concerns instead of reacting so strongly. Ending a relationship over a hypothetical scenario might not be fair, especially since the girlfriend's actions up to that point were acceptable. The author's reaction was immediate and harsh, which could indicate he was acting on his own insecurities rather than a genuine issue with her. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong for overreacting and breaking up over a hypothetical situation without giving her a chance to explain or clarify. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). But I'm a bit torn because maybe he felt deeply hurt. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. The community might see the immediate breakup as too quick without understanding her perspective.\n"
