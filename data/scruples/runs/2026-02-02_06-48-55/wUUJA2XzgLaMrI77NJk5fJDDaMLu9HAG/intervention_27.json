We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong after breaking up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop obsession.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has been dating for over a month. The guy doesn't like K-Pop but tries to be supportive. The girlfriend is a huge fan of Jung Yong Hwa, to the point of fangirling, saving for a tattoo, and liking every Instagram post. The breaking point was when she said she wouldn't go to his concert even if he (the boyfriend) was in the hospital. The guy took that as a dealbreaker and broke up with her.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. But I need to evaluate both sides. \n\nThe girlfriend's actions: She's deeply into K-Pop, which is her personal choice. The guy says he's okay with most of it, including the tattoo. The issue is her response to the hypothetical scenario. She didn't lie and said she wouldn't go. But is that a valid reason to break up? \n\nThe guy's reaction: He called her a psycho and ended the relationship. That's pretty harsh. But maybe he felt disrespected or that she didn't value their relationship. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, communication is key. The guy might have felt that her priorities were misplaced. However, breaking up over a hypothetical scenario could be seen as overreacting, especially if he didn't address his concerns sooner. \n\nThe girlfriend's response, while maybe hurtful, might not be as wrong as the guy's immediate reaction. Ending a relationship over a single hypothetical question, especially in a month-long relationship, could be too extreme. But it's his right to decide if he can't handle it. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's subjective. However, the key point is whether he was justified. The girlfriend's answer was honest, but the guy's reaction was abrupt. The fact that he didn't give her a chance to explain or reconcile immediately might make him the asshole. \n\nAlso, considering the time frame of the relationship, a month is short. If this was a dealbreaker, maybe it's better to end it than stay. But his harsh words (\"call her a psycho\") might tip the balance. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because he reacted too harshly and didn't give her a chance to discuss. But I'm a bit conflicted. The girl's answer was problematic, but his response was also extreme. Maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because he had the right to end the relationship if her priorities were a dealbreaker. Hmm. Need to decide which side weighs more.\n"
