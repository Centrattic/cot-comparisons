We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the situation is about a guy breaking up with his girlfriend because of her extreme love for K-Pop, specifically Jung Yong Hwa. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The guy says he's okay with her fangirling before, even the tattoo. But when she says she would go to the concert in Korea even if he was in the hospital, he breaks up with her. He's arguing that her answer was a deal-breaker. \n\nI should consider what's reasonable. People have different levels of tolerance for their partner's interests. K-Pop is a big thing, and some people are super fans. The girl's behavior seems intense, but maybe that's normal for her. The key point here is her response to the hypothetical scenario where he's in the hospital. If she's willing to leave him in the hospital, that's a big red flag for the guy. It suggests she values her idol over her partner in a crisis. \n\nBut is the guy overreacting? Maybe. If she's been fangirling all along and he's been okay with it until this point, maybe this is a test of where the line is. But if he's never confronted her about her obsession before, breaking up only after this incident might seem sudden. However, the hypothetical scenario is extreme. How someone answers a hypothetical situation might not reflect real-life actions, but it can still be a deal-breaker for someone. \n\nThe guy's reaction was to call her a psycho and break up. That's a strong reaction. But if that's his breaking point, maybe he's justified in feeling that her loyalty is misplaced. On the other hand, maybe he should have addressed it earlier if it was a concern. Since he didn't mention other issues, maybe this was his main issue. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If he had communicated earlier about his concerns about her obsession, maybe. But since he only broke up because of her answer to the hypothetical, it's more about his own boundaries. People have different deal-breakers. If he can't handle that level of commitment to an idol over a partner, he's not wrong to break up. But others might say he's being too harsh. \n\nBut in the context of a one-month relationship, maybe there's not enough time to fully understand each other's values. However, the scenario is about loyalty in a crisis, which is a significant issue. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether the guy's reaction is reasonable. Since he's stating that her answer was the final straw and he's heartbroken, it's his right to end the relationship. So the answer would be B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
