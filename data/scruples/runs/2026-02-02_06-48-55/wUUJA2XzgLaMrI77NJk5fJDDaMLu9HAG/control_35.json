We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the guy who broke up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop obsession) is in the wrong. The situation is about his girlfriend's intense fangirling of Jung Yong Hwa, which he's okay with up until her response to a hypothetical scenario.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The guy mentions that he's tried to be patient with her fangirling, even going as far as being okay with her getting a tattoo of the artist's name. The breaking point was when she said she wouldn't miss the concert even if he were in the hospital. He found this response heart-wrenching and decided to end the relationship.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong (A) or not (B). On one hand, everyone has their limits in a relationship. If her response made him feel unimportant or that her commitment to a celebrity outweighs her loyalty to him, that's a valid emotional trigger. Communication issues might play a role here. Maybe he hadn't expressed how her fangirling affected him before, leading to a sudden reaction. Breaking up because of such a specific issue could seem harsh, but if it's a deal-breaker for him, it's his choice.\n\nOn the other hand, her actions\u2014like fanning over a celebrity, saving for a tattoo, etc.\u2014are within her personal rights unless they directly harm their relationship. Her response to the hypothetical scenario might have been insensitive, but it's a hypothetical. The question is whether his reaction was disproportionate. Ending a month-long relationship over this might be seen as impulsive, especially if there were no prior discussions about boundaries around her fandom. \n\nHowever, the key point is mutual respect and communication. If he never addressed his feelings about her obsession before and only did so in this scenario, maybe he's at fault for not communicating earlier. Alternatively, if her response truly crossed a line he couldn't accept, then his decision is understandable. \n\nBut given that the scenario is hypothetical and not an actual event, her answer being so absolute might have been a red flag he needed to address. However, breaking up immediately after might be seen as hasty. The user is asking if he's the asshole. The community's general take on such situations often leans towards valuing communication and not making snap decisions. But personal boundaries are also important. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer might be B (he's not in the wrong) because personal boundaries matter, and if her hypothetical answer was a deal-breaker for him, acting on it is his right. However, some might argue that he should have discussed this issue before reacting so strongly. The balance here is tricky. But given that the scenario is a hypothetical and not a real conflict, his reaction might be over the top. Still, his emotional response is valid. I think the answer is B.\n"
