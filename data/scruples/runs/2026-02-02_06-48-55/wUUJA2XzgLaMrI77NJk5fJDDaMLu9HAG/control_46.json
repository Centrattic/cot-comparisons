We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who broke up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop fandom is in the wrong. The situation is that the guy is 18, they've been dating seriously for over a month. The girl is really into Jung Yong Hwa, a K-Pop artist. He's not into K-Pop but tries to listen. She's very fangirling over him, which he finds a bit bothersome but tries to understand. She likes all his posts, saves up for a tattoo of his name. Then, when he asks if she'd still go to the concert even if he was in the hospital, she says she'd go, which breaks his heart and leads him to break up.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if he was wrong to break up. The key points here are about boundaries, communication, and expectations in a relationship. The guy's issue is with her level of commitment to her fandom compared to their relationship. When he posed the hypothetical scenario, her response indicated that her loyalty to the fandom might override her commitment to him. That's a big deal because relationships require mutual respect and consideration for each other's needs and feelings.\n\nHe says he's okay with the tattoo and her saving up for the concert. But the critical moment was when he asked about going to the concert if he were in the hospital. Her answer of \"Do you expect me to lie?\" implies that she would prioritize her fandom over his well-being. That's a red flag for him, and he felt heartbroken. Breaking up because of this could be seen as a valid decision if he felt disrespected or unimportant in her life.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe he overreacted. Fangirling is a common behavior and not inherently wrong. However, when it comes to hypothetical scenarios where the partner's health is compromised, the response might indicate a lack of empathy or consideration. The question is whether her response was genuinely a deal-breaker for him. \n\nIn relationships, it's important that both partners feel valued. If one partner feels that their partner's commitment is more to a celebrity than to them, especially in a hypothetical that's emotionally charged, it's reasonable for them to seek a partner who would prioritize them in such situations. \n\nSo, considering all that, the guy's decision to break up might not be the wrong one. He expressed his feelings and boundaries, and when tested, her response didn't meet his expectations. Therefore, the answer might be B (he's not in the wrong).\n"
