We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop idol obsession. The key points here are the context of their relationship, the specific incident that led to the breakup, and the broader implications.\n\nFirst, the couple has been dating seriously for over a month. The girl is a huge fan of Jung Yong Hwa, to the point of fangirling extensively, saving for a tattoo, and being overly complimentary about him. The author mentions he's tried to be understanding but is bothered by her constant fawning. The breaking point was when she said she wouldn't go to the concert even if he were in the hospital. Her response was that she wouldn't lie, meaning she'd go regardless.\n\nNow, considering relationship dynamics, it's important that both partners feel valued and respected. The author's reaction was immediate and severe\u2014he called her a psycho and broke up. While it's valid to feel hurt or neglected, reacting so strongly to a hypothetical scenario might be seen as overreacting. However, her response indicated that her priorities might not align with his well-being, which is a red flag. \n\nThe key question is whether the author's reaction was disproportionate. Breaking up over a hypothetical situation might be harsh, but if this was a culmination of ongoing tensions, it's a way to set a boundary. On the other hand, if the author didn't address these feelings earlier, he might be in the wrong for not communicating his issues before ending things. However, the situation presented here is that the final straw was her response to a hypothetical, which he found unacceptable. Given that, his decision to end the relationship could be seen as a necessary boundary rather than being in the wrong. So, the answer would lean towards B (Not in the wrong).\n"
