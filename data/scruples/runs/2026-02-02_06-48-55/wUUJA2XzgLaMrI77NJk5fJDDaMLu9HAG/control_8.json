We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop fandom, specifically her devotion to Jung Yong Hwa. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The couple has been dating for over a month. The guy isn't into K-Pop but tries to be supportive. The girl is super enthusiastic about her idol, even going as far as getting a tattoo of his name. The breaking point was when he asked if she'd still go to the concert if he was in the hospital, and she said yes. He took that as a deal-breaker and broke up.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's the asshole here. Let's break it down. Relationships require mutual respect and understanding. If her K-Pop obsession was something he could tolerate until this specific situation, then maybe his reaction was a response to a deeper issue. The scenario where he's in the hospital and she's still going to the concert might have made him feel unimportant or not a priority in her life. \n\nBut wait, she's a teenager, and maybe her fandom is just a phase. The fact that she's saving for a tattoo and going to a concert in Korea shows a lot of commitment, but does that make her a \"psycho\"? The author's reaction of calling her a psycho and breaking up might be seen as overreacting, especially given their relationship's short duration. \n\nHowever, if he felt that her devotion was overshadowing their relationship and she wasn't considering his feelings in that hypothetical situation, then his decision might be justified. The key is whether her answer was a deal-breaker for him. Since he couldn't accept her answer, maybe he wasn't the right partner for her. \n\nBut in terms of being in the wrong, the question is about his actions. If he couldn't handle her interests and felt the need to end the relationship because of them, maybe he's not the asshole. Relationships are about compatibility. If her priorities were conflicting with his, and he chose to leave, that's his decision. However, the way he reacted\u2014calling her a psycho\u2014might be harsh, but the breakup itself could be justified if he felt she wasn't prioritizing him in a critical situation.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe her answer wasn't as big of a deal as he thought. The hypothetical scenario is extreme, and her response might not reflect real-life behavior. Also, considering the short time they've been dating, maybe he was being too quick to judge. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's decision to break up might be based on incompatible values or priorities. If he couldn't accept her devotion to her idol over his well-being, then he's not in the wrong for ending it. However, the way he handled it could be seen as harsh. But since the question is about being in the wrong, not the manner of the breakup, the answer might lean towards B (No), he's not in the wrong because he's choosing to leave a relationship where his needs aren't met.\n"
