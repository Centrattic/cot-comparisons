We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop obsession. So, the situation is that the author and his girlfriend have been dating for over a month. The girlfriend is really into K-Pop, specifically Jung Yong Hwa. The author says he doesn't care for K-Pop but tries to listen. The main issue is when the author asks what if he was in the hospital, and she says she would still go to the concert, which upsets him so much he breaks up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider relationship boundaries. The author had been okay with her fangirling and even the tattoo. The breaking point was her response about going to the concert even if he was in the hospital. The question is whether that's a reasonable reason to break up. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, communication and mutual respect are key. The author felt that her answer showed a lack of commitment in a serious situation. However, she might see her fandom as a personal passion and not necessarily a priority over all else. But if the author felt this was a deal-breaker, especially in a serious relationship, maybe it's valid. \n\nBut breaking up over one question might seem abrupt. The author didn't address the issue before, only reacted strongly here. Maybe he should have discussed his feelings earlier. However, if this answer revealed her true priorities, which he couldn't accept, then it's his right to end things. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's response was honest, which is important. The author might have been testing her commitment, but the way he handled it was harsh. However, if her answer genuinely made him feel unimportant, then his reaction is understandable. \n\nThe answer depends on whether the author's reaction was proportionate. Some might say he overreacted, others that he was justified. But the question is if he's in the wrong. If he's honest about his feelings and the red flag, he's not in the wrong. However, if he didn't address it earlier or handled it poorly, maybe. But the scenario is that he was heartbroken and ended it immediately. \n\nIn summary, the author's reaction is his own feeling, and while the breakup is his choice, if he didn't give her a chance to explain or if it was a spur-of-the-moment decision without prior discussion, maybe he's in the wrong. But if her response showed a lack of commitment to the relationship, then he's justified. It's a bit of a toss-up. The answer is likely B (No), but depends on context.\n"
