We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop obsession, specifically her response about going to a concert in Korea even if he was in the hospital. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The girlfriend has been into K-Pop for a while, but the breaking point was her statement about going to the concert in Korea regardless of his serious illness. The author says he didn't expect her to be serious, and he called her a psycho and broke up. Now, the question is if he's the asshole (A) or not (B).\n\nI should consider both sides. The girlfriend's behavior might be excessive, but her love for Jung Yong Hwa is a personal choice. The author tried to engage, even mentioned he's okay with the tattoo. But the key issue is when she was asked hypothetically if she'd go to the concert if he was in the hospital, her response was being completely serious. The author felt this was a dealbreaker, leading to the breakup.\n\nNow, judgments here often depend on communication. The author didn't address his feelings about her fangirling earlier, which he found okay. The problem was her response to a hypothetical scenario that he considered extreme. Maybe he should have talked to her about his concerns instead of testing her with a provocative question. By pushing her to a hypothetical situation where he's in the hospital, he might have overreacted. Her answer was honest, which he might have misinterpreted. \n\nHowever, the author's decision to break up because she's more committed to an idol she hasn't met than to their relationship could be seen as valid if he felt his emotional needs weren't met. But calling her a psycho and immediately breaking up without discussion might be harsh. The girlfriend's response was honest, but the author's reaction seems impulsive. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the girlfriend's dedication to an idol at the expense of her partner's feelings could be problematic. But since the author didn't object to the tattoo or her other behaviors, the main issue is her hypothetical response. \n\nIn terms of the \"asshole\" determination, it's about whether the author overreacted. Breaking up because of an honest answer to a hypothetical question, especially when he previously said he was okay with her other actions, might indicate that he didn't communicate his boundaries effectively. So, he could be the asshole for not addressing his feelings earlier and for reacting so strongly without understanding her perspective. \n\nBut others might say that the girlfriend's priorities are misplaced, and the author isn't wrong to leave when he realized her commitment to the idol surpasses her commitment to their relationship. However, the way he reacted (calling her a psycho) might be the part where he's in the wrong, even if his decision is understandable. \n\nI need to decide if the author's actions make him the asshole. The core issue is that he broke up based on a hypothetical scenario, which some might see as using a dramatic example. The girlfriend's honest answer doesn't necessarily make her a bad partner, but the author's immediate and harsh reaction could be seen as uncalled for, especially if he didn't discuss this with her first. So, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because of his reaction and not addressing the issue properly before the breakup. But if the hypothetical was a significant red flag for him, maybe B (not in the wrong). However, the immediate judgment and the way he ended things might lean towards A.\n"
