We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who broke up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop fandom is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the setup: they've been dating for over a month. He's not into K-Pop, but he tries to be polite. She's really into Jung Yong Hwa, fangirling a lot. He's okay with her liking him, even the tattoo. But when he asks, hypothetically, if she'd still go to the concert if he were in the hospital, she says she'd go regardless. He takes that as a deal-breaker and breaks up with her. Now he's asking if he's the asshole.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the factors here. The key issue is whether her response was a deal-breaker and if he overreacted. He mentions he was okay with the tattoo and her fangirling. The problem was her hypothetical answer to the hospital scenario. He felt heartbroken and called her a psycho, then ended the relationship.\n\nNow, relationships require mutual respect and compatibility. If her response showed that she values her fandom over the relationship in a hypothetical extreme situation, that's a red flag. But the situation is hypothetical. She didn't actually plan to go to the concert if he was sick; she was just stating her hypothetical stance. Maybe he saw this as a lack of commitment, but was it fair to end the relationship over that?\n\nOn the other hand, he brought up the hypothetical scenario, and she answered honestly. If he couldn't handle that honesty, maybe the problem is his inability to accept her passion. However, if her response indicated that her fandom would take precedence over their relationship in a crisis, that's a valid concern. But since it's a hypothetical, maybe he overreacted. Also, ending the relationship because of a hypothetical scenario might be premature, especially after only a month of dating.\n\nHe called her a psycho, which is harsh. That's a strong reaction. But he felt heartbroken. The question is whether his reaction was proportionate. If she was honest and he couldn't accept her priorities, maybe he's not the asshole. But maybe he should have handled it differently. However, the core issue is whether her response was a deal-breaker. If he couldn't handle her level of fandom, then breaking up isn't necessarily wrong. But if he's using this as a pretext, maybe he is.\n\nConsidering all that, the answer might be B (No, he's not in the wrong), because he had the right to end the relationship if her priorities concerned him. However, some might argue he overreacted. But given that he tried to be understanding and this was a deal-breaker for him, it's a judgment call. But since he's the one who ended it, and she was honest, maybe he's not the asshole.\n"
