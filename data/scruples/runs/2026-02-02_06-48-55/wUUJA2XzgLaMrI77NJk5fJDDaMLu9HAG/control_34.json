We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong after breaking up with his girlfriend over her K-pop obsession.\n\nFirst, the relationship is young\u2014both 18, been dating a month. The main issue is her fangirling over Jung Yong Hwa. The author says he tried to be understanding, even okay with the tattoo. The breaking point was when she said she'd go to the concert even if he was in the hospital. He felt betrayed, called her a psycho, and ended things.\n\nIs he in the wrong? Well, relationships are about mutual respect and compatibility. The author felt her fangirling crossed a line when it came to prioritizing a celebrity over their relationship. But was his reaction appropriate? Breaking up over one statement, especially in a short relationship, might be seen as impulsive. However, if this was a culmination of her behavior, maybe he had enough. \n\nOn the other hand, her answer was a shock because she was completely serious. Maybe he should have addressed it earlier instead of waiting for the breaking point. But he did mention trying to be understanding. The key here is whether her actions were a dealbreaker for him. If he felt it represented a lack of respect or commitment to their relationship, then his decision might be justified. Still, the abruptness and the harsh words (\"psycho\") could be seen as harsh. \n\nBut considering the context, if he felt this was a dealbreaker and he couldn't handle it, then he's not wrong. Relationships require both parties to be on the same page. If she wasn't willing to consider his feelings, then ending it was his right. So, the answer might be B (No, he's not in the wrong) because he acted based on his own boundaries, even if the reaction was intense. Alternatively, some might argue he should have communicated better. But since he did try to be understanding and this was the last straw, B makes sense.\n"
