We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author here is in the wrong. So the situation is that he broke up with his girlfriend because of her extreme love for K-Pop, specifically Jung Yong Hwa. The key point seems to be when she said she'd go to his concert in Korea even if he was in the hospital. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The guy mentions that he's okay with her fangirling, even the tattoo. But the breaking point was when she said she wouldn't go through any obstacles, even if he was sick. He found that answer so hurtful that he ended the relationship. \n\nNow, is he in the wrong? Well, relationships are about mutual respect and understanding. If someone is uncomfortable with their partner's level of devotion to something else, they might have a right to express that. But does that justify breaking up? The question is whether his reaction is proportional.\n\nThe girlfriend's response was a bit harsh, but maybe she was being fangirlish and didn't realize how serious her answer was. The guy, on the other hand, took it as a sign that she doesn't prioritize their relationship. Maybe he should have talked to her first instead of immediately breaking up. But if the answer was a dealbreaker for him, then maybe it's not his fault. \n\nHowever, the fact that he didn't confront her beforehand and just reacted impulsively might make him the asshole. Communication is key. If he had discussed his feelings about her obsession earlier, maybe they could have worked through it. But if he felt that this one statement was the final straw after building up issues, then perhaps it's his choice to end the relationship. \n\nBut is it wrong to break up because of that? It's his right to end the relationship if he's unhappy. However, the way he reacted\u2014calling her a psycho and cutting off immediately\u2014could be seen as harsh. Maybe there's a middle ground where he could have expressed his feelings instead of just ending it. \n\nOn the other hand, if her answer showed a lack of commitment to their relationship, then he had every right to leave. The problem is whether her answer was a clear indication of that. Maybe she didn't mean it that way, and he misinterpreted it. \n\nIn the end, it's a bit of a grey area. But since he's the one who acted without communication, maybe he's the asshole. Or maybe not, because if it was a dealbreaker, then he's not wrong to leave. Hmm. I'm a bit torn here. But considering that the breaking point was her answer to a hypothetical and he didn't talk to her before ending things, perhaps he's not in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
