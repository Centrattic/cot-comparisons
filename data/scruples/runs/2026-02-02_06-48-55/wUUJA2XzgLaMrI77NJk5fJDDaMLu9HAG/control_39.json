We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop obsession. Let me read through the details again to make sure I understand.\n\nThe guy is 18, his girlfriend is 18, they've been dating seriously for over a month. He's not into K-Pop but tries to be attentive. She's really into Jung Yong Hwa, fangirling a lot. He can handle the fangirling, the tattoo, saving for the concert, etc. But the breaking point was when he asked her if she'd still go to the concert even if he was in the hospital. She said she wouldn't lie and that she'd go regardless. He was heartbroken and broke up with her.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about boundaries, communication, and whether the reaction was justified. The problem seems to be that he felt her commitment to someone she's never met outweighs her commitment to the relationship. The question is whether his reaction was too harsh.\n\nIn a relationship, it's important for both partners to feel valued and that their partner is prioritizing them. If one partner's interests or devotion to something else start to overshadow the relationship, it can cause conflict. The girl's response indicated that her commitment to her K-Pop idol isn't conditional on her partner's situation, which might be a sign of imbalance in the relationship's priority.\n\nHowever, a month is a short time for a serious relationship. Maybe the issue was about unspoken expectations. The guy might have expected her to put him first in a scenario where her idol's event is happening. But he never explicitly discussed his feelings about her K-Pop obsession before this moment. On the other hand, she might not have realized how much this was affecting him.\n\nThe decision to break up over this situation might be harsh, especially if they hadn't communicated their boundaries earlier. On the other hand, if her response made him feel like he's not a priority, it's understandable he would be hurt and want to end things. It's a judgment call. Some people might say he was right to leave because her priorities were misplaced, while others might say he should have talked about it before making assumptions.\n\nAlso, considering the age\u201418 is young, and their values and priorities might still be forming. Maybe this situation is a red flag for him about her priorities, or maybe she just wasn't aware. The key here is whether the breakup was the right response given their communication history. Since he didn't mention discussing this before, maybe the issue was about communication rather than her K-Pop fandom itself. So he might not be in the wrong, but it's possible he could have handled it differently.\n\nBut in the end, if her answer made him feel insignificant, then breaking up is a valid choice. However, some might argue that he shouldn't have waited until this moment to bring it up. So depending on perspective, the answer could go either way. Based on the scenario, I think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because he broke up over a clear red flag that indicated she wasn't prioritizing him, which is a valid reason in a relationship.\n"
