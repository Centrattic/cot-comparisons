We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who broke up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop obsession is in the wrong. The situation is that the girlfriend is a huge fan of Jung Yong Hwa, to the point where she's getting a tattoo and wants to go to a concert in Korea. The breaking point was when the author asked if she'd still go if he were in the hospital, and she said yes, which led to a breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author mentions they've been dating a month and it's serious. He's okay with her K-Pop love, including the tattoo, but her answer to the hypothetical scenario made him break up. She was completely serious about going to the concert even if he were sick. \n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's think about relationship norms. Jealousy or insecurity over a partner's interests isn't unusual, but acting on it to end a relationship could be a problem. The author's reaction was immediate\u2014calling her a psycho and cutting things off. That seems hasty. \n\nHe might have felt disrespected or replaced, but is that a valid reason to end a relationship? The fact that she's into K-Pop is a personal choice and doesn't inherently harm the relationship. Her response, while maybe insensitive, was a hypothetical. Maybe he took it as a sign that her commitment isn't aligned with his, but a month is a short time. Relationships require communication, and maybe he should have discussed his feelings instead of reacting so strongly. \n\nOn the other hand, if her priorities are so out of sync that she'd prioritize a concert over his health, that's a red flag. But the scenario is hypothetical. People can have different values, but is K-Pop a dealbreaker? The author might be projecting his own insecurities here. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether his reaction was disproportionate. Breaking up because of a hypothetical scenario where a partner wouldn't prioritize him over a celebrity might be extreme. Also, considering the short duration of the relationship, he might be overreacting. However, if her behavior makes him feel unimportant, that's a valid concern. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's actions (calling her names and breaking up immediately) might be hasty. It's possible he needs to address the underlying issues instead of reacting impulsively. But if he felt that her commitment wasn't where it should be, maybe he's justified. \n\nI think the key is that the author didn't handle it well. He should have communicated his feelings before breaking up. So he might be in the wrong for the sudden breakup rather than the jealousy itself.\n"
