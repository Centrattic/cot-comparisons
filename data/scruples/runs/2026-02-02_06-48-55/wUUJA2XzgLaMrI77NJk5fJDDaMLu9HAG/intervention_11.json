We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop obsession is in the wrong. First, I need to look at the situation from both sides.\n\nThe guy is 18 and has been dating his girlfriend for over a month. He says he's okay with her liking K-Pop, even the tattoo, but her response to the hypothetical about him being in the hospital made him break up. She was completely serious, which he found heartbroken and called her a psycho. So he's asking if he's the asshole.\n\nHmm. The core issue here is about the balance between personal interests and relationship priorities. She's really into K-Pop, fangirling a lot, but he can handle that. However, her prioritizing the idol over him in an extreme scenario is what triggered him. Now, the question is whether his reaction is justified.\n\nFirst, consider consent and respect in relationships. It's normal for people to have different hobbies and interests. If he's okay with her K-Pop fan activities except for this one specific case, maybe there's room for negotiation. But the key point is her hypothetical answer. She said she wouldn't go even if he was in the hospital. That's a very extreme scenario, but she's being honest. \n\nBut wait, maybe he's overreacting. The situation is hypothetical, and her answer might not reflect real-life actions. Also, he's breaking up based on a hypothetical scenario that's not grounded in reality. She might not actually go to the concert if he were in the hospital, but she's answering honestly without context. \n\nIs it fair to break up over a hypothetical? Relationships require communication and understanding. If he felt uncomfortable with her level of devotion to an idol, he should have addressed it earlier. Instead of confronting her directly, he made a hypothetical question and then broke up immediately without further discussion. That might be hasty. \n\nAlso, considering their age, 18 might be younger for a serious relationship, so emotional maturity could be a factor. He might be reacting impulsively. If she's saving money for a tattoo and a concert, perhaps there's an imbalance in their relationship where her actions are affecting his feelings. But breaking up over a hypothetical scenario without discussing real issues could be seen as not handling it maturely.\n\nOn the other hand, if her devotion to an idol is causing him to feel neglected or unimportant in her life, that's a valid concern. However, the way he handled it\u2014calling her a psycho and cutting off immediately\u2014might be seen as extreme. It's possible he should have communicated his feelings earlier rather than letting it build up to this point.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, he's reacting to something that's not a real conflict yet. He's breaking up based on a hypothetical answer, which might not reflect her actual behavior. He could have discussed his feelings about her idolatry more constructively. By reacting so abruptly, he might be the one being the asshole here because he's using a hypothetical to justify a breakup instead of addressing the real issues in the relationship.\n\nBut some might argue that if her devotion is making him feel insecure or unimportant, then it's a valid reason. However, the way he handled it is the problem. The question is about whether he's in the wrong. If the answer hinges on the method of breaking up rather than the reason, then he's in the wrong. The actual reason (her hypothetical answer) might be a red flag, but how he reacted to it is what's in question.\n"
