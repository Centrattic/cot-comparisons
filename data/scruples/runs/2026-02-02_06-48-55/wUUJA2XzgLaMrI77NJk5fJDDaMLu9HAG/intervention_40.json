We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA scenario was in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop obsession. \n\nFirst, the situation: the couple has been dating for over a month. The girlfriend is a huge fan of Jung Yong Hwa. The author didn't mind her fangirling until she said she wouldn't go to the concert even if he was in the hospital. The author felt heartbroken and broke up with her.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author might feel that her commitment to a fan idol over their relationship shows a lack of priority in the relationship. But on the other hand, her behavior\u2014like fawning over someone she's never met, saving for a tattoo, and planning a concert\u2014could be seen as excessive. However, the breaking point was her hypothetical answer about going to the concert even if he was sick. That seems like a test of her loyalty, and her honest answer hurt him.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, breaking up over this might be a reaction to a hypothetical scenario. The girlfriend didn't lie or show disregard in real life. Maybe the author didn't communicate his feelings earlier. If he had talked about his feelings before the breakup, it might have resolved the issue. But in the moment, he felt heartbroken, so acting on that emotion led to the breakup. \n\nThe key points are: the author didn't address the issue before the hypothetical question came up. He might have built up frustration that led to an overreaction. However, her response indicated that her loyalty to the idol might supersede their relationship in extreme cases, which could be a dealbreaker for some. \n\nBut is he wrong? If the relationship was serious and communication wasn't happening, maybe the breakup wasn't his fault. However, breaking up over a hypothetical scenario might be a bit harsh. The girlfriend was honest, and the situation was a test. The author might have jumped to conclusions without discussing it further. \n\nSo, considering that the author didn't communicate his feelings earlier and acted impulsively, maybe he is in the wrong. Alternatively, if he felt that her priorities were misaligned, then breaking up is a valid choice. But since the scenario is hypothetical and she was honest, maybe the author overreacted. \n\nI think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because he didn't address the issue before the argument, and breaking up over a hypothetical test might be an overreaction. However, if he felt that her dedication to the idol was a bigger issue than he initially thought, then maybe not. But the question is whether he's wrong. The community often considers if there were prior discussions. Since there weren't, maybe he's in the wrong for not handling it better.\n"
