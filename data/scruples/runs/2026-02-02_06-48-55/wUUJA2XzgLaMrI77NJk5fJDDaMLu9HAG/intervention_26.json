We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about breaking up with a girlfriend over her K-Pop obsession. The user is 18, male, and the girlfriend is 18, female. They've been dating seriously for over a month.\n\nThe main issue seems to be the girlfriend's extreme admiration for Jung Yong Hwa, a K-Pop artist. The author mentions that he's okay with her fangirling, including her plans for a tattoo, but the breaking point was when she said she would go to his concert in Korea even if he (the author) was in the hospital. He then broke up with her, and now he's wondering if he was the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author's reaction was justified. He tried to be patient and understanding, even though he doesn't like K-Pop. He didn't mind her fangirling up until that specific comment. The girlfriend's response to the hypothetical scenario about him being in the hospital might be seen as insensitive or dismissive of his feelings. However, it's a hypothetical and maybe she didn't mean it the way he took it. But the fact that she was completely serious and didn't lie makes him feel heartbroken.\n\nNow, considering the time they've been together\u2014over a month. It's a relatively short time, but they consider it serious. The author's decision to break up immediately after this conversation is a big step. Was her comment really that bad? She was fangirling, which is common in fandoms. However, her dedication to attending a concert in Korea (which is a significant commitment) might be a red flag if it's prioritized over a relationship. But the hypothetical scenario might have been a stretch. Also, she didn't lie when asked directly, which he found hurtful.\n\nThe author's reaction could be seen as overreacting. Breaking up over a hypothetical scenario that's not a real situation might be too harsh. However, if this comment revealed a deeper issue where her priorities are not aligned with his, then maybe it's a valid reason. But the key here is whether the author had a right to expect a different response. Since they were in a serious relationship, maybe he felt that her dedication to a celebrity over a boyfriend was a deal-breaker. However, the way he handled it\u2014calling her a psycho and cutting off immediately\u2014without discussion or resolution could be seen as impulsive.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's response to the hypothetical might indicate a lack of empathy or consideration for his feelings in that moment, which is hurtful. But it's also possible that she was just being honest in a hypothetical, which doesn't reflect her real actions. The author might be overgeneralizing from a single scenario. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If the author had concerns about her fangirling affecting their relationship, he should have addressed them earlier rather than waiting for a hypothetical scenario. Breaking up immediately after one conversation could be seen as not giving her a chance to explain or change. However, if this was a culmination of small issues, maybe it's justified.\n\nConsidering the context, the author's action might be seen as a reaction to a deal-breaker for him, but the sudden breakup and the way he reacted (calling her a psycho) could be seen as harsh. On the flip side, if her priorities were indeed more on a celebrity, that's a valid reason to break up. However, the scenario is a hypothetical and might not reflect real-life actions. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the answer is A (Yes), then his reaction was excessive. If B (No), then he had a valid reason. Given that he was in a serious relationship and felt that her priorities were misplaced, maybe he's not in the wrong. But the immediate breakup and the harsh reaction might tip the scales. However, the girlfriend's response was indeed hurtful, so maybe he had a right to break up. It's a tough call. But based on the information, since the scenario is hypothetical and he didn't give her a chance to discuss, maybe the answer is A. But I'm not sure. Let me think again.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but maybe the key point is that the girlfriend's response was a deal-breaker for the author. If the author can't accept that her dedication to a celebrity is more important than their relationship, then maybe he's justified. However, the way he handled it\u2014calling her a psycho and breaking up immediately\u2014might be too harsh. But given the hypothetical scenario, he might have felt it was a test of her priorities. \n\nIn relationships, if one person's interests are causing distress and the other isn't willing to compromise, it can be a problem. However, in this case, the author didn't mind her fangirling before. The breaking point was her hypothetical answer. So maybe it's a valid reason to break up, but the manner of doing so is questionable. But the question is if he's in the wrong. If his actions were a direct response to her hypothetical answer, which he found unacceptable, then maybe not. But if the answer is a hypothetical and not a real-life action, then maybe he overreacted. \n\nConsidering all that, I think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he had a valid reason to break up given her hypothetical response, which indicated her priorities were more on a celebrity than their relationship. However, some might argue that it's an overreaction. But from his perspective, if that's a deal-breaker, then it's his right to end the relationship. So the answer is B.\n"
