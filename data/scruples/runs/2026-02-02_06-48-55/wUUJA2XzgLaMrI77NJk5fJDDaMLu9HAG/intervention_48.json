We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop obsession is in the wrong. The scenario is that the girlfriend is a huge fan of Jung Yong Hwa, to the point of wanting a tattoo and going to a concert in Korea. The breaking point was when she said she would go to the concert even if her boyfriend was in the hospital.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend mentions he's okay with her liking K-Pop, even the tattoo. The issue arises when her commitment to attending the concert despite his hospitalization. He felt heartbroken and called her a psycho, then broke up. \n\nNow, is he in the wrong? Well, breaking up is a personal decision, but the method and reasoning matter. He tried to be understanding until that specific incident. Her response might have felt dismissive of his feelings, which is a valid concern in a relationship. However, his reaction of calling her a psycho and ending the relationship immediately might be seen as overreacting, especially since he was okay with her other behaviors. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's answer might have indicated a lack of consideration for his feelings in that moment, which could be a deal-breaker for some. The key is whether her response was a deal-breaker and if his reaction was proportionate. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but others might argue that his feelings were valid. However, the way he reacted (calling her a psycho) might be seen as harsh. So maybe the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because his reaction was extreme, but I need to be cautious. Alternatively, if the user believes that the girlfriend's answer was a deal-breaker, then the author isn't in the wrong. But the question is if the author is in the wrong for breaking up. \n\nSince the user is asking for an evaluation, the answer hinges on whether the breakup was justified. If the girlfriend's response was a red line for the author, then he's not wrong. But if her response was an overreaction, he might be. However, the author's immediate lashing out and using harsh language (\"psycho\") could be seen as wrong regardless. So maybe the answer is A.\n"
