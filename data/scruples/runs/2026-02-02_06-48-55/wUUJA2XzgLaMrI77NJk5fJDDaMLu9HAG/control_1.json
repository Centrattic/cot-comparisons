We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who broke up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop obsession is in the wrong. Let's start by looking at the situation.\n\nFirst, the guy is 18 and has been in a serious relationship for over a month. His girlfriend is also 18. He mentions that she's a huge fan of Jung Yong Hwa, to the point of fangirling constantly. He's tried to pay attention but isn't into K-Pop himself. The main issue arises when she says she would go to the concert in Korea even if he were in the hospital. He reacts strongly, calls her a psycho, and breaks up.\n\nSo, the key points here are: her level of obsession, the specific statement that triggered him, and his reaction. The user wants to know if he's the asshole (AITA) or not.\n\nFirst, consider the girlfriend's behavior. Constantly fangirling about someone she hasn't met, liking every Instagram post, saving for a tattoo of his name. That's a lot. But the line is crossed when he asks about a serious hypothetical, and she's nonchalant about it. He's asking if she would go to the concert even if he were in the hospital. She says yes, no lie. That's the breaking point for him.\n\nNow, is her answer wrong? Well, it's a hypothetical, and maybe she was being dramatic. But it's a test of where she stands in the relationship. If she's willing to prioritize a celebrity she hasn't met over her actual partner in a hypothetical serious situation, that could be a red flag. But maybe she didn't mean it literally. However, her response was \"Do you expect me to lie?\" which suggests she was being truthful. \n\nFrom his perspective, this shows that her loyalty or commitment isn't there, prioritizing a K-Pop idol over him. He felt heartbroken and couldn't handle that. Breaking up might be his way of protecting himself from future hurt. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that he overreacted. A hypothetical scenario shouldn't be taken as a deal-breaker, especially in a month-long relationship. Maybe he should have talked it out instead of breaking up immediately. Also, calling her a \"psycho\" is harsh and could be seen as dismissive. But given the situation, if her answer confirmed his fears about her priorities, then his reaction might be justified.\n\nIn relationships, trust and mutual respect are key. If her behavior is making him feel second to a celebrity, that's a problem. However, breaking up over a hypothetical might be too hasty. The question is whether he's in the wrong for ending the relationship. \n\nThe girlfriend might not be in the wrong for having a K-Pop obsession unless it's affecting their relationship. But if she's unwilling to consider her partner's feelings in a hypothetical real-life scenario, that's an issue. The guy's reaction, while abrupt, might be a reflection of his boundaries. If her answer crossed a line he couldn't accept, then he's not in the wrong. But if he's being overly sensitive, then maybe he is.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer hinges on whether her hypothetical answer was a red flag or a misunderstanding. If he felt betrayed or disrespected, then his decision to break up is justifiable. So the answer would be B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
