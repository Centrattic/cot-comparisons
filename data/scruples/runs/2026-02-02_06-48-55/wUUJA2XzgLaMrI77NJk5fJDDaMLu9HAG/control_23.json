We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop obsession is in the wrong. The key points here are the context of their relationship, her actions, and the specific incident that led to the breakup.\n\nFirst, they've been dating for over a month. He mentions that he's not a fan of K-Pop but tries to be attentive. She's a big fan of Jung Yong Hwa, fangirling a lot, which he finds a bit bothersome but can understand. She's very complimentary about him, using terms like \"talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet,\" etc. She hasn't met him but is saving for a tattoo of his name. He's okay with the tattoo and the fangirling, but the breaking point was when she said she wouldn't go to the concert even if he was in the hospital. He took that as a sign that her loyalty isn't with him, leading to the breakup.\n\nNow, considering if he's in the wrong. His action was to break up because her loyalty in that hypothetical was not with him. But is her answer really a deal-breaker? The question is whether her answer was reasonable. She said she wouldn't lie, implying she'd go to the concert even if he was in the hospital. That's a hypothetical scenario, and some might argue it's an unfair or extreme test of loyalty. People can have different priorities, and her commitment to her interests might not necessarily override her relationship. However, the situation is that he was heartbroken and felt she didn't prioritize him. \n\nOn the other hand, breaking up over a hypothetical scenario might be seen as overreacting. It's possible that she was just stating her hypothetical choice without considering the emotional weight he placed on it. But if that hypothetical was important to him as a test of her loyalty, then maybe his reaction is justified. \n\nBut considering that a relationship should involve mutual respect for each other's priorities, if her K-Pop fandom is a significant part of her identity and he can't accept that, maybe the breakup is his way of addressing incompatibility. However, using a hypothetical about his health to test her loyalty seems like an extreme and unfair approach. People might have different values, and while her answer might not be ideal, it doesn't necessarily mean he's wrong to leave. Alternatively, maybe he could have communicated his feelings earlier or worked through it instead of breaking up immediately. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, relationships often require compromise. If he felt that her priorities were conflicting with the relationship's future, then his decision might be seen as a last resort. But if the issue was only about the hypothetical scenario and not about actual behavior, maybe he's in the right. \n\nI think the key here is whether her actual actions were problematic. The hypothetical was a test, and her answer was a hypothetical response. He might have misjudged the situation, using that as a reason to break up when maybe there were deeper issues. However, if her commitment to her fandom was something he couldn't accept, then breaking up isn't necessarily wrong. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (No, he's not in the wrong) because he followed through on his feelings when confronted with a hypothetical that challenged his self-worth in the relationship. However, some might argue that the hypothetical was not a real issue and that he overreacted. But since the question is about whether he's in the wrong, and given that her hypothetical answer was a deal-breaker for him, it's a personal choice, so B is more likely the answer.\n"
