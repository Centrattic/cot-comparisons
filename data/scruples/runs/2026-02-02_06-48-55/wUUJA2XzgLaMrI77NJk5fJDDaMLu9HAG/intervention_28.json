We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop fandom is in the wrong. I need to analyze the situation based on the details provided.\n\nFirst, the man is 18 and has been dating his girlfriend for over a month. She's a big fan of Jung Yong Hwa, to the point of fangirling a lot. He mentions that he doesn't care for K-Pop but tries to be attentive. The breaking point was when she said she would go to his concert in Korea even if he was in the hospital. He reacted by calling her a psycho and breaking up. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but is unsure.\n\nHmm. Let's break this down. The key issue is whether her response was unreasonable and if breaking up over it was justified. The man was okay with her liking K-Pop, even a tattoo, but her prioritizing the concert over his health was a dealbreaker. \n\nHe set up a hypothetical scenario where he's seriously ill, expecting her to show some empathy or hesitation. Her not hesitating and even saying she wouldn't lie might have made him feel undervalued. But is that a valid reason to break up? \n\nOn the other hand, maybe he overreacted. The relationship is only a month old, and such intense reactions to a hypothetical could be premature. Also, her actions might be typical for a fan. However, the fact that she was completely unfazed by his hypothetical situation might indicate a lack of emotional connection or empathy towards him, which is a big red flag.\n\nBut is it fair to end the relationship over a single conversation? Especially in a young, short-term relationship. Maybe he should have discussed his feelings earlier instead of letting it escalate. However, if her response made him feel unimportant, then his reaction might be understandable. \n\nThere's a balance between respecting her interests and expecting mutual respect in the relationship. If he's okay with most things but this was a line he couldn't cross, perhaps it's his responsibility to communicate better. But if her response showed she wasn't capable of prioritizing him in a crisis, then maybe he's justified in ending it.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether her response was genuinely insensitive or just a misunderstanding. Since she was a fan and not meeting him in real life, maybe she didn't realize the hypothetical's seriousness. Alternatively, her not showing any hesitation could be a sign of deeper issues in the relationship. \n\nIn the end, I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because he had the right to feel disrespected and ended the relationship when he felt his needs weren't met. But some might argue he could have handled it more maturely. So answer B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
