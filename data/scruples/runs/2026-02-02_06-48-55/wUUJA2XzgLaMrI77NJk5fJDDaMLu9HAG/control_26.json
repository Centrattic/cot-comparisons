We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the user is asking whether breaking up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop obsession is justified.\n\nFirst, the situation: They've been dating for over a month. The girl is really into K-Pop, specifically Jung Yong Hwa. The author mentions that he tries to be understanding, even though he doesn't care for K-Pop. The problem comes when she says she would go to the concert in Korea even if he were in the hospital. The author takes this as a sign that she doesn't prioritize their relationship, leading him to break up. \n\nNow, the key points here. The author says he's okay with her liking K-Pop, even the tattoo. The breaking point was her commitment to going to the concert despite his hypothetical serious illness. The question is whether his reaction was justified.\n\nSo, relationships require mutual respect and understanding. The author felt disrespected because she wasn't considering his feelings in that hypothetical scenario. But is that a deal-breaker so quickly? They've only been dating a month, which is not very long. Maybe she was just being a fan and didn't realize how it would affect him. Or maybe she was being overly committed to a fan interest, which he found unacceptable. \n\nBut is breaking up over this the right move? Well, he did confront her with a hypothetical that was extreme. Maybe he should have talked it through instead of just breaking up. On the other hand, if her actions (like the hypothetical scenario) made him feel undervalued, then ending the relationship isn't necessarily wrong. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. If he couldn't handle her fandom and took it as a sign of her not being committed to the relationship, then maybe he's not wrong. However, some might argue that his reaction was too harsh, especially since it's a hypothetical and maybe she didn't mean it that way. \n\nAlso, the fact that she's a fan and he's okay with most of it except this one hypothetical might mean he's overreacting. Maybe he should have communicated his feelings earlier instead of waiting until this point. \n\nAlternatively, if he felt that her priorities were not aligned with his, then breaking up could be justified. But given the short time they've been together, maybe he's reacting too quickly. \n\nHmm. The answer depends on whether the hypothetical scenario was a fair test of her commitment and whether his reaction was proportionate. If he felt heartbroken and couldn't reconcile this, maybe it's his choice. But others might say he's being too sensitive. \n\nIn the end, the question is whether he's the asshole. If the community thinks he overreacted, then he's in the wrong. If they think her commitment to her fandom overshadowed their relationship, then he's justified. \n\nLooking at similar situations, often if one partner can't accept the other's interests even after discussion, it's acceptable to end the relationship. But if it's a one-time hypothetical scenario, maybe he's overreacting. However, the fact that she was saving up for a tattoo and going to the concert shows her dedication to a fan interest, which he found problematic. \n\nGiven all that, the answer would likely be that the author is not in the wrong (B), because he ended the relationship due to a fundamental incompatibility he couldn't accept, even if his approach was abrupt.\n"
