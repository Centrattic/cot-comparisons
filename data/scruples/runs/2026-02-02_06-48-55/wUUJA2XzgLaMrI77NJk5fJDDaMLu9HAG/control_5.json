We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who broke up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop fandom was in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the situation: The guy is 18, the girlfriend is 18. They've been dating seriously for over a month. He's okay with her fangirling over Jung Yong Hwa, even the tattoo. But when he asks her hypothetical scenarios where he's in the hospital and she says she'd still go to the concert, he breaks up with her.\n\nSo, the main issue is his reaction to her hypothetical answer. Let's consider the key points. He says he's tried to pay attention to her interest, even though he doesn't like K-Pop. He's okay with her fangirling, liking every post, saving for a tattoo. The problem arises when she answers his hypothetical question seriously, which he didn't expect. He calls her a psycho and breaks up.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. From a relationship perspective, communication is key. It's possible that his hypothetical question was a test to see how she'd prioritize their relationship versus her fandom. Her answer might have made him feel insecure or unimportant, leading to the breakup. But did he handle it correctly?\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's reaction is to say she wouldn't lie. If he asked her if she'd still go to the concert even if he was in the hospital, and she answered truthfully, maybe he's taking it the wrong way. However, in a serious relationship, such a hypothetical might be a red flag for her. If she were to prioritize her fandom over his well-being, that could be a problem.\n\nBut considering they've only been dating a month, maybe it's too soon for such a test. The guy might have misinterpreted her answer. Also, the way he reacted\u2014calling her a psycho and breaking up immediately\u2014might be abrupt. However, if her answer made him realize he couldn't accept her priorities, then maybe his decision was based on his own feelings.\n\nSo, the key here is whether his reaction was justified. If the girlfriend's answer genuinely made him feel that she values her fandom over their relationship, then he's acting on his own boundaries. But if he didn't communicate his feelings beforehand and just reacted impulsively, maybe he's in the wrong. However, given the hypothetical nature, her answer could be a dealbreaker for him. So, he might not be the asshole. The answer might be B (he's not in the wrong).\n"
