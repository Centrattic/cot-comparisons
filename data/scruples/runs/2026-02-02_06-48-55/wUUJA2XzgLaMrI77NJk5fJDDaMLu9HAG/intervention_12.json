We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he broke up with his girlfriend because she was extremely into K-Pop, especially Jung Yong Hwa. She's been fangirling a lot, even talking about getting a tattoo and going to a concert in Korea. The breaking point was when she said she would go to the concert even if he was in the hospital. He found that unbearable and ended the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend's actions: she's into K-Pop, which isn't his cup of tea, but he was trying to listen. Her fangirling is pretty intense, but he says he was okay with it except for the concert comment. The key question is whether her response to the hypothetical scenario was out of line. \n\nHe asked, \"What if I was in the hospital? Would you still go?\" She answered honestly that she would, and he took that as a sign that she doesn't care about him. But is her answer really unreasonable? It's a hypothetical, maybe she meant it as a playful response, but he took it seriously. However, her love for an artist is a personal choice. If she's clear about her passion, but he's not okay with that, maybe the breakup is because he can't accept her as she is. \n\nBut then again, if he's the one who brought up the hypothetical situation and she answered honestly, maybe he's the one who should have known her limits. Or maybe she crossed a line by being so committed to a celebrity. But in relationships, people have different interests, and unless it's affecting the relationship directly, like spending way too much time or money, maybe he's overreacting. \n\nAlso, getting a tattoo of the artist's name is a big commitment. Maybe he felt disrespected because she was putting a permanent mark on her body for someone she's never met. But he said he was okay with the tattoo, so the issue was her response to the hypothetical. \n\nIn terms of communication, maybe he should have addressed his feelings earlier. If he was uncomfortable with her fangirling, he should have talked about it instead of waiting for this moment. But she didn't lie or hide her feelings; she was just being honest. \n\nSo, the question is whether ending the relationship over a hypothetical scenario and her honest answer was justified. If her commitment to a celebrity is impacting their relationship's trust or his self-esteem, then maybe he's right. But if it's just a difference in interests, then he might be the one being too controlling. \n\nI think the girlfriend's answer was honest, and maybe he's using that as an excuse to end the relationship because he's uncomfortable with her passion. Since he was okay with all the other things but not this one hypothetical response, he might be the one being the asshole. So, the answer would be A (he's in the wrong). But I'm not 100% sure. Maybe she's being unreasonable, but the way he approached the conversation with a hypothetical might have been the wrong move. Hmm.\n"
