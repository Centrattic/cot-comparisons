We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who broke up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop fandom is in the wrong. The situation is that the girlfriend is extremely into K-Pop, specifically Jung Yong Hwa. The key point is her response when he hypothetically asked if she'd go to the concert even if he was in the hospital. She said she wouldn't lie, meaning she'd still go. The author then called her a psycho and broke up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple has been dating for over a month. The girlfriend's behavior around K-Pop isn't just casual; she's fangirling a lot, saving for a tattoo, and likes every post. The author mentions that he's tried to be understanding. But the breaking point was her response to the hypothetical situation about him being in the hospital. The author felt heartbroken and ended the relationship.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. One perspective is that he overreacted. K-Pop fandoms can be intense, and while it's annoying, it's not necessarily a deal-breaker. The girlfriend didn't lie about her feelings for the artist, and her response might have been honest but not meant to hurt him. The author's reaction of calling her a psycho and breaking up immediately could be seen as disproportionate. Communication might have been the better approach before ending things.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author felt that her level of fandom was affecting their relationship or that her response indicated she wouldn't prioritize him in a crisis, maybe he had concerns. However, the hypothetical scenario is a bit extreme. People often use hypotheticals to test reactions, but in a real situation, priorities might shift. The girlfriend's response might have been honest, but it's unclear if she would actually go if he was really in the hospital. It's possible she was just fangirling and didn't mean it literally.\n\nThe author's decision to break up because of this one response might be hasty. He could have discussed his feelings instead of reacting impulsively. The fact that he was heartbroken suggests he had deeper issues with her fandom, but breaking up over this specific incident might be the wrong approach. The answer hinges on whether the author's reaction was justified. Since the girlfriend didn't lie and the hypothetical might not reflect real-life actions, the author's reaction could be seen as overreacting. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
