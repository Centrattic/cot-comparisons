We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (the guy who broke up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop fandom) is in the wrong. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation thoroughly. The guy is 18, and they've been dating seriously for over a month. His girlfriend is a huge fan of Jung Yong Hwa, a K-Pop artist. He mentions that he doesn't care for K-Pop but tries to be attentive. She's very vocal about her admiration for Jung, to the point of fangirling, and even planning a tattoo of his name. The breaking point comes when he asks her if she'd still go to a concert in Korea even if he were hospitalized, and she says she wouldn't hesitate. He then calls her a psycho and breaks up.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the boyfriend felt her obsession was excessive, especially when she prioritized the concert over his well-being. The question is whether he overreacted or was justified.\n\nI need to consider relationship dynamics. In a serious relationship, compatibility and mutual respect are important. If one partner's interests are causing discomfort or being seen as a higher priority than the other, that's a problem. But the boyfriend didn't just talk about it; he reacted impulsively by breaking up after a hypothetical scenario. \n\nThe hypothetical situation is important. He created a scenario where he's in the hospital, which is a serious situation. Her response, while shocking, might have been a hyperbolic answer to a hypothetical. Maybe she didn't mean to take it that seriously, or perhaps she was being overly fangirl. However, breaking up over a hypothetical question could be seen as a knee-jerk reaction. \n\nAlso, the boyfriend mentions he was okay with the tattoo and other aspects of her fandom before. The trigger was her hypothetical answer. It's possible he was already frustrated and used that moment as the catalyst. \n\nOn the other hand, if her actions (like the tattoo, constant fangirling) were already causing him stress, then this incident might have been the last straw. But the timing and the nature of the question are key. Asking a hypothetical in a testy way can lead to misunderstandings. \n\nAnother angle: relationships require communication. If he had concerns earlier, he might have addressed them before this point. Breaking up abruptly without prior discussion could be seen as not giving her a chance to adjust or explain her feelings. \n\nBut then again, if she admitted she wouldn't care about his health in a hypothetical scenario, that's a red flag for him. He might feel that her loyalty isn't there, which is a valid concern. However, it's a hypothetical, and people might overreact in such scenarios. \n\nThe user initially thought the author was in the wrong but wants to know if that's the case. I need to balance both sides. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's reaction might be too harsh. Breaking up over a hypothetical question, especially after already being in a serious relationship for a month, suggests that he might have acted impulsively. However, if her behavior had been a consistent issue, this could be the final trigger. The key is whether the hypothetical scenario was a fair test and if the breakup was proportionate. Since he didn't mention prior discussions, it's possible he's in the wrong for not addressing the issue earlier and overreacting to a single hypothetical answer.\n"
