We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he's breaking up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop obsession, specifically with Jung Yong Hwa. They've been dating for a month. \n\nFirst, he mentions that he doesn't care for K-Pop but tries to pay attention. She's a big fan, fangirling over the artist. He says he's okay with that, even the tattoo. But the breaking point was when she said she'd go to the concert in Korea even if he was in the hospital. He says he's heartbroken and ended it, calling her a psycho.\n\nNow, I need to assess if he's wrong. Let's break it down. The key points are: her level of devotion, her response to his hypothetical situation, and his reaction. \n\nFirst, her being a fan: K-Pop can be a big passion. People have strong feelings about their idols. He says he's okay with her liking him and the tattoo. So maybe her devotion isn't the issue here. The problem arises when she says she'd leave him in the hospital to go to a concert. That's a commitment issue, but it's a hypothetical. \n\nBut wait, he's taken a big step by breaking up after one conversation. Is that overreacting? A month is a short time, so maybe the relationship was still in the early stages. Her response could be seen as not prioritizing the relationship, but maybe she was joking or in the moment. However, he says he confirmed she was serious. \n\nIs her answer really that bad? If a partner is willing to abandon their sick partner for their idol, that's a red flag. But the scenario is hypothetical. Maybe he's jumping to conclusions. On the other hand, her actions show that her devotion is more important than their relationship in a crisis. \n\nBut he's the one who made the hypothetical scenario. Maybe he was testing her commitment. If he's insecure or felt replaced by the idol, that's on him. However, her response was a dealbreaker for him. \n\nIs breaking up over this too much? It's a personal choice, but if the relationship is only a month old, maybe it's not a huge issue. But some might say that judging someone for their passion is unfair. Others might think that prioritizing a fan relationship over a romantic one is problematic. \n\nSo, is he the asshole? If he's breaking up over a hypothetical and she's not necessarily doing anything wrong in reality, maybe he's overreacting. But if her actual behavior in the relationship was prioritizing the idol over him (like neglecting him for K-Pop stuff), that's different. However, the only concrete thing here is the hypothetical answer. \n\nSince the question is whether he's in the wrong, factors to consider: was her answer a valid dealbreaker? If he couldn't handle her devotion, maybe he should have addressed it earlier. But she didn't cross a boundary in real life; her hypothetical answer is the trigger. \n\nSo, some might say he's in the wrong for breaking up over a hypothetical. Others might say her answer showed her priorities, and he's justified. But given that it's a serious hypothetical (sick in hospital), her not prioritizing him there is a red flag. However, maybe he's using it as an excuse to end the relationship. \n\nHmm. I think it's a toss-up, but leaning towards him not being in the wrong because her hypothetical answer does indicate a potential problem in the relationship's future. But others might argue that he's not in the right to make a snap judgment based on a single conversation, especially in a new relationship. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's acting out of jealousy or insecurity, that's his problem. If her answer is a genuine red flag, then maybe not. \n\nI'm going to say he's not in the wrong (B) because her hypothetical answer does show a possible issue in their relationship's commitment. However, others might argue it's too soon to break up. But the core is her prioritizing the idol over him in an extreme scenario. So, B.\n"
