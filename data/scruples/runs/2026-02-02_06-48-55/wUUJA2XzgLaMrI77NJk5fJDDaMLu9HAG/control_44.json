We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the person who broke up is in the wrong. The situation is about a K-Pop fandom. The guy is 18, his girlfriend is 18 too. They've been dating for over a month. He says he's okay with her fangirling over Jung Yong Hwa, even the tattoo part. But when she said she would go to the concert in Korea even if he was in the hospital, he broke up with her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They've been dating for a month, which is not a long time. The guy was trying to be understanding, even when she's more complimentary about the K-Pop idol than him. But the breaking point was her statement about going to the concert despite him being in the hospital. \n\nNow, is the guy wrong for breaking up? Well, in a relationship, communication and mutual respect are key. The girl's response was very cold, saying she wouldn't lie. That must have felt really hurtful. But did he handle it right? He called her a psycho and ended it immediately. That's pretty harsh. Maybe he should have talked about his feelings instead of reacting so strongly. \n\nBut wait, the girl's actions and words might indicate a lack of consideration. If she's so committed to the idol, but the relationship isn't a priority, that's a problem. However, the guy's reaction was immediate and extreme. Breaking up because of a hypothetical scenario might be overreacting. Also, considering their short time together, maybe the guy hasn't given the relationship enough time to address such issues through communication. \n\nOn the other hand, her being so devoted to a stranger and not valuing the relationship is a red flag. But the guy's response was to end it without trying to discuss further. Maybe both have some responsibility here. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nSince he reacted with anger and broke up immediately without dialogue, that's probably not the right approach. However, the girl's answer was indeed hurtful. The key is whether the guy's reaction was disproportionate. If the girl's behavior shows she's not able to prioritize the relationship, then maybe the guy is justified. But the way he ended it might be seen as hasty. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to address issues together. If the girl was that committed to the idol, maybe they could have discussed boundaries. But he didn't give her a chance to explain or reconsider. So maybe the guy is not entirely wrong, but he's not handling it in the best way. But according to the question, is he in the wrong? If the answer is A or B, then the options are yes or no. \n\nSince the girl's statement was problematic, and he broke up because of it, maybe he's not the asshole. But his method was harsh. However, given that her answer was so callous, maybe he's justified. It's a tough call, but I think the answer is B (No), because he's reacting to a significant red flag, even if the way he reacted could be improved. But since the question is whether he's in the wrong, and the girl's answer was the main issue, the answer might be B.\n"
