We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop fandom. \n\nFirst, the situation: They've been dating for over a month. The guy isn't into K-Pop but tries to be attentive. The girlfriend is a big fan of Jung Yong Hwa, to the point of fangirling a lot, liking all his Instagram posts, and planning a tattoo. The breaking point was when he asked if she'd still go to the concert if he were in the hospital, and she said she wouldn't lie, meaning she'd go no matter what. He took that as a dealbreaker and broke up.\n\nNow, the key points to consider. The guy's issue isn't her being a fan, but her reaction to a hypothetical scenario where his health is compromised. He felt that her commitment to the artist overrode her commitment to him. But how reasonable is that expectation? In a relationship, especially one that's serious for a month, being able to prioritize each other in real emergencies is important. However, the scenario is hypothetical, and her response was honest. \n\nIs he in the wrong? Well, he acted on his feelings when he realized that he couldn't accept her level of fandom. Breaking up over a hypothetical might be extreme, but if it's about core values, maybe it's justified. However, a month is a short time for a serious relationship. Maybe he should have communicated his concerns earlier instead of waiting for this incident. On the other hand, her response was honest and not manipulative. \n\nSo, the question is whether he's the asshole. If he ended things because he couldn't accept her priorities, and she was truthful, he's not wrong. But if he overreacted to a hypothetical, then he might be. The tattoo and prior behavior didn't bother him before, so it's possible that the incident was a final straw. \n\nConsidering all that, I think the answer is B (No, he's not in the wrong). He had the right to end the relationship if her values clashed with his, especially in a scenario where her commitment to the artist might override her commitment to him. However, some might argue that the hypothetical was too extreme and he could have addressed it earlier. But since he tried to be understanding before and this was the breaking point, he's justified.\n"
