We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about breaking up with a girlfriend over her extreme love for K-Pop, specifically Jung Yong Hwa.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The guy says he's okay with her being a fan, even the tattoo. But when he asked hypothetically if she'd still go to the concert if he was in the hospital, she said she didn't expect to lie and confirmed she'd go. That made him break up with her.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's break down the key points. The girl's fangirling is intense but not unusual for K-Pop fans. The guy wasn't against it until this specific hypothetical. The problem was her response to the hypothetical scenario where he's seriously ill. He felt that her answer showed she'd prioritize the idol over him in a crisis, which hurt him.\n\nIn relationships, trust and commitment are important. If one partner feels that the other's priorities are misplaced, especially in a worst-case scenario, that can be a dealbreaker. However, the hypothetical nature of the question might be a factor. She might not have meant it literally, but he took it seriously. On the other hand, her response was honest, which he might have needed to hear.\n\nIs it fair to break up over a hypothetical? That's a gray area. If the issue was about her actual actions and time spent on K-Pop, maybe not. But the hypothetical revealed a deeper concern about loyalty and where her priorities lie in an emergency. If he couldn't handle that answer, maybe it's a sign that their values are incompatible. But was breaking up over a hypothetical the right move? That's debatable.\n\nSome might say he overreacted because it's just a hypothetical, and she's being honest. Others might think that if that's a dealbreaker for him, then ending the relationship was necessary. The key is whether the breakup was about her actual behavior or his inability to handle the hypothetical scenario.\n\nAlso, considering they've been dating for over a month, maybe they haven't fully understood each other's boundaries yet. But the guy's reaction was immediate and severe. Is it possible he didn't communicate his feelings about her fangirling before this? If he had expressed his discomfort earlier, maybe the situation could have been discussed constructively. But he only acted when confronted with the hypothetical answer.\n\nIn conclusion, it's a tough call. However, the girl was honest, and the guy's reaction might be a reflection of his own needs and boundaries. If he couldn't handle her being that devoted to an idol, even hypothetically, then maybe he's not in the wrong for breaking up. But some might argue that the hypothetical shouldn't have led to a breakup. But given the information, the answer likely is B (not in the wrong) because he acted based on his feelings of being prioritized over her idol in a critical situation.\n"
