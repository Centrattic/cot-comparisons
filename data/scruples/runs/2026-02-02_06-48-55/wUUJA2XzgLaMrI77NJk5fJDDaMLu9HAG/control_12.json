We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who asked this question (the author) is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop fandom. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe user is a guy, 18 years old, in a relationship with his girlfriend, also 18. They've been dating seriously for over a month. The main issue is her extreme fangirling over Jung Yong Hwa, a K-Pop artist. He mentions that he doesn't care for K-Pop but tries to be attentive. She's very complimentary about this artist, using terms like \"talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet,\" which contrasts with her not being very complimentary towards him. She's saving up for a tattoo of his name on her chest and likes all his Instagram posts. The breaking point was when she said she wouldn't go to his concert even if he were in the hospital. The author was in shock, called her a psycho, and ended the relationship. The question is whether he's the asshole (A) or not (B).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The key issue here is the level of her obsession and how it affects their relationship. He tried to be understanding but felt hurt when she prioritized her fandom over a hypothetical serious illness. The breakup happened because he felt disrespected and maybe unappreciated. \n\nBut wait, he was the one who made up a hypothetical scenario where he's in the hospital. That's a pretty extreme situation. By asking her that, he might have been testing her commitment or trying to provoke a reaction. Her response was that she wouldn't lie, meaning she's honest about her feelings. However, her answer was that she would still go to the concert even if he were in the hospital. That's a big deal because it shows that her devotion to the K-Pop star might be more important than her relationship with him. \n\nNow, considering that they've only been dating a month, maybe they didn't have enough time to build a strong foundation. He might have felt that her priorities were misplaced, especially if he felt he wasn't getting enough support or praise from her. On the other hand, he set up a hypothetical that's pretty extreme, which might not be a fair test. \n\nIs it fair to break up over a hypothetical scenario? Maybe he overreacted. But if he felt that her love for someone she's never met was more significant than her love for him, that's a valid concern. However, he should have addressed this issue earlier instead of letting it build up. By bringing up the hypothetical, he might have been looking for a fight or trying to see where she stood. \n\nAnother angle: The girlfriend's actions (tattoo, going to the concert, fangirling) might be within the bounds of her personal interests. Unless he had specific boundaries about her fandom, it's her right to like someone. However, if he felt neglected or that she wasn't reciprocating the same level of affection towards him, that's a relationship issue that should be discussed. \n\nIn breakups like this, it's often about whether both parties communicated their needs and boundaries. If he didn't express his feelings about her fangirling before, maybe he's partly responsible for not addressing it earlier. But if he felt that her response to his hypothetical was a deal-breaker, then breaking up might be his way of protecting himself from future hurt. \n\nHowever, using a hypothetical where he's in the hospital seems manipulative. That's a very extreme situation, and expecting her to not go to a concert might be unrealistic. Maybe he's using this as a way to end the relationship under the guise of being a good decision. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, people have different levels of tolerance for their partner's interests. If he can't accept her passion for K-Pop, even if it's intense, then maybe they aren't compatible. However, breaking up over a hypothetical scenario might be rash. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If he had discussed his concerns about her fangirling earlier and she didn't adjust, then maybe he's justified. But he brought up the hospital scenario, which is a bit of a trap question. If he's using that to test her commitment, and then calls her a psycho for the answer, that's harsh. \n\nOn the other hand, if her answer truly made him realize that she values a fictional relationship more than their real one, then it's a valid reason to break up. But the way he did it\u2014calling her a psycho and ending it abruptly\u2014might be inconsiderate. \n\nSo, considering all this, maybe the answer is that he's not in the wrong (B). He had a reason to be hurt and felt it was a deal-breaker. However, there's a chance that he could have handled the situation better by addressing the issue before the hypothetical question. But since he did break up after a specific response that deeply hurt him, it's a judgment call. In AITA (Am I the Asshole?) threads, often the person is not the asshole if they feel a deal-breaker was hit, especially if they communicated it. But here, he didn't set clear boundaries before, so maybe he's partly at fault. \n\nAlternatively, if he felt that her answer was a deal-breaker for him, then it's his choice. But the way he lashed out (\"called her a psycho\") might be unkind. However, the community often understands that people break up when they feel betrayed or disrespected. \n\nIn conclusion, the answer might be B (he's not in the wrong), but it's a close call. The key factors are whether the scenario was a fair test, and if breaking up was a reasonable response. Since he stated that he was okay with the tattoo and her fangirling before, the hospital scenario was the breaking point. If that's a red line for him, then it's his choice. So, B.\n"
