We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a breakup over K-Pop fandom. The guy is 18, his girlfriend is also 18, and they've been dating seriously for over a month. The main issue is that he broke up with her because of her extreme fangirling over Jung Yong Hwa.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. He says he's okay with her liking K-Pop and even the tattoo. The breaking point was when she said she would go to the concert in Korea even if he was in the hospital. He asked hypothetically, and she was serious in her answer, which led him to call her a psycho and break up.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's think about both sides. On one hand, he's reacting to what he perceives as a lack of consideration for his feelings. If he's been in the relationship seriously for a month, maybe he should have had these conversations earlier. But on the other hand, her response to a hypothetical about him being in the hospital seems really cold. It might feel like she's prioritizing a celebrity over her partner, which can be hurtful.\n\nBut wait, the context is important. They're both 18, which is a young age. Relationships at that age can be intense but also short-lived. The issue here might be communication. He didn't express his feelings about her fangirling before this moment, so maybe he's reacting too strongly now. Also, breaking up over such a hypothetical scenario could be impulsive. However, her response did cross a line if it made him feel unimportant in her life.\n\nAnother angle: he didn't try to address her fangirling before, only when he felt hurt by her hypothetical answer. That could mean he should have communicated his feelings earlier. But if her answer was a dealbreaker for him, maybe it's his right to end the relationship. The problem is whether her answer was as bad as he thought. She might have been testing his question or just being honest, but her seriousness could be seen as not valuing him.\n\nAlso, the fact that she's saving for a tattoo of his name shows deep commitment to the idol. If he's okay with the tattoo but not her hypothetical loyalty to the celebrity over him, there's inconsistency. So maybe he's using the hypothetical as a catalyst for other unresolved issues.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, relationships require mutual respect and communication. If he never addressed her fangirling before, and this was the breaking point, it's possible he's overreacting. However, if her answer truly hurt him and made him feel unloved, then maybe it's valid for him to end it. But calling her a psycho is harsh and might indicate poor communication. So, the answer might depend on whether the breakup was based on a fair assessment or an overreaction.\n\nConsidering all factors, the author might not be in the wrong if he felt that her response indicated a lack of commitment to the relationship. However, if he didn't address her fangirling earlier and this was an impulsive reaction, then maybe he is. Given the information, the answer could be B (he's not in the wrong) because the hypothetical scenario could be a valid dealbreaker for him if he felt disrespected. But it's a close call.\n"
