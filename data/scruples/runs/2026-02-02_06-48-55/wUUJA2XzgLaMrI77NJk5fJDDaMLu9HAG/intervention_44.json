We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, he broke up with his girlfriend because she was super into K-Pop, especially Jung Yong Hwa. They'd been dating for over a month, and he says he's okay with her fangirling, even the tattoo part. But when she said she'd go to the concert in Korea regardless of anything, even if he was in the hospital, he took it as a dealbreaker.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. They've been together a month, which isn't super long. Maybe the guy is sensitive about being compared to a celebrity his girlfriend is so into. He mentions she's not very complimentary towards him, which could be a point of insecurity. When she fangirls over someone else, maybe it makes him feel less appreciated or insecure.\n\nThe breaking point was her statement about going to the concert even if he was in the hospital. She was being serious, which he found unacceptable. But is this a valid reason to break up? Well, maybe he felt that her commitment wasn't there, but he admitted he was making up hypothetical scenarios. Maybe he was testing her, which could be seen as unfair. She didn't lie, which he found heart-breaking. But does that mean she's a bad partner? Or did he misinterpret her loyalty?\n\nAlso, considering their communication. He played along with the hypotheticals, then asked a serious question. If he was testing her, maybe he didn't set clear boundaries. She might not have realized the gravity of the question. But if she was serious, maybe he should have addressed it earlier instead of using a hypothetical to test her.\n\nThe fact that he called her a psycho and broke up immediately might be impulsive. Maybe he should have discussed his feelings more calmly. On the other hand, if her answer truly made him feel unloved, maybe it's a valid reason for him. But is it fair to end a month-long relationship over this? Also, the tattoo part was okay, but her hypothetical answer was the issue. Maybe the core issue is his insecurity and not her K-Pop fandom per se.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? He might have misread the situation or allowed his insecurity to override the actual issue. Breaking up over a hypothetical scenario might be extreme. Also, he didn't address his feelings about her not complimenting him, instead focusing on the K-Pop thing. That could be a bigger problem. Therefore, maybe the author is not in the wrong because he has valid feelings, but some might argue he overreacted. But given the context, perhaps he's justified in ending the relationship if this was a dealbreaker for him.\n"
