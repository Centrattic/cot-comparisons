We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because of her extreme love for K-Pop, specifically Jung Yong Hwa. The situation is that the girlfriend fangirls over him a lot, likes all his posts, is saving for a tattoo, and said she'd go to his concert in Korea even if the author was in the hospital. The author then called her a psycho and broke up. The answer options are A (yes, the author is wrong) or B (no, he's not).\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the scenario. The key issue here is whether the author's reaction was justified. The girlfriend's fangirling about a K-Pop artist could be a point of contention. The author says he's okay with the tattoo and her general fangirling, but this specific statement about going to the concert even if he's seriously ill is what pushed him to break up.\n\nWhat's important is the context of their relationship. The author mentions they've been dating for over a month. In a new relationship, it's possible that some boundaries and understandings haven't fully developed yet. The girlfriend's response was that she wouldn't lie, implying she's honest about her priorities. The author felt that her commitment to the concert over his well-being was a deal-breaker. \n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The question is about whether his reaction was appropriate. Breaking up over this could be seen as a judgment call. If the author values being a priority in the relationship, and her statement indicated that her idol's concert would take precedence over his health, that's a valid concern. However, it's also possible that the girlfriend was just testing his hypothetical scenario, but she clarified she was serious when asked. \n\nThe author's anger and calling her a psycho might be considered an overreaction. Ending the relationship based on one statement could be hasty, especially if there's no prior history of such behavior. On the other hand, if this revealed a fundamental incompatibility in their relationship values, then the breakup might be justified. \n\nIt's tricky because there's no clear right or wrong here. Some people might think the author is wrong to end the relationship over a K-Pop idol's concert, especially since he said he was okay with the tattoo and her liking the artist. Others might say that if her idol's importance overpowers her commitment to the author in a critical situation, that's a problem. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's lack of empathy in her response could be a red flag. She didn't express concern for his hypothetical hospitalization, which might be a deal-breaker for some. The author's decision could stem from feeling that his needs and well-being aren't a priority for her. \n\nBut the tattoo and previous fangirling were okay with him. So maybe he was okay with her devotion to the idol until this point. However, the scenario presented (going to the concert over his hospitalization) is extreme. Whether that's a valid reason to break up is subjective. \n\nIn terms of the question, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer would depend on whether the breakup was an overreaction or a justified response to a serious issue. Since the author was okay with her other K-Pop behaviors but this one statement about the concert (especially under hypothetical illness) was the breaking point, it's a personal choice. \n\nHowever, breaking up because her devotion to an idol she hasn't met is extreme might be seen as projecting his own discomfort onto her. The author might be the asshole if he's being too controlling or not considering her perspective. Alternatively, if he felt disrespected and that his health wasn't a priority, then it's valid. \n\nBut given the information, the author's reaction (calling her a psycho and breaking up immediately) seems harsh. The girlfriend's statement was a hypothetical, and her serious answer might not reflect real-life actions. The author's response could be seen as not giving her the benefit of the doubt, leading to a quick and judgmental breakup. \n\nTherefore, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because his reaction was disproportionate and he didn't consider that the scenario was hypothetical, possibly leading to a hasty decision. But others might say B (no) because if this was a deal-breaker for him, he's within his right to end the relationship. \n\nGiven the lack of prior issues and the fact that the author was previously okay with her fangirling, but this one statement indicated a potential lack of support in a critical situation, it's a matter of personal boundaries. However, the way he ended the relationship (calling her a psycho) is unkind. So maybe he's in the wrong for the way he reacted, even if his reason is understandable. \n\nBut the question is about whether he's in the wrong for breaking up over her K-Pop love. The method of breakup (calling her a psycho) is problematic, but the decision to break up might be seen as his right. So the answer could be B (no), because his feelings are valid, even if the approach was harsh. However, the core issue is whether her fangirling is a legitimate reason to break up. \n\nIn the xkcd What If? style, it's more about the perspective. The author might not be in the wrong because he felt that her priorities were not aligned with his. But the way he handled it could be the problem. The question is about the justification of the breakup, not the method. \n\nSince the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up, and not the method of breaking up, the answer would depend on the reason. If her response showed a lack of empathy, which is a major issue, then the author isn't in the wrong for ending things. So B (no) might be the answer. \n\nBut others might argue that K-Pop fandom is a personal choice and not a valid reason to break up. The author's reaction could be seen as judgmental. However, if the girlfriend's response indicated that she would prioritize the idol over her partner's health, that's a significant issue. \n\nGiven that, the answer is B (no). The author is not in the wrong for breaking up if he felt that her commitment to the idol over his well-being was unacceptable. However, the way he broke up (calling her a psycho) is unkind, but the question is about being in the wrong for the breakup itself, not the harshness. So the answer is B.\n"
