We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading the situation carefully.\n\nThe user is a guy who broke up with his girlfriend over her extreme love for K-Pop, specifically Jung Yong Hwa. They've been dating for over a month. He mentions that while he doesn't care for K-Pop, he tries to be attentive. The girlfriend is really into this artist, fangirling a lot, which he finds a bit annoying but understands. He's okay with her liking him, even saving money for a tattoo of his name. The breaking point was when she said she would go to his concert in Korea even if he was in the hospital. He confronted her with a hypothetical where he was in the hospital, and she said she would still go. He got heartbroken and ended the relationship. Now he's asking if he's the asshole here.\n\nSo, the question is whether he was wrong to break up. Let's break down the key points. \n\nFirst, their relationship duration is over a month. That's not very long, but it's enough to have some depth. The guy seems to be okay with her being a fan of the artist, even the tattoo. The issue arises from her hypothetical response about attending the concert despite his hospitalization. \n\nThe hypothetical scenario is a test. He's asking if her loyalty to the artist would override her commitment to him. Her answer was that she would still go, which he took as a sign that her devotion to the artist is more important than their relationship. He then dumps her, calling her a psycho. \n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. On one hand, testing her with a hypothetical might not be fair. Hypotheticals can be tricky because people might not take them as seriously as the other person expects. She might have been taken aback by the question and not realized the emotional weight he was placing on it. Her response was honest, but maybe not the one he wanted. \n\nOn the other hand, he reacted strongly by calling her a psycho and ending things. That reaction is pretty harsh. If he was hurt, ending the relationship might be his way of dealing with the hurt, but he needs to consider if this was a deal-breaker for him. Maybe he should have discussed his feelings with her further instead of making an immediate, emotional decision. \n\nAlso, the fact that she's saving for a tattoo of his name (the artist's) might be a sign of her dedication to this interest, but it's not uncommon for people to have hobbies or interests that their partners don't share. The key issue here is the hypothetical scenario and her response. Did her answer really indicate that she would prioritize the artist over their relationship? She might have been caught off guard and didn't realize that the question was about testing her commitment. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If he felt that her devotion to K-Pop was affecting their relationship, maybe he should have addressed it earlier. Instead of using a hyperventual scenario, perhaps discussing his feelings about her fandom and how it makes him feel could have led to a better understanding. \n\nBut then again, he might have felt that her hypothetical answer was a red flag. If she was okay with going to the concert even if he was in the hospital, maybe he saw it as her not prioritizing their relationship. However, this is a hypothetical and real-life situations can be different. It's possible that in reality, she would have a different reaction. \n\nHe ended the relationship based on her hypothetical answer. That seems impulsive. People often test each other with hypotheticals, and the answers might not reflect real-world behavior. Also, breaking up over this might be overreacting, especially since he was okay with other aspects of her fandom before. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the girlfriend isn't necessarily at fault for answering honestly. The guy's reaction of calling her a psycho and breaking up immediately might be the issue. He could have had a more constructive conversation. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for overreacting and making a hasty decision. \n\nBut if he felt that this was a deal-breaker and he couldn't handle her prioritizing someone he doesn't like, even hypothetically, then maybe it's his right to end the relationship. However, the way he did it\u2014calling her names and acting impulsively\u2014could be problematic. \n\nThe key is whether the response was a valid reason to end the relationship. Since the answer was hypothetical, and they had only been dating a month, maybe it's too early to make such a judgment. He might need to reflect on whether this was a real issue or just a trigger based on his insecurity. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's reaction was extreme, but the situation is complex. However, the question is if he's in the wrong. If the answer hinges on whether his reaction was appropriate, then maybe he is the asshole for overreacting. But if the content of her answer was legitimate cause for concern, then he's not. But since it's a hypothetical and the rest of their relationship was okay, I think he's the one who overreacted. So the answer is A (he is in the wrong).\n"
