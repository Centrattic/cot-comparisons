We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he broke up with his girlfriend because of her extreme love for K-Pop, specifically Jung Yong Hwa. The key point seems to be her response when he asked if she would still go to the concert even if he was in the hospital. She said she wouldn't lie and that she would still go.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They've been dating seriously for over a month. The girl is really into K-Pop, which he's not into, but he's tried to be attentive. She's complimentary more towards the K-Pop star than him, which might have been building up some resentment. The breaking point was her response about going to the concert even if he was sick.\n\nIs her response unreasonable? If someone is in a serious relationship, expecting their partner to prioritize them over a celebrity might be a fair expectation. The girlfriend's answer indicated that her loyalty or priorities were with the K-Pop star over her boyfriend, which could be a deal-breaker. But then again, maybe it's about how he handled the situation. He did make a hypothetical scenario that might be extreme. If she's saving up for a tattoo of his name and wants to go to a concert in Korea, maybe her dedication is intense, but does that mean she's a \"psycho\"? His reaction was to call her that and end the relationship immediately. \n\nNow, is the author wrong? Well, breaking up over this could be seen as his choice, but was it justified? If she was completely serious and he couldn't handle that level of commitment to a celebrity over him, maybe he's not the asshole. However, maybe he should have addressed this earlier instead of letting it build up. Also, making up hypotheticals to test her might not have been the best approach. \n\nOn the other hand, if she's okay with going to the concert despite his serious illness, that might indicate a lack of consideration or emotional support for him. In a relationship, partners usually expect each other to prioritize each other in critical situations. Her answer could have made him realize that her loyalty isn't where it needs to be. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author might not be in the wrong. He had valid reasons for feeling hurt and decided to end the relationship based on her response. However, maybe he could have handled it more calmly, but the question is about being in the wrong, not about handling it perfectly. The answer is likely B (No, he's not the asshole).\n"
