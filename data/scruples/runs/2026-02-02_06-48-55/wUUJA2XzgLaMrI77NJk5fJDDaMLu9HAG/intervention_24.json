We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her extreme love for K-Pop. The situation is that the girlfriend is a huge fan of Jung Yong Hwa, to the point of fangirling a lot, saving for a tattoo, and even saying she'd go to his concert in Korea even if her partner was in the hospital. The author then breaks up with her, thinking she's a psycho.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The guy felt heartbroken when she said she'd go to the concert even if he was in the hospital. That's a pretty significant commitment to her fandom over their relationship. But he's also the one who asked the hypothetical question to test her. Maybe he shouldn't have pushed that far? On the other hand, if her response showed that her commitment to the idol was more important than her partner, that might be a valid reason to break up.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction was honest, but maybe the level of her commitment was a deal-breaker for him. However, breaking up immediately after that might be a strong reaction. The question is whether he's in the wrong for breaking up. \n\nHe mentions he's okay with the tattoo and other things, but her answer to the hospital scenario was the last straw. It's a matter of priorities. If he felt that her loyalty to the idol was more important than their relationship in a critical situation, then maybe his reaction is understandable. But is breaking up the right response? Alternatively, maybe they should have discussed their expectations earlier.\n\nIn some perspectives, if someone's idol worship affects the relationship's dynamics, it's a valid issue. However, the line between a fandom and a relationship problem can be blurry. If she was honest and he realized it was a deal-breaker, then breaking up isn't necessarily wrong. But others might argue that the guy overreacted. \n\nI need to decide if the author's actions made him the asshole. The key points are: he asked a hypothetical question, she answered honestly, he didn't like the answer, and broke up. Since he was okay with the other aspects, maybe the hospital question was a test, and her answer revealed something he couldn't accept. In that case, breaking up isn't the asshole move. But if he should have communicated his feelings earlier, then maybe he's at fault. However, from the context, it seems like the final straw was her answer, which he confirmed was serious. So he acted based on that. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (he's not in the wrong) because he had a valid reason that he communicated, even if it was sudden. Others might say A, but I think B is more likely correct here.\n"
