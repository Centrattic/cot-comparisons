We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop obsession is in the wrong. The situation is that the girlfriend is really into K-Pop, specifically Jung Yong Hwa. The guy says he's okay with her fangirling, even the tattoo. But when he asked if she'd still go to the concert if he was in the hospital, she said yes, and he broke up with her.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The main issue here is the girlfriend's level of fangirling. The author says he's okay with her liking the artist, the tattoo, etc., but the breaking point was her willingness to go to the concert even if he was very sick. The question is whether the author was wrong to break up because of that.\n\nSo, is fangirling over a celebrity to the point of prioritizing them over a partner's well-being an issue? The girlfriend's response suggests that her commitment to the fan experience is stronger than her commitment to her partner in a crisis. That's a red flag in a relationship, but it's subjective. Some might see it as normal fandom, others as a lack of consideration.\n\nThe author's reaction is immediate and extreme\u2014he calls her a psycho and breaks up. While the response seems harsh, he did feel heartbroken and it's his right to end a relationship if he feels disrespected. However, maybe he could have addressed the issue more constructively before breaking up. But given the context, he might have felt that the situation was a deal-breaker.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's answer was honest, and maybe the author expected a different response. However, her answer didn't lie, which shows she was truthful about her feelings. But the problem is whether that response was unreasonable. If her fandom is so consuming that she'd prioritize it over her partner's health, that's a significant issue.\n\nThe author's actions were sudden, and breaking up over one question might be seen as impulsive. However, the underlying issues had been building up through her continuous fangirling. The key is whether the author's reaction was disproportionate. He had been okay with the fangirling before, so maybe this was the final straw indicating deeper incompatibility.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, it's about whether the author's actions were justified. If the girlfriend's behavior was crossing a line that he couldn't accept, then he's not the asshole. But if he overreacted without considering other factors, then he might be. However, given that he had been tolerating the fangirling and this specific incident was a deal-breaker, it's plausible he's not in the wrong.\n"
