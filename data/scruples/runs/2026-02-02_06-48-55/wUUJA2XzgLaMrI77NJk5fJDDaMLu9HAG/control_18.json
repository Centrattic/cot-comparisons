We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop fandom is in the wrong. The situation is that she's really into Jung Yong Hwa, to the point of saving for a tattoo and wanting to go to a concert. The breaking point was when he asked if she'd go to the concert even if he was in the hospital, and she said she wouldn't lie, implying she'd go regardless. He then broke up with her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The guy says he's okay with her liking K-Pop and even the tattoo. The problem arose from her response to the hypothetical scenario. The key here is whether her answer was a dealbreaker and if his reaction was justified.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The guy might have felt that her prioritizing the idol over their relationship was a betrayal of trust or commitment. However, it's also possible that he didn't communicate his feelings about this before, leading to an abrupt breakup. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's response could be seen as not considering the emotional impact on her partner. If she was completely serious about going to the concert despite his being in the hospital, that might indicate a lack of empathy or consideration for his feelings. But then again, maybe she took the question as hypothetical and not a serious commitment test.\n\nIs breaking up over this a reasonable action? If the guy felt that her dedication to the idol was more important to her than their relationship, then maybe he's justified. But if he didn't address this earlier and just reacted strongly to one comment, that could be seen as him overreacting. \n\nAlso, the fact that they've been dating for a month might mean they haven't fully discussed their values and boundaries yet. In that case, the breakup might be based on a misunderstanding rather than a clear incompatibility. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on whether the breakup was a proportionate response to her behavior. If he had been okay with her fandom until this incident, but this specific answer made him realize it's not compatible, then maybe not. However, if he didn't talk about his feelings beforehand and just lashed out, then he might be the asshole for not communicating properly. \n\nBut given that the question is a yes/no on whether he's in the wrong, the answer likely hinges on whether her response was so extreme as to warrant breaking up. Since he was okay with the tattoo and other things, but this one comment about the hospital was the final straw, it's possible he's justified. However, some might argue that it's his responsibility to communicate his feelings better instead of just breaking up. \n\nHmm. The community often looks at whether the action was a reaction to something that was a dealbreaker. If she's willing to prioritize an idol over her partner in a serious situation, that's a major red flag. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But others might say he didn't handle it maturely. I think the answer would be B (not in the wrong) because the response to that specific question seems to cross a line of commitment, and he had the right to end the relationship if that's unacceptable to him.\n"
