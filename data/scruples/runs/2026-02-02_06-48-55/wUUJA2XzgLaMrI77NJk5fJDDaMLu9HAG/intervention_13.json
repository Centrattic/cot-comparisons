We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop obsession was wrong. The key points here are the girlfriend's behavior and the author's reaction.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend is into K-Pop, specifically Jung Yong Hwa. She's fangirling a lot, talking about him, liking his posts, and even planning a tattoo. The author says he's okay with all that. But the breaking point was when she said she'd go to his concert in Korea even if he (the author) was in the hospital. He took that seriously, was heartbroken, and broke up with her.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. On one hand, the girlfriend was fangirling a lot, but she hasn't met the artist. The author tried to engage, but there's a limit to how much someone can tolerate such enthusiasm. The comment about the concert during a hospital scenario might have been a test of loyalty, and the girlfriend's refusal to lie could indicate she wasn't willing to compromise her honesty, even in a hypothetical. \n\nOn the other hand, the author made a hypothetical situation that's extreme. The girlfriend's response was honest, but maybe the author overreacted. Relationships require communication and understanding. If the author felt that her dedication to K-Pop was more important than their relationship, maybe the breakup is a result of unresolved issues. However, breaking up over a hypothetical scenario might be hasty. \n\nBut considering the girlfriend's actions\u2014talking incessantly about the artist, fangirling more than complimenting him, and the tattoo\u2014maybe the author had been feeling overshadowed for a while. The final comment pushed him to act. However, is breaking up over this a justified reaction? It's possible the author didn't address his concerns earlier, leading to this sudden decision. \n\nBut the girlfriend's response to the hypothetical was honest. If the author was using that as a litmus test for her commitment, then maybe he's being unfair. The question is whether the author's reaction was disproportionate. If the girlfriend was being honest and the author couldn't handle that, maybe he's the one with issues. But if the author felt that her devotion to K-Pop was affecting their relationship's balance, then his decision makes sense. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit subjective. However, since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, the answer might depend on whether breaking up over a hypothetical scenario is too harsh. If the author had communicated his feelings earlier, maybe. But in this case, he reacted strongly to one comment. So perhaps the author is not entirely in the wrong. But maybe the girlfriend's response wasn't as bad as he thought. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the author felt that his relationship was being overshadowed, and he made a difficult decision based on his feelings.\n"
