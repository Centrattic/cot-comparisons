We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author is a guy who's been dating his girlfriend for over a month. She's really into K-Pop, especially Jung Yong Hwa. He's okay with her fangirling, even the tattoo part. But when she says she'd go to his concert in Korea in November no matter what, he asks, \"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\" She doesn't hesitate and says yes. He gets heartbroken and breaks up with her, calling her a psycho.\n\nHmm. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my opinion. Let's break it down. \n\nFirst, the core issue is her commitment to her K-Pop idol versus her commitment to the relationship. The author is upset that she would prioritize a concert over his well-being. But is that fair? \n\nHe asked a hypothetical: if he were in the hospital, would she still go? She answered honestly, which he didn't expect. Her answer made him feel unloved. But maybe her answer isn't about him. She's a fan, and her hypothetical is about her passion. \n\nIs it reasonable to expect that a partner would choose a relationship over a concert? Maybe, but not everyone values things the same. He's breaking up because he feels she values someone she hasn't met over him. But he's been dating her for a month. That's not long. Maybe he's reacting too strongly.\n\nAlso, he called her a psycho and broke up abruptly. Even if he's hurt, is that the right way to handle it? Communication is key in relationships. Maybe he should have talked things through instead of breaking up immediately.\n\nOn the other hand, if her answer really does indicate that she doesn't prioritize their relationship, then maybe it's valid for him to end it. But is it her fault for being into K-Pop? That's her interest. The problem is the prioritization, not the interest itself.\n\nHer commitment to the concert might make him feel insecure. But maybe he should have addressed it earlier. He said he was okay with the tattoo, but this hypothetical pushed his buttons. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, maybe both are at fault. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If he broke up because her hypothetical answer showed she wouldn't prioritize him, then he's not in the wrong. However, if he overreacted by breaking up immediately and called her names, that could be his fault. \n\nBut in the scenario, he states he was heartbroken and called her a psycho. That's harsh. His reaction might be inconsiderate. He could have discussed his feelings instead of cutting her off. \n\nAlternatively, if her answer truly showed that she wouldn't support him in a serious situation, then ending the relationship is reasonable. However, the hypothetical is extreme, and maybe he took it as a personal betrayal rather than just a statement of her fandom. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because he had the right to feel his feelings and decide the relationship wasn't right for him. But his method of breaking up was abrupt and harsh. However, the key is whether he's in the wrong for breaking up. If her answer indicated a lack of commitment to their relationship, then he's justified. But if she was just being a fan, then he's overreacting. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, not in the wrong). He's allowed to prioritize his feelings and break up if he feels unappreciated or not a priority. Even if her answer was about her fandom, he's entitled to end the relationship if it causes him pain. However, the way he handled it could be better, but the question is about being in the wrong, not the method. So B.\n"
