We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who broke up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop fandom) was in the wrong. The options are A for yes and B for no. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, the situation: The girlfriend is a big K-Pop fan, specifically of Jung Yong Hwa. She's fangirling a lot, which the author says he finds a bit annoying but tries to be understanding. The key moment was when the author asked her if she'd still go to the concert if he was in the hospital. She didn't lie and said she'd go, which led him to break up with her.\n\nNow, considering if the author was wrong. The main points to consider are:\n\n1. **Communication Issues**: Did the author address his concerns calmly? He said he's been okay with most things, but this last comment was a deal-breaker. However, he used a hypothetical scenario that's a bit extreme. Maybe he should have communicated his feelings earlier instead of waiting until this point.\n\n2. **Hypothetical Scenario**: The question about the hospital is a bit of a loaded one. It's a drastic situation, and the girlfriend's honesty in that context might not reflect her actual feelings in a real situation. But the author might have felt that her response showed a lack of prioritizing their relationship.\n\n3. **Reaction to Her Response**: The author called her a \"psycho\" and ended the relationship immediately. That's a strong reaction. Even if he was hurt, a more measured approach might have been better. Breaking up over a hypothetical, especially one that's not a real situation, could be seen as overreacting.\n\n4. **Mutual Respect and Understanding**: The girlfriend's actions (tattoo, saving money for a concert) show commitment to her passion, but the author might feel it's overshadowing their relationship. However, he should have discussed this earlier rather than using an extreme hypothetical to test her loyalty.\n\n5. **Expectation of Honesty**: The girlfriend answered honestly, which is fair. The author might have expected a more reassuring answer, but that's a bit unrealistic. People might not lie in hypotheticals, especially if they're not real.\n\nPutting it all together, the author's immediate reaction and the way he ended the relationship might be the issue. He could have handled things more maturely. But the question is whether he was in the wrong. The fact that he broke up over a hypothetical and a strong reaction like calling her a psycho could suggest he's at fault. However, if he felt disrespected by her priorities, maybe there's some validity in his perspective. But overall, the way he handled it seems hasty and possibly inconsiderate. So, I think the answer is A, but there are nuances.\n"
