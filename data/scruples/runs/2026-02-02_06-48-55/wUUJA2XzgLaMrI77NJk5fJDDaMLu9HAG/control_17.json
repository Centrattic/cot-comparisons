We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user wants to know if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that he broke up with his girlfriend because she fangirls over Jung Yong Hwa, a K-Pop artist, and her response about going to a concert even if he was in the hospital.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author mentions that he's okay with her liking K-Pop up to the point where she said she wouldn't miss the concert even if he was sick. That response made him break up with her. Now, is he the asshole here?\n\nLet me think about the dynamics here. The girlfriend's fangirling seems pretty intense. She's saving for a tattoo, likes all his Instagram posts, and is planning a concert in Korea. But the author is okay with that part. The problem arises when he tests her loyalty by asking if she would still go to the concert if he were in the hospital. Her answer was that she wouldn't lie, meaning she would go. That's when he called her a psycho and broke up.\n\nHmm. So, the author set up a hypothetical that's a bit extreme. Maybe he was trying to see how she would respond. But her answer showed that she prioritized her K-Pop idol over her partner in a hypothetical critical situation. That could be a dealbreaker for some people. The author felt heartbroken and decided to end the relationship. \n\nBut is he in the wrong? Well, he didn't force her to lie. Her answer was honest, which he didn't like. But does that make her a psycho? That's probably an overreaction. However, he had the right to end the relationship if this was a dealbreaker for him. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the question is about whether he overreacted. If her behavior was already an issue and this was the final straw, then maybe he's justified. But if he's being overly possessive or insecure, maybe he's the problem. \n\nBut according to the situation, he says he's okay with the fangirling and the tattoo. The issue is her hypothetical response. The key here is whether his reaction was disproportionate. Breaking up because she would go to a concert in Korea instead of being with him if he were in the hospital is a big deal. However, it's also his right to end the relationship if her priorities clash with his values. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, if the question is about moral wrongdoing, it's more about whether his action was justified. Since he decided that this was a dealbreaker, he's not necessarily in the wrong for breaking up. However, if the community here (like in an AITA context) considers that he overreacted, then maybe he's the asshole. But given that he's stating his feelings and making a choice based on his boundaries, he might not be in the wrong. \n\nSo, the answer is probably B (No, he's not in the wrong). Because he's allowed to have boundaries and if this was the final straw, he's not the asshole. The girlfriend's answer was honest, but if it's a dealbreaker, then ending the relationship is his choice. However, the way he called her a psycho might be a bit harsh, but the action of breaking up isn't.\n"
