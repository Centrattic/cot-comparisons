We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the guy who broke up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop obsession is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, their relationship context: they've been dating for over a month. The main issue is her fangirling over Jung Yong Hwa. He mentions he doesn't care for K-Pop but tries to be attentive. He's okay with her liking him, even the tattoo. The breaking point was when she said she'd still go to the concert even if he was in the hospital.\n\nNow, considering the scenario where she's not meeting the idol but just attending a concert. She's saving up for a tattoo and likes all his social media posts. The key here is her reaction when he asked if her commitment to the concert would hold even if he was seriously ill. She didn't lie and said she wouldn't hesitate. The guy felt heartbroken and ended the relationship.\n\nThe core issue is about boundaries and expectations in the relationship. He might feel that her dedication to someone she's never met is more important than their relationship. However, she might see her K-Pop fandom as a personal interest not directed at replacing him. The question is whether his reaction was justified.\n\nBreaking up over this could be seen as a reaction to feeling undervalued. If she was completely honest and he felt that her priorities were misaligned, then maybe he's not in the wrong. On the other hand, maybe he overreacted, especially since he said he was okay with the tattoo and other aspects. But the hospital question was a hypothetical test, and her honesty triggered his decision. \n\nSince he didn't force her to lie and she was truthful, which he didn't like, it's possible that he's the asshole for breaking up over something he knew was part of her personality. Alternatively, if he felt it was a deal-breaker from the start, maybe it's not his fault. But given that he tolerated it until this point, maybe he's in the wrong for not addressing it earlier or for making a hypothetical that led to the breakup. \n\nBut considering he was the one who created the hypothetical and was the one who ended it, perhaps he's not the asshole. However, others might argue that he's being overly sensitive. It's a bit of a tough call, but since he's the one who initiated the breakup and there's no prior history of this being a major issue, maybe he's not in the wrong. He's acting on his feelings of not being prioritized, which is a valid concern in a relationship.\n"
