We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (the guy) is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop fandom, specifically her extreme love for Jung Yong Hwa.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. They've been dating for a month, and he's okay with her being a fan, even some of the more extreme aspects like the tattoo. But the breaking point was when she said she wouldn't go to the concert even if he (the author) was in the hospital. She was completely serious, which made him break up with her.\n\nNow, the key points here. The guy tried to engage with her interest, even though he doesn't like K-Pop. He's accepted the tattoo and her fangirling. But when he posed a hypothetical where he's in the hospital, her response was that she would still go. That's where he felt heartbroken and ended things.\n\nSo, the question is: Was he in the wrong? Let's consider both sides. \n\nOn one hand, he had a right to feel hurt and disrespected if he felt her commitment to him was less than her commitment to a celebrity. If a partner can't prioritize their significant other over a celebrity in a hypothetical extreme situation, that could be a deal-breaker. His reaction was intense (calling her a psycho and breaking up), but given the context, some might argue it's understandable if he felt that her devotion to K-Pop overrode her care for him.\n\nOn the other hand, her response might have been an overreaction to a hypothetical situation. Maybe she was being playful or didn't realize how serious he was. But she was completely serious, which he confirmed. However, is it fair to break up over a hypothetical scenario? Also, considering they were only dating a month, maybe his reaction was too hasty. But relationships are about compatibility, and if her priorities clash with his, that's a valid issue.\n\nAnother angle: The guy tried to communicate his feelings by presenting a hypothetical. She responded in a way that he found unacceptable. He made his decision based on her response. In relationships, communication is key. If he felt that her answer showed she didn't value him, breaking up could be seen as his right.\n\nBut was he wrong? If she was being extreme in her fandom, but the issue was her hypothetical response, which might not reflect real-life actions. However, her reaction showed that her fandom was more important than their relationship in her mind, which is a red flag. So, he might not be the asshole here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe he overreacted. Breaking up over one question might be too quick, especially if her fandom isn't affecting their relationship otherwise. But if that's a core value for him\u2014needing to be a priority\u2014then it's justified.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the answer is B (No, he's not in the wrong). He had a valid reason if her actions showed that her fandom was more important than their relationship. The hypothetical scenario tested her priorities, and her response indicated that. So, he's justified in ending the relationship based on that.\n"
