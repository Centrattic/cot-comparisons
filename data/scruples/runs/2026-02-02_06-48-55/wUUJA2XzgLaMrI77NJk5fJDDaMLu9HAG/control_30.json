We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop obsession. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe guy is 18, and they've been dating seriously for over a month. His girlfriend is into K-Pop, specifically Jung Yong Hwa. He tries to be supportive but is bothered by her fangirling. She's complimentary towards the artist in a way that he finds excessive. She likes every post on Instagram, is saving for a tattoo, and wants to go to a concert in Korea. The breaking point was when he asked what if he were in the hospital, and she said she would still go. He took that as her prioritizing the idol over him, leading to the breakup.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. First, relationships are about mutual respect and communication. The girl's actions might be seen as obsessive, but it's her personal choice unless it's affecting their relationship. The author's issue is that her commitment to the idol seems to outweigh her commitment to him. The key point here is her response to the hypothetical situation. If she was willing to leave him in the hospital to go to a concert, that's a red flag for him. But is that a valid reason?\n\nIn the context, they've been dating a month but are 18, so maybe they're still figuring things out. The girl might not have realized how her actions were affecting him. The author tried to be supportive but eventually felt disrespected. The question is whether his reaction was justified. Breaking up over this is a big decision, but if her behavior made him feel unimportant, maybe it's his right to end it. However, maybe he should have communicated better before ending things. But according to the story, he confirmed she was serious and then acted. \n\nOn the other hand, her prioritizing a fictional scenario where her partner is in the hospital might seem extreme. But it's a hypothetical, and real-life situations might be different. The author's feelings are valid, and if he can't accept her idol worship to that extent, ending the relationship isn't necessarily wrong. However, some might argue that he overreacted. But since the question is about being in the wrong, if the author's actions were a response to something that made him feel disrespected, maybe he's not in the wrong. So, the answer would be B (No).\n"
