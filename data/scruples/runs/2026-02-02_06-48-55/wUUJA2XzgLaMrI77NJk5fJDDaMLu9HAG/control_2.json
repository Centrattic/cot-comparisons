We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop obsession is in the wrong. The situation is that the girlfriend is extremely into Jung Yong Hwa. She fangirls a lot, saves money for a tattoo, and when the boyfriend asked if she'd go to the concert even if he was in the hospital, she said yes. He then broke up with her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend says he's okay with her liking K-Pop, including the tattoo. The breaking point was her statement about going to the concert even if he was seriously sick. He felt heartbroken and called her a psycho, ending the relationship.\n\nIs this a valid reason to break up? Well, the key is whether her response was a dealbreaker. The question is about whether he was in the wrong. \n\nOn one hand, he felt betrayed or hurt by her prioritizing a celebrity over her partner's well-being. On the other hand, her answer was honest, and he might have set up a scenario to test her commitment. Maybe he didn't communicate his feelings about her obsession before, so she didn't know it was a problem. \n\nBut breaking up over a hypothetical situation where she's stating her truth could be seen as extreme. However, if this was a long-standing issue and the hypothetical was the last straw, then maybe it's justified. The problem is that he reacted strongly without prior discussion. \n\nThe question is whether he's an asshole (AITA). The community often looks at whether actions were reasonable. If he didn't address his concerns before and just reacted in the moment, that's a problem. Also, calling her a psycho is harsh. \n\nBut if her answer was the final thing that made him realize they're incompatible, then maybe not. It's a tough call. The answer could go either way. However, in AITA scenarios, breaking up over something like that without prior communication is often seen as the person not being in the wrong if it's a dealbreaker for them. So maybe answer B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
