We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who broke up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop obsession is in the wrong. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the guy (18M) is in a serious relationship for over a month. His girlfriend (18F) is a huge fan of Jung Yong Hwa. He's tried to be understanding, even though he doesn't care for K-Pop. The issue came up when she said she would go to a concert in Korea even if he was in the hospital. He found that answer so unacceptable that he ended the relationship.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's consider the key points. He had tolerated her fangirling before\u2014tattoo, liking posts, etc. But this specific scenario was a dealbreaker for him. The statement about prioritizing a concert over his health seems to indicate a lack of commitment in his eyes. However, her answer was honest, and he called her a psycho. That's pretty harsh, but maybe it's his right if this is a red line for him.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe he overreacted. A month is a short time in a relationship. Her answer was straightforward, and perhaps he didn't communicate his feelings about this issue before. If he had talked about his concerns earlier, maybe the situation could have been resolved. But he only lashed out when this specific scenario came up.\n\nAlso, the question is about whether he's the asshole. In relationships, it's important to have open communication. If this was a big deal to him, maybe he should have addressed it earlier. However, her response might have been the final straw that showed her priorities were different. Breaking up because of differing priorities can be valid, but the way he reacted (calling her a psycho) might be seen as extreme.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often look at intent and actions. He tried to be understanding before, but this was a dealbreaker. Her answer was honest, and he chose to end the relationship. It's a tough call. Some might say he's in the wrong for ending it over something that's a personal choice, while others might say it's his right if it's affecting the relationship's foundation.\n\nBut the key here is that he didn't force her to lie. She was truthful, and he was hurt. However, breaking up over this might be a personal choice. Maybe the answer is that he's not in the wrong because he followed his feelings, even if the method was harsh. But the harsh words could be seen as inconsiderate. However, in the context of an AITA forum, the answer is usually B (not in the wrong) because he had to prioritize his own feelings and boundaries.\n"
