We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user wants to know if the person who broke up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop obsession is in the wrong. Let's see.\n\nFirst, the situation: They've been dating seriously for over a month. The guy isn't a huge K-Pop fan but tries to be attentive. The girl is super into Jung Yong Hwa, fangirling a lot. She's saving for a tattoo of his name. Then, when he hypothetically asks if she'd go to the concert even if he were in the hospital, she says she'd go without hesitation. He breaks up with her, thinking she's not committed. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, her dedication to a celebrity she hasn't met seems extreme. She's not just a fan; she's planning a trip to Korea for a concert and getting a tattoo. The guy felt this showed a lack of commitment when put to the test. But on the other hand, is it fair to break up over that? Especially since they've only been dating a month. Maybe he overreacted?\n\nHer response was to the hypothetical scenario. She didn't say she'd prioritize him over her health or anything. But the way she answered made him feel like her devotion to the idol was more important than their relationship. However, breaking up over a hypothetical might be rash. Also, considering they've been dating a short time, maybe it's too soon to make that kind of judgment. \n\nBut then, if her actions (like the tattoo and concert plans) are part of her identity, and he can't accept that, maybe ending the relationship was his way of dealing with the incompatibility. The key is whether her response was a dealbreaker. If he felt that her commitment to the idol over their relationship was unacceptable, he might not be in the wrong. However, using a hypothetical that's extreme (him being in the hospital) could be seen as a test, and maybe she didn't take it seriously because it's a hypothetical. \n\nAlso, the fact that she said she wouldn't lie suggests she was being honest, but maybe she didn't realize how much it would hurt him. The guy's reaction was immediate and severe. Could he have handled it better? Maybe. But the question is about being in the wrong. If he felt that her priorities were in conflict with their relationship, then acting on that isn't necessarily wrong. However, some might argue that he didn't communicate his feelings beforehand and just ended things upon her honest answer. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (No, he's not in the wrong) because he had the right to end the relationship if her priorities clashed with his. But others might think he overreacted since it was a hypothetical and they were only dating for a month. It's a tough call. But given the context, maybe B is the right answer here.\n"
