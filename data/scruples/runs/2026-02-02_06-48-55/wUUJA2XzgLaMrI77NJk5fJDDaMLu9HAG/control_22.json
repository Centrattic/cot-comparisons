We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who broke up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop fandom is in the wrong. The situation is that the girl is super into Jung Yong Hwa, the guy doesn't care for K-Pop, but has been tolerant. The breaking point was when she said she'd go to his concert in Korea even if he (the boyfriend) was in the hospital. The guy called her a psycho and broke up. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend's actions: she's a fan, which is common. She likes him a lot, talks about him, saves up for a tattoo, etc. But the issue here is her response to the hypothetical scenario. The key point is her answer to the hospital question.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction: he's hurt and breaks up. The question is whether that's justified.\n\nSo, in relationships, communication is key. The guy didn't like the attention she gave the K-Pop idol, but he hadn't addressed it before. Maybe he should have talked about his feelings instead of letting it build up. However, her response to the hypothetical situation where she's willing to ignore his hospitalization shows a lack of prioritization of their relationship. That's a big red flag. \n\nBut is breaking up over that appropriate? Well, if the guy felt that her commitment to the idol over him was a deal-breaker, then maybe not in the wrong. However, the way he reacted\u2014calling her a psycho\u2014is harsh. But the question is about whether he was in the wrong for breaking up, not the method.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the guy overreacted. Maybe the situation was a symptom of deeper issues, like not discussing his discomfort with her fandom earlier. But the specific incident was the trigger. \n\nIn terms of standards, in relationships, when one partner's interests affect the other's feelings, communication is essential. If the guy had talked about his feelings earlier, maybe they could have found a solution. But instead, he let it all go until this extreme scenario. \n\nHer response was definitely a problem. If she prioritizes a celebrity over her partner in a time of crisis, that's a sign of disloyalty. But maybe the guy could have handled it differently. However, the question is about whether he's the asshole for breaking up, not about his handling. \n\nThe answer likely hinges on whether the breaking point was justified. If the girl's actions showed she couldn't prioritize him, then the breakup isn't the guy's fault. However, if he should have worked on communication, maybe he is partially at fault. \n\nBut given the scenario, the girl's response was a dealbreaker for him. If that's the case, then the breakup isn't his fault. The key is whether the girl's behavior was unreasonable. Her being a fan is okay, but her response to the hypothetical shows she doesn't value the relationship over her fandom. That's a problem. The guy's reaction was harsh (calling her a psycho), but the question is about the breakup. So answer B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
