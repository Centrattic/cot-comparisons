We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop obsession. So, the situation is that the girlfriend is really into Jung Yong Hwa, a K-Pop artist. The author mentions that he's okay with her liking K-Pop, even the tattoo part. But the breaking point was when she said she wouldn't go to the concert even if he (the author) was in the hospital. The author then called her a psycho and broke up.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the context. The relationship is serious, over a month. The girl is into K-Pop, which the guy isn't, but he's been trying to pay attention. The main issue is her fangirling and the specific response about the hospital scenario. \n\nThe question is whether the author was wrong to break up. Let's think about what's acceptable in a relationship. People have different interests and passions. K-Pop fandoms can be intense, but is that a deal-breaker? The key here is the girl's response to the hypothetical situation. The author asked what if he was in the hospital, and she said she would still go. That's a significant commitment to her fandom over their relationship. \n\nBut wait, the author didn't take that well and broke up. Is that justified? The girl's actions (tattoo, saving for concert) show dedication to her passion. But when the author tests her loyalty, she's honest. The author might feel insecure or jealous because she's more into a virtual celebrity than him. \n\nHowever, breaking up because of this could be seen as a reaction to her honesty rather than the action itself. The girl might not have realized that her answer was hurtful. The author might have overreacted. On the other hand, if her commitment to K-Pop over their relationship is a deal-breaker, then maybe the breakup is justified. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether his reaction was disproportionate. Breaking up because of a hypothetical scenario where she wouldn't choose him over a concert might be too harsh, especially if the relationship is only a month old. However, if this was a red flag he couldn't accept, then it's his choice. \n\nAlso, the author tried to play along and then was shocked by her answer. The girl's honesty might not have been malicious. The author might need to communicate better instead of breaking up immediately. But if he felt that her priorities were misplaced, maybe he's not wrong. \n\nIn terms of general relationship advice, it's about mutual respect and communication. The author's action was abrupt, but if he couldn't accept her passion in a way that affects their relationship, then it's his right to end it. However, some might argue that his reaction was too extreme given the circumstances. \n\nSo, considering all angles, maybe the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because he didn't handle it well, but others might say B (not in the wrong) because he's ending a relationship for a deal-breaker. But the key is whether her actions were objectively wrong. The girl was honest, and the author's reaction was to break up immediately. It's possible he's the asshole for not discussing it and cutting off without giving her a chance to explain or for not handling it maturely. \n\nAlternatively, if her commitment to K-Pop is a deal-breaker for him, then he's not wrong. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong. The answer might hinge on whether his reaction was appropriate. Since he reacted with anger and cut off the relationship without addressing it, maybe he's in the wrong. But there's a case for both sides. \n\nI think the answer is A or B depending on perspective, but the majority view might be that the author is not in the wrong because he's setting a boundary, but others might say he's overreacting. However, in AITA scenarios, people often consider if the person overreacted. The answer might lean towards A because of the immediate breakup without discussion. Wait, but the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. If the girl's answer was a deal-breaker, then the author isn't wrong. But if the author didn't communicate his feelings beforehand, maybe he's responsible for the sudden breakup. \n\nHmm. The answer is probably B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's ending the relationship due to a red flag he couldn't accept. However, some might argue that his reaction was too hasty. But since the user is asking for a yes or no, and considering the hypothetical scenario where she prioritizes a celebrity over the relationship in principle, the author's decision to break up is justified. So, B.\n"
