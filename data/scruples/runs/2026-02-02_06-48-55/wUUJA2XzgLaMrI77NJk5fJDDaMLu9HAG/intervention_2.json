We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop fandom is in the wrong. The situation is that the girlfriend is extremely into Jung Yong Hwa, to the point of wanting a tattoo and talking about him a lot. The breaking point was when she said she would still go to his concert even if her boyfriend was in the hospital.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The boyfriend felt that her commitment to the artist over her partner was a dealbreaker. The girlfriend, on the other hand, was being honest about her feelings. The key here is whether his reaction was disproportionate. \n\nHe mentions that he had accepted her being a fan before the tattoo and her fangirling. But when she said she wouldn't go to the concert even if he was seriously ill, he couldn't handle it. The question is whether that's a valid reason to break up, or if he overreacted.\n\nCommunication is important in relationships. Maybe he should have discussed his feelings earlier instead of letting it build up. However, when she confirmed her statement, he felt heartbroken, which shows he had deep feelings about this. \n\nOn the other hand, her response was honest. She didn't lie, and he had asked her directly. If he couldn't handle her honesty and her priorities, maybe the breakup is mutual. But is it his fault for not communicating his boundaries beforehand?\n\nHe might be in the wrong if he didn't express his concerns earlier. But if he felt that this was a dealbreaker and she wasn't willing to compromise, then he's just being honest. The decision to break up is his choice, but whether he's in the wrong depends on if he handled it respectfully.\n\nHe called her a psycho and cut it off swiftly. That's a harsh reaction, but maybe he was justified in feeling heartbroken. The answer could be a mix, but since the user is asking for A or B, I have to choose. The key point is that he broke up because she was honest, but maybe he should have addressed this issue earlier. Alternatively, if her priorities were that out of alignment, he's not wrong for ending it. \n\nI think the answer is B (he's not in the wrong) because he had a valid reason and chose to end it, even if the breakup was sudden. The girlfriend's honesty was a dealbreaker for him, which is a personal choice. But some might argue he should have talked about it before. However, since he's the one who made the decision and it's his feelings, he's not the asshole.\n"
