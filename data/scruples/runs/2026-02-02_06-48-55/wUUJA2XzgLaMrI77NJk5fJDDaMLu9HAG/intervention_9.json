We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop fandom is in the wrong. The situation is about his girlfriend's extreme love for Jung Yong Hwa, a K-Pop artist. The key point is her response when he asked if she would still go to the concert if he (the boyfriend) was in the hospital.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. They've been dating for a month, which is not very long. The boyfriend mentions he's tried to be patient, even acknowledging her fangirling and the tattoo plans. But the breaking point was her serious answer to a hypothetical situation where she wouldn't prioritize him over the concert.\n\nHe asked, \"What if I was in the hospital?\" and she said she wouldn't lie, implying she would still go. That led him to call her a psycho and break up. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to confirm.\n\nI need to evaluate if breaking up over this was justified. The girlfriend's actions are extreme, but maybe the boyfriend overreacted. In a relationship, some level of compromise and understanding is necessary. The boyfriend's question seems to test her commitment, and her answer might not reflect real-life circumstances. However, her answer was a hypothetical scenario, and it's possible she was being honest without considering the emotional impact.\n\nThe boyfriend could have discussed his feelings before breaking up. Instead, he reacted impulsively by calling her names and ending the relationship immediately. That might be seen as harsh, especially since the issue was based on a hypothetical and not an actual event. The girlfriend's actions, while intense, don't necessarily indicate a lack of commitment in reality. She might not have meant to hurt him, but his response was extreme.\n\nOn the other hand, if he felt that her priorities were more important than their relationship, maybe he had a reason to break up. But the timing and the way he did it could be seen as the wrong approach. The key is whether the hypothetical question was a fair way to assess her commitment. Maybe there's a communication issue here. He might have needed to express his feelings earlier instead of waiting for a test scenario.\n\nIn conclusion, while the girlfriend's behavior is extreme, the boyfriend's reaction was likely too severe. He didn't give her a chance to explain or work through the issue. Breaking up based on a hypothetical scenario without further discussion could be considered the wrong move. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
