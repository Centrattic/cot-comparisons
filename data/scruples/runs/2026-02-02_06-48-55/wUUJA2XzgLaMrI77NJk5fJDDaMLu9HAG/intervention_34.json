We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop fandom. So the situation is that the guy is 18, the girl is 18 too. They've been dating for over a month. The issue is her extreme fangirling for Jung Yong Hwa, a K-Pop artist. The author mentions that he usually tries to be understanding, even though he doesn't care for K-Pop. But when she said she would still go to the concert even if he was in the hospital, he broke up with her.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the key points here. The girl is very into K-Pop, which he's not a fan of. He's okay with most of her actions like liking every post, saving for a tattoo, etc. But the breaking point was her statement about going to the concert even if he was in the hospital. He took that as a sign that she doesn't prioritize their relationship over her fandom. Then he called her a psycho and broke up. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know. I need to consider if breaking up over that statement is justified. Let's break it down. \n\nFirst, how long have they been dating? A month. That's not a long time, but some people do break up over significant issues even early on. The author was heartbroken, so maybe the issue was more about feeling unappreciated or replaced. The girl's response was very direct, not lying. That might have triggered him because he felt she didn't have his back in a hypothetical serious situation. But is it fair to break up over a hypothetical scenario? \n\nThe girl's statement might have been made in a joking context since they were playing along with scenarios. The author set up a ridiculous situation (him being in the hospital) and she answered honestly. Maybe she didn't mean it as a real scenario but was just going along with the game. If she was serious, then maybe there's an issue. But if it was just a hypothetical that she took a joke, then the author overreacted. \n\nAlso, the girl is 18, so still young. K-Pop can be a big part of some people's lives, especially for teens and young adults. Her fangirling might be seen as normal by her, but the author might find it excessive. But the breaking point was her hypothetical answer. \n\nThe author's reaction was to call her a psycho and cut it off. That's a strong reaction. Maybe he should have talked it out more before ending the relationship. Breaking up over one statement, even if it's a dealbreaker, might be abrupt. \n\nOn the other hand, if he felt that her priorities were not aligned with his, and that she didn't value their relationship enough, then breaking up might be his way of setting a boundary. But is that reasonable? It's possible that the scenario was taken out of context. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because he overreacted. The hypothetical situation might not reflect her real feelings. Also, breaking up over a joke scenario could be seen as not handling the situation maturely. The girl's answer was honest, but maybe she didn't mean it literally. The author's reaction was harsh. Alternatively, if the author truly felt that her commitment to someone she's never met was more important than him, then it's a valid issue. But since it was a hypothetical, it's hard to judge. \n\nI think the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because breaking up over a hypothetical scenario that might have been a joke shows immaturity. The author didn't give her a chance to explain further, just reacted emotionally. However, others might argue that if this was a dealbreaker for him, then he's not in the wrong. But the fact that he called her a psycho immediately suggests a lack of communication and understanding. So maybe A is the right answer here.\n"
