We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop obsession, specifically Jung Yong Hwa. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has been dating for over a month. The guy isn't into K-Pop, but he's tried to be supportive. The girlfriend is a big fan, fangirling a lot, saving for a tattoo of the artist's name, and liking all his social media posts. The breaking point was when she said she'd go to his concert in Korea even if the author was in the hospital. He found that answer so upsetting that he broke up with her.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The main issue here is whether her response was a deal-breaker or if the author overreacted. The girlfriend's commitment to her fandom, including the tattoo and the concert, might be seen as extreme, but she hasn't done anything illegal or necessarily abusive. However, when he presented a hypothetical where he's in the hospital, she said she'd still go. That suggests her loyalty to the idol over her partner in that scenario. \n\nBut wait, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. In relationships, communication and mutual respect are key. The author tried to be patient, but this situation tested his boundaries. If her response made him feel unimportant or less than the idol, it's valid for him to feel hurt. Breaking up because of a dealbreaker isn't necessarily the wrong thing to do, especially if he felt his needs weren't met. \n\nHowever, others might argue that her answer was taken out of context. Maybe she was just being playful or didn't realize how serious he was. But the post says he confirmed she was serious. In that case, her commitment to the idol over her partner in a hypothetical extreme scenario might be a legitimate reason for the breakup. \n\nOn the other hand, some might say that breaking up over this is too harsh, especially since it's a new relationship and they've been together for a month. But the author felt heartbroken and couldn't handle it. It's a personal choice, and if he couldn't accept her dedication to the idol in a way that prioritizes the idol over the relationship in a hypothetical, then leaving could be justified. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't clearly in the wrong. He had his reasons based on her priorities. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
