We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop obsession. The situation is that the girlfriend is extremely into a K-Pop artist, Jung Yong Hwa. The author says he's okay with her liking him, even the tattoo, but when she says she would go to the concert in Korea even if he were in the hospital, he breaks up with her.\n\nHmm. So, the key point here is the girlfriend's response. The author asked a hypothetical question about being in the hospital, and she said she would still go to the concert. The author found that heart-breaking and ended the relationship. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend's behavior: she's fangirling a lot, liking every post, saving for a tattoo. The author says he's okay with that, but the breaking point was the hypothetical scenario. It seems like her response indicated that her commitment to her K-Pop idol might override any personal relationship issues. The author might feel that in a serious relationship, his well-being being in the hospital isn't a priority for her, which is a big deal.\n\nBut wait, the hypothetical is just a hypothetical. He made up a scenario that's extreme and then based his decision on her answer. Maybe he's overreacting. Also, in a relationship, communication is key. Maybe the author should have discussed his feelings earlier instead of waiting until a hypothetical question. Also, the girlfriend might not have intended to hurt him, just answered honestly.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author was seriously sick, that's a real concern. But the situation is hypothetical. The girlfriend might not have considered how the question would affect him. Her answer was honest, but maybe she didn't realize the implications. However, the author could have handled it differently, maybe not breaking up immediately. Also, the author's reaction was cutting off the relationship swiftly. That might be a harsh response. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? He took the hypothetical answer as a sign of her priorities, but maybe he should have given her a chance to explain or talk about it more. By breaking up immediately, he didn't give her a chance to address the issue. Also, maybe their expectations about how much a relationship should affect each other's priorities weren't aligned. If the author couldn't accept her passion for K-Pop even in this hypothetical, maybe breaking up was his choice, but perhaps he's in the wrong for overreacting. Alternatively, if he felt that her answer showed she wouldn't prioritize him in a real crisis, maybe he's justified. But since it's a hypothetical, it's hard to know. \n\nThe answer depends on whether the hypothetical is a fair measure. The girlfriend might not take that scenario seriously, but the author did. However, relationships require compromise, and if the author couldn't handle her K-Pop passion, maybe ending the relationship wasn't wrong, but maybe he should have addressed it earlier. The user thinks he's in the wrong, but I'm not sure. The answer might be A or B. \n\nIn AITA threads, often the person who ends a relationship over a hypothetical without real context is seen as the asshole. Because the scenario is made up and the response is extreme. So maybe the author is the asshole for breaking up over a hypothetical answer. But if the answer represents a real issue in the relationship, maybe not. But since the hypothetical is extreme and not based on real events, the author might be overreacting. So, answer A.\n"
