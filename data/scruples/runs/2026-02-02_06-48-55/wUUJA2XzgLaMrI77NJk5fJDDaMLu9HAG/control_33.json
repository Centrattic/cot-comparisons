We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop obsession is in the wrong. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe guy is 18, and they've been dating seriously for over a month. The issue is her extreme fangirling over Jung Yong Hwa. He mentions that she's usually not very complimentary to him but is super enthusiastic about this K-Pop star. She likes every post of his on Instagram, saves up for a tattoo, and says she'd go to his concert in Korea even if she was in the hospital. The breaking point was when he asked what if he was in the hospital, and she said she'd still go. He then called her a psycho and ended things.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if he was wrong to break up. Relationships involve compromise. If one partner's interests are causing consistent discomfort, that's a red flag. But the key here is how intense her fangirling is. She's not just a fan; she's to the point of getting a tattoo and prioritizing him over her partner in hypothetical scenarios. The guy tried to be understanding but felt hurt when she didn't prioritize him in a serious situation. \n\nHe didn't just end it because she likes K-Pop; it was her response to a hypothetical where he's in the hospital. That's a test of loyalty and commitment. If she was serious about the relationship, her answer might have been a deal-breaker for him. On the other hand, is it fair to break up over a hypothetical? Maybe. But the issue isn't just the hypothetical. It's about the pattern of behavior where she's more invested in a celebrity she's never met than in her partner. \n\nAlso, the tattoo and saving money for the concert are significant commitments. If he's not comfortable with that level of dedication to a public figure over him, then it's a valid reason to end things. However, breaking up over one question might be abrupt. But considering the build-up, maybe not. \n\nIs he in the wrong? Well, he did confront her and she confirmed she was serious. Her answer made him feel heartbroken, leading to the breakup. He didn't have to react that strongly, but if he felt that her priorities were misplaced to that extent, ending the relationship isn't necessarily wrong. The alternative would be to address it early on, but maybe he tried to be patient. \n\nOn the other hand, she might feel he's being too controlling. However, the line between being a fan and prioritizing a fan over a partner can be a problem. So, considering all that, the answer might be B (No, he's not in the wrong) because he had legitimate reasons based on her commitment levels.\n"
