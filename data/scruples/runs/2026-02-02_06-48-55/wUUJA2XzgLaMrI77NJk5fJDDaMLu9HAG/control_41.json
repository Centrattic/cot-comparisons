We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop obsession, specifically Jung Yong Hwa. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The guy is 18, his girlfriend is also 18. They've been dating seriously for over a month. She's a huge fan of Jung Yong Hwa, to the point of fangirling constantly, liking every post, saving for a tattoo, and even saying she'd go to his concert in Korea even if he were in the hospital. The breaking point was when she said she wouldn't lie about going to the concert even if he was in the hospital. He called her a psycho and broke up. \n\nNow, I need to assess if he's in the wrong. Let's break down the key points. \n\nThe girlfriend's fangirling is extreme, but the guy says he's okay with most of it, including the tattoo. The final straw was her statement about not hesitating to go to the concert even if he were in the hospital. That's a hypothetical scenario where her partner's health is a critical issue, and her response shows a lack of empathy or consideration for his feelings. \n\nIn a relationship, mutual respect and consideration are important. If one partner is completely dismissive of the other's feelings in a serious situation, that can be a red flag. However, the guy's reaction was to call her a psycho and break up immediately. That's pretty harsh, especially if this was the first time she showed such indifference. But given that the scenario was a hypothetical, maybe she didn't realize how hurtful that was. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. He felt heartbroken and couldn't continue the relationship. On the other hand, she might have been unaware of how her words would be taken. However, her hypothetical answer suggests a lack of emotional investment in the relationship's future, which is a valid reason for someone to feel betrayed. \n\nBut is it fair for him to break up over a hypothetical question? Arguably, the breakup was a reaction to her lack of empathy in a crucial area. However, maybe he should have discussed it more calmly first. But the situation is that he felt heartbroken and decided to end it. \n\nIn AITA contexts, people are often called out for being too quick to anger or not giving the other side enough consideration. However, if her response indicated she wouldn't prioritize his wellbeing in a serious situation, that's a major concern. \n\nSo, the answer could go either way. But since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, the key is whether breaking up over a hypothetical conversation is justified. If the hypothetical was meant to test her feelings and she took it as a joke, maybe the guy overreacted. However, her response was completely serious, which he found heart-wrenching. \n\nIn many cases, people who break up over such things are not considered the asshole if they felt deeply hurt. However, the severity of the response (calling her a psycho) might be seen as harsh. So, maybe the author is not in the wrong because he acted on his feelings of being heartbroken, but the way he handled it (calling her names) might be part of the issue. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Given that he couldn't handle the hypothetical scenario and ended the relationship, maybe he's justified. Alternatively, if the hypothetical was just a test, then his reaction is excessive. \n\nI think in this case, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). He had his breaking point and decided to end the relationship. While calling her a psycho isn't nice, the breakup itself is a personal decision based on his feelings of betrayal or hurt. The AITA community often considers the person not the asshole if they felt deeply wronged, even if their reaction could be seen as harsh.\n"
