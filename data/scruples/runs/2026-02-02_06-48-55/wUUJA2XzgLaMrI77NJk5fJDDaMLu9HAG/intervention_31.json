We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop fan behavior. The scenario is that the guy is 18, their relationship has been serious for over a month. The girlfriend is a huge fan of Jung Yong Hwa, to the point of fangirling a lot, saving for a tattoo, and the breaking point was when she said she wouldn't go to his concert even if he (the boyfriend) was in the hospital.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The guy says he's okay with her being a fan, including the tattoo. The issue is her response to the hypothetical situation where he's in the hospital. She was completely serious in saying she would still go to the concert, which made him break up. He's asking if he's the asshole.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know if that's the case. So the question is whether the author is wrong for breaking up. The answer should be A (Yes) or B (No).\n\nI need to consider the dynamics here. The girlfriend's behavior is intense, but maybe not unreasonable. K-Pop fans can be very passionate. The key point is the response to the hypothetical scenario. The guy tested her by asking if she'd still go to the concert if he was in the hospital. She was serious in her answer, which he took as a deal-breaker.\n\nIs this a fair reason to break up? Maybe the guy overreacted. Relationships require communication and understanding. If he was concerned about her priorities, he should have addressed it before such a hypothetical situation. The question is whether the hypothetical is a valid test of commitment. Sometimes people use hypotheticals to push for a certain reaction, but if the person is being serious, it might indicate a lack of emotional availability or prioritization. However, in a young relationship (only a month), breaking up over such a scenario might be hasty. Also, the girlfriend's behavior might not necessarily indicate she's not committed; she just has a strong interest in K-Pop. The guy's reaction could be seen as not accepting her interests, even if they're intense. So maybe he's the asshole for not communicating his feelings before and for taking her hypothetical answer too harshly.\n\nBut some might argue that if he was truly heartbroken and couldn't accept that, he's justified. The problem is whether the reaction was proportional. Breaking up over a hypothetical and a real answer, especially after being okay with all the other behaviors, might be overreacting. So the answer could be A or B depending on the perspective.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers whether the person's actions were reasonable given the context. If the girlfriend didn't lie and was honest, maybe she's not wrong. The guy might have pushed too hard with a hypothetical that's not realistic, expecting a different answer. So he's the asshole for not handling it better and breaking up based on a hypothetical. So the answer would be A.\n"
