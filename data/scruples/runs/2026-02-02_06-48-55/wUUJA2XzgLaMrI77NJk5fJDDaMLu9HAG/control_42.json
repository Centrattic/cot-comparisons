We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who broke up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop obsession is in the wrong. So, first, I need to understand both sides here.\n\nThe guy is 18, and they've been dating seriously for over a month. He says he's okay with her fangirling over Jung Yong Hwa, even the tattoo. But when she says she'd go to the concert in Korea even if he was in the hospital, he breaks up with her. The key point here is her response to the hypothetical scenario. She didn't lie and said she'd still go, which made him heartbroken and led to the breakup.\n\nNow, considering the context, relationships often involve compromises and dealing with each other's interests. The guy tolerated her fangirling before, so why did this specific situation cross a line for him? Her answer to the extreme hypothetical might have triggered his feelings of being unimportant to her. But is that a valid reason to break up?\n\nThe question is whether he's the asshole. The user is asking if his reaction was justified. In AITA scenarios, people often debate what's reasonable. Here, he's reacting to a hypothetical that's pretty extreme. Her answer was honest but perhaps hurtful. He might have felt it showed her priorities were not aligned, especially since he had already been bothered by her constant fangirling. However, breaking up over a hypothetical situation might be seen as overreacting. On the other hand, if her answer confirmed his feelings that she didn't value their relationship over her obsession, maybe it's understandable.\n\nBut wait, the hypothetical is a made-up scenario. She's not actually going to the concert if he's in the hospital. It's a test of her loyalty. If he felt she didn't prioritize their relationship, then maybe he had been building up to this. However, using such an extreme hypothetical to test her might not be fair. People often use hypotheticals in arguments, and her answer was honest. If he was already feeling neglected, the breakup might be his way of addressing that. But is it right to end things over a hypothetical?\n\nIn AITA cases, the community considers if the person acted unreasonably. If he was okay with her K-Pop interest but felt this specific hypothetical showed her not valuing their relationship, maybe he's not the asshole. However, breaking up over a hypothetical might be seen as harsh. But since the question is about whether he's in the wrong, the answer depends on whether the situation was a deal-breaker for him. If her answer confirmed his feelings that she didn't prioritize their relationship, then maybe he's justified. But if he's overreacting to a hypothetical, then he might be the asshole.\n\nI think the key here is that he had been okay with her fangirling up until this point. The breaking point was her hypothetical answer. However, using a hypothetical to test her might not be a fair reason to break up. People have different boundaries, and if this was a deal-breaker for him, he might be justified. But the community might see it as him overreacting. Alternatively, if he felt it was a betrayal, maybe not. It's a bit of a toss-up. But given that the hypothetical is extreme and not an actual situation, and she had already been fangirling, some might argue he's in the wrong for breaking up over that. Others might say he's within his rights if that's a deal-breaker.\n"
