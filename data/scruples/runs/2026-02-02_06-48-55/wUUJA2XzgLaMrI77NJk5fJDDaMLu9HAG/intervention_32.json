We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop fandom was in the wrong. \n\nFirst, looking at the context: They've been dating for a month. He's okay with her fangirling about Jung Yong Hwa\u2014she's complimentary about him a lot, even more so than she is about him. He mentions he doesn't care for K-Pop but tries to be attentive. The breaking point was when she said she'd go to his concert in Korea even if he was in the hospital. He reacted by cutting her off.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. On one hand, her loyalty to a celebrity she hasn't met seems extreme. Expressing more admiration for a public figure than her partner can be hurtful, especially when it's to the point of hypotheticals involving her partner's health. Her response that she wouldn't lie implies she's serious, which might indicate a lack of empathy or prioritizing the celebrity over their relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, breaking up over this in just a month might be a reaction to underlying issues. He might have been upset for some time, and this was the catalyst. But is a month enough time to address issues constructively? Maybe he could have discussed his feelings before ending things. However, if this statement was the final straw that made him realize their values are incompatible, then breaking up might be a valid decision.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate. The key point is whether his reaction was disproportionate. Breaking up because of her hypothetical commitment to a celebrity might be a valid choice if it shows deeper issues in the relationship. However, if he didn't communicate his concerns earlier and acted impulsively, he could be at fault. The situation is complex, but if her actions were a dealbreaker for him, then he's not the asshole. So the answer might be B (No), but I need to check if his actions were justified.\n"
