We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop obsession. The situation involves the girlfriend being very enthusiastic about Jung Yong Hwa, to the point of fangirling constantly and even planning a concert trip to Korea. The breaking point was when she said she would go to the concert even if he (the author) was in the hospital. He then called her a psycho and ended the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author felt hurt and betrayed because her response indicated she valued her K-Pop idol over their relationship. The girlfriend's actions, while extreme, might not be malicious. She was honest about her feelings, which he didn't expect. The key question is whether the author's reaction was justified.\n\nThe author mentions he was okay with her love for K-Pop, including the tattoo. But when she stated she would go to the concert even if he was in the hospital, he felt heartbroken. That statement likely felt like a lack of loyalty or consideration. However, breaking up immediately after that might be a hasty decision.\n\nOn one hand, the girlfriend's honesty could be seen as her being true to herself, even if it was painful. On the other hand, the author had the right to feel disrespected if he felt her priorities were misplaced. The problem is whether the breakup was the appropriate response to her honesty about her feelings.\n\nSome might argue that the author didn't address his concerns constructively. He could have discussed his feelings instead of reacting impulsively. Others might say that if her devotion to a stranger was causing him emotional distress, ending the relationship was valid. It's a gray area, but the key is whether the author acted inconsiderately or if his feelings were valid.\n\nIn summary, while the author's reaction was intense, if his feelings were genuinely hurt and he couldn't reconcile this difference, he might not be the asshole. However, the question is whether he had a right to break up over something he previously tolerated. The answer might hinge on whether the statement was a deal-breaker or a sudden overreaction.\n"
