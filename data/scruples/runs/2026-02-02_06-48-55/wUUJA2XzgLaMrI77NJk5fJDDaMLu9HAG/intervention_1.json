We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong.\n\nSo the situation is that the guy broke up with his girlfriend over her extreme love for K-Pop, specifically Jung Yong Hwa. They've been dating for over a month. The main issue here is that when he asked her a hypothetical question about going to the concert even if he was in the hospital, she said she would go. He found that heart-wrenching and broke up with her.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the dynamics of their relationship. They've been dating for a month, which is relatively short. The guy mentions that he's tried to be understanding, even okay with the tattoo. But the breaking point was her hypothetical answer to his question. \n\nNow, the key point here is whether her response was unreasonable. The guy asked a hypothetical scenario where he's seriously ill, and she said she would still go to the concert. He felt this showed a lack of commitment to him, leading to the breakup. \n\nBut wait, how reasonable is it to expect a commitment from a month-long relationship? The guy might have expected a lot given the breakup decision, but maybe they were still in the early stages where such expectations might be too high. Also, she might not have meant it literally, or she could have been taken aback by his question. \n\nHer reaction was to say she wouldn't lie, which implies she was being honest. But in a relationship, especially a new one, communication is key. The guy could have been more open about his feelings instead of confronting her with a hypothetical that's emotionally charged. \n\nHe admitted he \"lashed out\" and called her a psycho. That's pretty harsh, especially if he was heartbroken. Breaking up over a hypothetical scenario that didn't happen in real life might be overreacting. Also, the fact that she's into K-Pop isn't a dealbreaker on its own. His main issue was her response, which he took as a sign of her prioritizing the fan aspect over their relationship. However, given the short time they were together, maybe he's jumping to conclusions. \n\nOn the other hand, she did say she would go even if he was in the hospital. That could be perceived as not valuing the relationship as much as he does. But again, in a month-long relationship, maybe he's expecting too much. Also, the hypothetical scenario is extreme and might not reflect her real feelings in a real situation. \n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. If he broke up over a hypothetical that didn't actually happen, maybe he's overreacting. But if her answer genuinely hurt him and made him realize they're incompatible, then maybe not. The user thinks he's in the wrong, but I need to consider both sides. \n\nAlso, the way he reacted (calling her a psycho and cutting off the relationship) might be abrupt. There could have been a better way to address it. Maybe he should have talked to her more before breaking up. However, if this was the last straw after building up issues, then maybe it's justified. \n\nBut considering the time they've been together and the nature of the hypothetical question, the guy might be the asshole here for breaking up over something that's a hypothetical and perhaps overreacting. Her response was honest, even if it hurt him. So maybe the answer is A (he is in the wrong). But I need to check if there's more to it. \n\nAlternatively, if her statements about the concert show a lack of commitment to their relationship, then he's justified. But given the short time frame, it's possible he's making a hasty decision. \n\nHmm. It's a tough one. The user thinks he's in the wrong, but I need to decide based on the situation. The main points are the hypothetical scenario, her answer, and his reaction. If her answer was a dealbreaker for him, maybe he's not wrong. But if he's overreacting to a hypothetical, then he's the asshole.\n"
