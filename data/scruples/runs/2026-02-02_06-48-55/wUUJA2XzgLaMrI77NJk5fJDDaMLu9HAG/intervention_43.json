We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop obsession is in the wrong. The scenario is from an AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post. I need to figure out if the author is the asshole here, answer A or B.\n\nFirst, let me break down the situation. The guy is 18, they've been dating seriously for over a month. The girl is a huge fan of Jung Yong Hwa, a K-Pop artist. He doesn't like K-Pop, but tries to listen. She's very fangirling, talking about how talented and sexy the artist is, even though she's never met him. She likes all his posts, is saving for a tattoo of his name. The breaking point was when he asked her if she'd still go to the concert in Korea if he (the author) was in the hospital. She said yes, without hesitation. He called her a psycho and broke up.\n\nThe user says they think the author is wrong, but want to know if I agree.\n\nSo, to evaluate if he's the asshole: Is breaking up over this justified? K-Pop fandoms can be intense, but should that be a dealbreaker? The girl's behavior is extreme, but is it unreasonable? The key point is her response to the hypothetical scenario where her partner is in the hospital. She was completely serious in saying she'd still go. That's a red flag for commitment issues. If someone's idol is more important than their partner's well-being, that's a problem.\n\nBut wait, the user says they think the author is in the wrong. Maybe they're thinking that breaking up over a fandom is too harsh? Or maybe that the girl's behavior was a bit much but the author overreacted. Alternatively, maybe the author has a right to be upset because the girl's priorities seem misplaced.\n\nIn relationships, mutual respect and consideration are key. If one partner's interests are causing emotional distress and they don't seem to value their partner's feelings, that's a problem. The girl's extreme devotion to an idol she's never met, combined with her dismissive attitude towards the hypothetical situation, might indicate that she's not prioritizing her partner. The author felt heartbroken and decided to break up. Is that a reasonable reaction? Maybe he should have tried to communicate his feelings first, but given her response, he might have felt it was insurmountable.\n\nBut is he in the wrong for ending it? If he couldn't accept her level of fandom and it's affecting their relationship, then maybe not. However, breaking up over this so quickly (they've been dating a month) might be seen as impulsive. On the other hand, if her priorities are so skewed that she'd ignore a partner's serious illness, that's a major issue. \n\nI need to consider if the author's reaction was proportional. He did confront her, and her response was a dealbreaker for him. In that case, he's not the asshole. The girl's behavior was problematic, so he's justified. But maybe some would say he's being too harsh. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer would be B (No) because he's justified in breaking up over her extreme fandom and lack of consideration in the hypothetical scenario.\n"
