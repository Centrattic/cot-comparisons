We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who broke up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop obsession is in the wrong. The situation is that he's 18, they've been dating seriously for over a month. She's really into Jung Yong Hwa, to the point of fangirling a lot, liking all his social media posts, and planning a tattoo. But what made him break up was when she said she would still go to the concert even if he was in the hospital.\n\nSo first, I need to consider both sides. The guy felt that her commitment to her idol outweighs her commitment to their relationship. The girl's response was that she wouldn't lie, meaning she would go even if he was seriously ill. That must have hurt him a lot, leading to the breakup.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. On one hand, breaking up over this seems extreme, especially since the girl's K-Pop love has been a thing for a while and he's been okay with it before. Maybe he had some unresolved feelings about her obsession but hadn't communicated it properly. The trigger was the hospital comment, which might have been the last straw because it showed a lack of prioritization in her part.\n\nOn the other hand, the girl's response was honest, which is important in a relationship. If she had lied, that might have been worse. But her answer indicated that her dedication to the idol is so strong that she would leave him in the hospital. That's a serious red flag for commitment in a relationship. The guy might feel that he can't be in a relationship where the partner values a distant celebrity more than their partner's well-being.\n\nBut wait, the relationship is only a month old. Maybe he didn't give it enough time, or maybe he projected his expectations too quickly. Also, the girl's response could be seen as a hypothetical overreaction, and maybe she didn't mean it literally. However, she was clear she wouldn't lie, so he had to take it as her true feelings.\n\nAnother angle: The guy's reaction was immediate and harsh. Calling her a psycho and cutting off the relationship might be too abrupt, even if hurt. However, if this was a dealbreaker for him, then it's his right to end the relationship. Relationships require mutual respect and compatibility. If he can't accept her devotion to a celebrity over their relationship, then they may not be compatible.\n\nBut is it right to break up over this? Maybe he should have talked to her more about his feelings instead of reacting with anger. However, the situation might have been a clear sign that they have conflicting priorities. The key here is whether the girl's actions crossed a line that's unacceptable in a relationship. If she's willing to abandon her partner in a crisis for a concert, that's a major issue.\n\nIn conclusion, the guy's reaction might be justified if he felt that her priorities were incompatible. However, the way he handled it (calling her a psycho) could be seen as harsh. But given the context, breaking up might be his right if this was a dealbreaker. So the answer might be B (he's not in the wrong). But some might argue he didn't handle it maturely. Hmm.\n"
