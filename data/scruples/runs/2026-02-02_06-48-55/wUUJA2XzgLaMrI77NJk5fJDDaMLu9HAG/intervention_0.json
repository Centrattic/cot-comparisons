We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop fandom. The key points from the scenario are:\n\nThe girlfriend is 18, and they've been dating seriously for over a month. She's a big fan of Jung Yong Hwa, to the point of being a super fan. She likes his music, fangirls over him, and wants to get a tattoo of his name. She also mentioned she would go to his concert in Korea even if her partner was in the hospital. The author felt this was a deal-breaker and broke up with her.\n\nFirst, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. But the question is whether the author is wrong. So I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the girlfriend's actions might seem extreme. She's saving money for a tattoo, fangirling intensely, and even saying she wouldn't cancel the concert even if her partner was in the hospital. That's a significant commitment to a celebrity, which the author didn't take into account when they started the relationship. The author might feel that this level of devotion isn't compatible with their relationship, especially since he's not into K-Pop at all.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's reaction was immediate and final. He called her a psycho and ended the relationship. The breakup happened after a single conversation where he tested her commitment by asking a hypothetical. The question is whether this was a fair way to end things. The author didn't try to discuss it further or express his feelings earlier. He let it build up until this moment, then reacted harshly. \n\nAlso, considering they've only been dating a month, maybe it's too soon to make such a judgment. But the author might see this as a fundamental issue in their compatibility. However, breaking up over a hypothetical scenario (even if it's important) might be extreme. It's possible that the author didn't communicate his concerns earlier, leading to an abrupt decision.\n\nAnother angle: The girlfriend's answer was honest, which the author found heart-breaking. But she was being truthful. If the author didn't like that, maybe he should have addressed it before testing her. Her willingness to go to the concert despite a hypothetical crisis might show that her passion is more important than her relationship, which could be a red flag for the author. But is that a valid reason to break up immediately?\n\nIn relationships, dealing with differing interests and commitments is part of the process. However, this seems like a deal-breaker for the author. But the way he handled it\u2014calling her a psycho and cutting things off\u2014might be seen as harsh, especially after only a month. The girlfriend wasn't forced to lie, which is part of honesty, but the author's reaction was extreme.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a toss-up. If the author felt this was a deal-breaker, he has the right to end the relationship. But the way he did it\u2014without prior discussion and with a strong emotional response\u2014might make him seem the asshole. Alternatively, if he felt deeply hurt and that his partner's priorities were misplaced, he might not be wrong. However, given the short duration and the immediate reaction, maybe he is the asshole for not handling it more maturely. The answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he didn't communicate his feelings earlier and reacted impulsively. But some might argue B (No) because he had valid concerns. But the consensus in similar situations often leans towards the person breaking up over a deal-breaker not being the asshole, especially if they communicated it. However, the method here was abrupt and harsh, which could make him the asshole.\n"
