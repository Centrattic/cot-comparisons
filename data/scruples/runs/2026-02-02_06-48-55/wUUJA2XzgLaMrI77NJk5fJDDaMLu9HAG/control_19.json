We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who broke up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop obsession) is the asshole. The question is whether he's in the wrong, with options A and B.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has been dating seriously for over a month. The girlfriend is a huge fan of Jung Yong Hwa, a K-Pop artist. The guy isn't a fan of K-Pop but tries to be supportive. The problem arises when she says she'd still go to the concert in Korea even if he were in the hospital. He takes this seriously, gets heartbroken, and breaks up with her. Now people are debating if he's the asshole.\n\nSo, what's the key here? The main issue seems to be the girlfriend's response to the hypothetical scenario. She's completely serious about going to the concert even if he's in the hospital. The guy interprets this as her not caring about him as a partner, leading to the breakup.\n\nNow, I need to consider both perspectives. The guy might feel that her commitment to a celebrity outweighs her commitment to the relationship. On the other hand, the girlfriend's behavior might be seen as excessive fangirling, but is her answer really the problem here?\n\nCultural context matters. K-Pop fandoms can be intense, and some people take their admiration seriously. However, in a relationship, expecting a partner to prioritize the relationship over a celebrity's event is a reasonable expectation. The girlfriend's response might indicate that she doesn't see the relationship as a priority in that scenario.\n\nBut wait, the scenario is hypothetical. The guy presented an extreme situation (him in the hospital) and the girlfriend answered honestly. Maybe he's overreacting because he feels his well-being is being ignored. However, he should realize that hypothetical questions can sometimes be taken too literally or emotionally. If the girlfriend was genuinely fangirling without considering the relationship's dynamics, that's an issue. But if the guy is using this as a litmus test for her commitment, perhaps he's being too harsh.\n\nAnother angle: relationships require compromise. If the guy can't accept her fangirling as part of her personality, maybe the breakup is a result of incompatibility. However, breaking up over a hypothetical situation might be premature. The time they were together is a month, which isn't a long time. Maybe he's not fully understanding her passion yet.\n\nAlso, the tattoo and saving money for the concert might be seen as excessive. But the user mentions he's okay with those. The breaking point was her not lying about the hypothetical. So, his main issue is her prioritization in that scenario.\n\nIs the guy in the wrong? If he made a hypothetical test and then broke up because she answered honestly, he might be the asshole. Relationships need trust and communication. If he had concerns, maybe he should have discussed them instead of using a hypothetical to provoke a reaction. Her honest answer might not be a deal-breaker, but his reaction to it could be.\n\nAlternatively, if he felt that her answer showed she doesn't value their relationship, then it's a valid reason to break up. But using a hypothetical where he's in a hospital is an extreme case. Maybe he's not respecting her as an individual with her own interests, leading to the breakup. In that case, he's not in the wrong if he can't accept her priorities.\n\nBut the line between being a fan and being overly obsessed is thin. If her behavior is affecting the relationship, then it's a problem. However, in this case, the problem is her hypothetical answer, not her actual actions up to that point. The user says he's okay with the tattoo and concerts. The issue is her response to a hypothetical scenario. So, perhaps he's overreacting. Breaking up over a hypothetical scenario might be hasty. Real-life actions matter more than hypotheticals.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's reaction to a hypothetical situation might make him the asshole if he's not giving the relationship a chance to work through real issues. But if he truly felt that her answer showed a lack of commitment, then maybe he's justified. It's a bit of a grey area, but leaning towards him not being in the wrong because the scenario is extreme and hypothetical. However, using such a scenario to break up might be unfair. Wait, but the question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's the one who broke up because of her answer, maybe he's not in the wrong if he can't accept her priorities. But if the hypothetical is too extreme, then maybe he's being unreasonable. Hmm. This is tricky. I think the answer is B, he's not in the wrong, because his breaking point was her not valuing him in a hypothetical scenario, which is a deal-breaker for him. But others might argue that he's overreacting. Given the options, the answer is B.\n"
