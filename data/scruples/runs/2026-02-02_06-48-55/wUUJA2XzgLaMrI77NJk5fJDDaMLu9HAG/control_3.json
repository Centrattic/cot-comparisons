We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop fandom is in the wrong. The situation is that the girlfriend is extremely into Jung Yong Hwa, a K-Pop idol. She's a fan, likes his music, follows him on social media, and even wants a tattoo of his name. The user says he's okay with all that. The breaking point was when the girlfriend said she would go to the concert in Korea even if he were in the hospital. The user found that answer so hurtful that he ended the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user mentions that he's been in a serious relationship for over a month. He tried to be understanding of her fangirling, even though he doesn't care for K-Pop. The issue arises when her commitment to the idol's concert overrides her commitment to the relationship, especially in a hypothetical scenario involving the user's health. \n\nNow, is the user in the wrong? Well, ending a relationship is a big step. The question is whether his reaction was justified. He might feel that her priorities are misplaced, valuing the idol more than their relationship. However, it's also important to note that the girlfriend's response was direct and honest. She didn't lie when asked if she'd still go to the concert even if he were hospitalized. People might have different thresholds for what they find unacceptable in a relationship. \n\nFrom a perspective of respect and communication, maybe the user should have addressed his concerns earlier. However, if her actions and priorities were causing him emotional distress, then breaking up might be his way of protecting himself. On the other hand, some might argue that one response, even if harsh, doesn't necessarily justify ending a month-old serious relationship. \n\nThe key here is whether the girlfriend's actions were indicative of a larger issue or just a momentary answer. Without more context, like a pattern of neglect or disrespect, it's hard to say. But the user felt deeply hurt and decided to end things, which is a personal choice. \n\nIn the AITA (Am I the Asshole) context, people often weigh both sides. The user might not be in the wrong because he had a valid reason to feel disrespected. The girlfriend was honest, and the user chose to leave. On the flip side, maybe the user overreacted. But given that the question is whether he's in the wrong, and the situation is about his personal boundaries, it's plausible he's justified. So, the answer might be B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
