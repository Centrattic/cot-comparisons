We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. So the user is asking whether the person who broke up with his girlfriend over her K-pop fandom is in the wrong. The situation is that the girlfriend is really into K-pop, specifically Jung Yong Hwa, and he's okay with a lot of that stuff, even the tattoo. But when she said she'd go to the concert in Korea even if he was in the hospital, he broke up with her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The boyfriend didn't like her fangirling, but he was trying to be understanding. The breaking point was her statement about going to the concert despite his being in the hospital. That seems like a big deal because it suggests she prioritizes the idol over her partner in a crisis.\n\nBut wait, maybe he overreacted. The question is whether he was in the wrong. He's 18, and the relationship is only a month old. Maybe a month is too short for such a serious issue to come up. But the user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong. \n\nOn one hand, he had a valid concern about where her loyalties lie in a dire situation. If someone says they'd leave their partner in the hospital to go to a concert, that's a red flag. But on the other hand, the situation is hypothetical and extreme. Maybe she was just being dramatic, and he took it too seriously. Also, their relationship was short, so maybe he didn't give it enough time. However, the fact that she's saving for a tattoo and likes every post online shows a deep commitment to the idol, which might have been a recurring issue.\n\nThe key point is whether breaking up over a hypothetical situation is justified. If he felt that her actions and priorities were incompatible with a healthy relationship, then maybe he's not in the wrong. But if he reacted impulsively without considering other perspectives, maybe he is. The answer hinges on whether the response was proportionate. Since the question is about being the asshole, the community often looks at intent and impact. His intent was to test her commitment, and her response made him realize a deal-breaker. But ending the relationship immediately after might be seen as harsh. However, if it's a deal-breaker for him, he's not wrong to leave. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). Because if her response made him realize that her priorities were not aligned with his, then leaving was a valid decision. Though it's a tough call, especially given the short time, but the context of her ongoing behavior plus the hypothetical scenario could be a legitimate reason.\n"
