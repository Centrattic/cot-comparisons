We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong after breaking up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop obsession. The main issue here is the girlfriend's extreme fangirling, especially towards Jung Yong Hwa. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They've been dating for over a month, which isn't a very long time. The guy says he's okay with most of her fangirling\u2014liking the artist, saving for a tattoo, etc.\u2014but the breaking point was when she said she would go to the concert in Korea even if he was in the hospital seriously ill. The guy found that commitment problematic and ended the relationship.\n\nI should think about whether his reaction was justified. The key point here is the level of commitment and where the line is drawn. The girlfriend's response was that nothing would keep her from the concert, even in such a serious situation. That could be seen as not prioritizing the relationship, especially in a crisis. However, it's also important to note that K-Pop fandoms can be very passionate, and people might have strong emotional connections to their idols.\n\nBut the guy's reaction was to call her a \"psycho\" and end the relationship. Was that too harsh? Breaking up over this might be extreme, especially if it was the first time she said something like that. Also, considering they've been dating for a month, maybe they didn't have enough time to work through such differences. However, if this was a recurring issue and he felt it was a deal-breaker, then maybe it's not entirely his fault. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might not have realized the gravity of her statement. She could have been joking or not considering his feelings. The guy might have felt that her commitment to the idol was more important than their relationship in a critical situation. \n\nBut the question is whether the author (the guy) is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether his reaction was proportionate. If he couldn't handle her intense fangirling to that extent and it's a deal-breaker, then maybe he's not wrong. However, if he didn't communicate his feelings first and just reacted strongly without trying to resolve it, that could be his fault. \n\nIn AITA cases, the community often looks at whether the person acted inconsiderately or without giving the other a chance to explain. The guy asked a hypothetical question, and when she answered honestly, he ended it immediately. That might be seen as not discussing the issue but rather reacting impulsively. \n\nSo, maybe the guy is in the wrong because he didn't try to address the issue constructively, and breaking up over a hypothetical scenario could be too hasty. On the other hand, if her actions were consistently making him feel insecure or neglected, then his reaction might be justified. The text says he was okay with the tattoo and other things, so the specific incident was the breaking point. \n\nI think the answer is A (he is in the wrong) because he didn't communicate his concerns earlier and ended the relationship abruptly based on a single statement. However, others might argue that if this was a deal-breaker, he had the right to end it. But typically, in such posts, the person who ends things over a single, even if serious, statement without prior discussion is often seen as the asshole. So I'm leaning towards A.\n"
