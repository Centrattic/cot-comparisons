We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with their girlfriend over her K-Pop fandom is in the wrong. Let's see the details.\n\nSo, the situation is that the guy (18M) broke up with his girlfriend (18F) after she said she'd go to Jung Yong Hwa's concert in Korea even if he was in the hospital. He's upset that she's so fangirling over this K-Pop star, even though he's tried to be understanding. She's saving up for a tattoo of his name, liking all his Instagram posts, etc. But the breaking point was her statement about going to the concert regardless of his health.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the guy's reaction is justified. He's been trying to be patient, but maybe there was a pattern of behavior that made him feel neglected or unimportant. The key moment is when she says she wouldn't lie about going even if he was in the hospital. That seems like a major deal-breaker. Commitment in a relationship involves considering each other's well-being. If she's willing to prioritize a concert over his health, that's a red flag.\n\nBut wait, maybe she was just being overly dramatic or didn't realize the weight of his question. Sometimes people in fandoms can get really into it without realizing how it affects their partners. However, her response was completely dismissive, not showing any empathy. If someone is in the hospital, that's a serious situation. Her answer suggests that her commitment to the fandom outweighs her partner's needs. That's probably a deal-breaker for the guy.\n\nOn the other hand, is it wrong for him to break up over this? If he had talked to her about his feelings before, maybe there's a chance to address the issue. But he says he's tried to be understanding, and this was the breaking point. The question is whether breaking up immediately after this incident was wrong. Since relationships require mutual respect and consideration, her response likely crossed a line. If he felt that her actions showed she didn't prioritize his feelings, ending the relationship might be justified.\n\nAlso, considering their age (18), they might still be learning about communication in relationships. Maybe the guy could have handled it with more patience or discussed his concerns earlier. However, the final answer depends on whether her behavior was indeed disrespectful or if he overreacted. Given that she was completely serious about going despite his illness, which is a significant commitment issue, the guy's decision to break up could be seen as justified. So the answer might be B (he's not in the wrong).\n"
