We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this scenario is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop obsession.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The guy is 18, and they've been dating seriously for over a month. He's not into K-Pop, but he tries to be supportive. His girlfriend is really into Jung Yong Hwa, fangirling a lot, talking about him constantly. She likes every Instagram post, is saving for a tattoo, and wants to go to a concert in Korea. The breaking point is when she says she wouldn't go to the concert even if he was in the hospital. He's heartbroken and breaks up with her, calling her a psycho.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's the asshole (A) or not (B). \n\nThe key points here are the girlfriend's behavior and the guy's reaction. The girlfriend is extremely devoted to a K-Pop artist she hasn't met, which he's okay with except for the part where she wouldn't prioritize him over her obsession. When he tests her, she's unflinching in her commitment to attending the concert even if he's in the hospital. He can't handle that and ends the relationship.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, communication is crucial. If he felt uncomfortable with her level of devotion and how it compared to her feelings for him, he should have addressed it earlier. Instead, he waited until this scenario came up. His reaction of calling her a psycho and breaking up might be seen as extreme. However, if her actions made him feel insecure or unimportant, that's a valid emotional response.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's dedication might not be unreasonable, but the fact that she didn't consider his feelings in that hypothetical situation is problematic. Love usually requires considering each other's feelings. Her being completely serious about not going to the concert even if he's in the hospital suggests a lack of empathy or prioritization of the relationship.\n\nSo, who's at fault? The guy's reaction was abrupt, but he had valid feelings. The girlfriend's response was hurtful. In relationships, both parties have responsibilities. The guy might have overreacted, but he's also justified in feeling neglected. However, breaking up over this, especially after a month, might be hasty. But given that this was a dealbreaker for him, it's his right to end the relationship. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. The answer depends on how we view the circumstances. If he communicated his feelings properly and this was the final straw, then maybe not. But if he didn't address the previous behaviors and just reacted strongly to this one incident, he might share some responsibility. However, the scenario says he tried to be understanding, so maybe it's more about her not respecting his feelings. \n\nOverall, breaking up because of this might be justified if he felt it was a dealbreaker. So the answer is B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
