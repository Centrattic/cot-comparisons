We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop obsession. The situation is that the girlfriend is really into K-Pop, especially Jung Yong Hwa. The author tried to be understanding, even okay with the tattoo. But when he asked if she'd go to the concert even if he was in the hospital, she said she'd still go. He broke up with her because of that.\n\nHmm, so the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know what I think. I need to evaluate both sides. First, the girlfriend's actions: she's a big fan, likes the artist a lot, and was saving for a concert. But when the hypothetical situation came up where her boyfriend was seriously ill, she didn't hesitate to say she'd still go. That's where the author felt it was a dealbreaker.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he might feel that her priorities are misplaced. If her commitment to a fan interest outweighs her commitment to a romantic partner, that could be a red flag. But maybe he overreacted. The question is whether his reaction was justified. Breaking up over one hypothetical answer seems harsh, especially if she's usually fangirling but he was okay with it before.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might not have realized the hypothetical question was serious. She might have been answering it as a fan, not considering how it would affect the author. But she was completely serious, which could indicate that her devotion is more important to her than their relationship. \n\nThe key points here are about boundaries and communication. The author might have should have addressed his concerns earlier if this was a dealbreaker. By bringing up a hypothetical scenario, he might have been testing her commitment, which isn't healthy. However, her response did show a lack of empathy or consideration for his feelings, which is a big issue in a relationship. \n\nSo, who is in the wrong? If the author broke up because he couldn't handle her priorities, but didn't communicate his needs before, maybe he's at fault. But if her response indicated that her fan devotion is more important than their relationship, then he might be justified. It's a tough call. However, breaking up over a hypothetical might be impulsive. The author could have handled it by discussing his feelings instead of reacting immediately. But her answer did show a lack of consideration, which is also a problem. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's reaction was proportionate. He was okay with her K-Pop love before, but this specific answer was the breaking point. Maybe he should have talked to her about his feelings rather than breaking up immediately. But her answer did show a lack of empathy. Still, maybe both parties have some responsibility here. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If he's the one who broke up, maybe he's not in the wrong because he felt his needs weren't met, but if he didn't communicate properly, that's an issue. Alternatively, she might have been inconsiderate. \n\nIn these kinds of situations, it's often about mutual respect and communication. If the author felt this was a dealbreaker, he might have been right to break up, but perhaps he could have handled it better. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. Given that he broke up and the situation, I'm leaning towards saying he's not in the wrong because her answer did show a lack of consideration for his feelings, but maybe he should have approached it differently. However, in the context of the scenario, breaking up over that might be a valid choice. So, maybe the answer is B (No, he's not in the wrong). But I'm not 100% sure. Another angle: the girlfriend's response could be seen as extreme, so the author acting on his feelings is justified. So B.\n"
