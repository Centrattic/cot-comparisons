We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about breaking up with a girlfriend because she's extremely into K-Pop, specifically Jung Yong Hwa.\n\nSo the guy is 18, they've been dating seriously for over a month. He mentions he's tried to be supportive of her fangirling but it's bothering him. Her issue is that she's overly complimentary about the artist compared to him. Then the breaking point is when he asks what if he was in the hospital, and she says she still wouldn't go. He breaks up with her, calling her a psycho.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the factors. The key points here are the girlfriend's behavior and the guy's reaction. The guy says he's been okay with most of her actions, even the tattoo. The problem is her response to the hypothetical situation where he's in the hospital. The question is whether his reaction is justified.\n\nThe girlfriend's answer implies that her commitment to her fandom is such that even in a serious situation involving her partner, she wouldn't prioritize him. That could be a deal-breaker for someone who values being the priority in the relationship. However, whether he's in the wrong depends on if his reaction was excessive.\n\nBreaking up over a hypothetical question might be seen as overreacting. However, if the girlfriend's behavior consistently showed that her commitment to the artist was more important than him, then maybe it's understandable. But the situation is a single question and answer. The guy's response was immediate and severe\u2014calling her a psycho and ending things. That's pretty harsh, even if he felt hurt.\n\nSo, considering both sides: he might have valid concerns about her prioritizing her fandom over their relationship. But the way he handled it\u2014calling her a psycho and breaking up abruptly\u2014could be seen as the asshole move. On the other hand, if her answer truly showed a lack of consideration for his feelings, then maybe he's justified. However, given the context, it's more likely that he's in the wrong because of the abrupt and harsh response, especially considering the relationship is only a month old. People can have different boundaries, but breaking up over a hypothetical might not be fair. So the answer would be A (he is in the wrong).\n"
