We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who broke up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop obsession was in the wrong. So, first, I need to analyze the situation from both sides.\n\nThe guy is 18, and they've been dating seriously for over a month. He says he doesn't care for K-Pop but tries to be attentive. The main issue is her fangirling, especially over Jung Yong Hwa. She's really into him: liking every Instagram post, saving for a tattoo, etc. But he says he's okay with all that except for her latest comment about going to a concert in Korea even if he was in the hospital.\n\nHe asked a hypothetical question, and she was completely serious in her answer, which made him heartbroken and led him to break up. Now he's asking if he's the asshole.\n\nSo, first thing to consider: Is it reasonable for him to expect her to prioritize him over her idol? He's her boyfriend, so there's an expectation of commitment. However, K-Pop fangirling can be intense, but maybe he's being too sensitive. The key point is her response to the hypothetical scenario. If she's unwilling to even consider his hypothetical situation where he's in the hospital, that's a red flag for him. \n\nBut wait, he made up a scenario that's extreme. Maybe he's trying to test her commitment? If he's using a hypothetical that's unrealistic (since they're both 18 and unlikely to be in Korea for a concert), but she takes it seriously. However, her response was that she wouldn't lie, meaning she wouldn't go. That might have been a dealbreaker for him. \n\nOn the other hand, breaking up over one question might be impulsive. He called her a psycho, which is harsh, and immediately ended things. The tattoo and other things he was okay with, but this one response tipped the scale. But is that a valid reason?\n\nAnother angle: In a relationship, communication is key. If he had concerns about her level of devotion to an idol versus her boyfriend, maybe he should have addressed it earlier. But she didn't meet his hypothetical with empathy or consideration for his feelings. Her being completely serious might indicate that her devotion to the idol is more important than their relationship in extreme scenarios.\n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. If he felt betrayed or that his partner's commitment to an idol was more important than him, ending the relationship is his choice. However, reacting with anger and calling her a psycho is not constructive. Maybe he overreacted, but he has the right to end things if he feels disrespected. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, people have different boundaries. Some might see her behavior as normal fangirling, others as inappropriate. The breaking point was her not considering his hypothetical, which he took as a sign that their relationship wasn't a priority. But maybe he should have talked about his feelings more directly instead of using a hypothetical scenario to provoke a response. \n\nSo, in conclusion, while her response was problematic, his reaction of calling her a psycho and breaking up immediately might be seen as a valid decision for himself. However, some might argue he's in the wrong for not being more understanding or for overreacting. But the core issue is whether her actions crossed a line. Since he was okay with the tattoo and other things, but this one scenario was the last straw, it's a matter of personal boundaries. Therefore, he's not in the wrong for breaking up, but maybe could have handled it better. So answer B.\n"
