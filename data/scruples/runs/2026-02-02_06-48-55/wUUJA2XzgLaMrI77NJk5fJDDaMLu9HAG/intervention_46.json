We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop obsession was in the wrong. The scenario says the girlfriend is a huge fan of Jung Yong Hwa, fangirling a lot, and even planning a concert trip to Korea. The breaking point was when she said she wouldn't go even if he was in the hospital. The author called her a psycho and ended the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author overreacted. The girlfriend's behavior includes constant fangirling, saving for a tattoo, and liking every Instagram post. The author tried to be understanding but was hurt by her response to a hypothetical scenario. \n\nIn relationships, trust and mutual respect are key. The girlfriend's answer might have made the author feel undervalued. However, the author's reaction\u2014calling her a psycho and breaking up immediately\u2014might have been harsh. It's possible he didn't address the issue constructively, like discussing his feelings instead of reacting with anger. \n\nOn the other hand, if the girlfriend was unwilling to consider his feelings and showed no flexibility in a hypothetical that affects their relationship, that could be a problem. The key here is whether the author's response was proportional. Breaking up over one conversation without prior discussion might not be the best approach. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If he felt that her priorities and commitment were misplaced, leading to his decision, then maybe he isn't the asshole. However, the way he handled it\u2014immediately cutting off without trying to resolve the issue\u2014could be seen as hasty. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the answer might hinge on whether the author acted out of justified hurt or overreacted. The community might split, but generally, people might side with the author if the girlfriend's actions were genuinely affecting the relationship's foundation. Alternatively, some might say he should have handled it better. But given the context, I think the answer is B (author not in the wrong) because the breaking point was a serious issue about commitment and priorities, and her response indicated a lack of consideration for his feelings.\n"
