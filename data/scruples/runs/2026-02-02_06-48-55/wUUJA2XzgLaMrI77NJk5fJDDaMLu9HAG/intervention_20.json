We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who broke up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop obsession) is in the wrong. The scenario involves the girlfriend being extremely fangirl over Jung Yong Hwa, even more so than the author can handle. The breaking point was when she said nothing would stop her from attending his concert, even if the author was in the hospital.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author and his girlfriend have been dating for over a month. He mentions that he's tried to be attentive to her interests, even though he doesn't like K-Pop. He's okay with her liking the artist, even the tattoo plan. But the final straw was her commitment to attending the concert no matter what, including if he were in the hospital. \n\nNow, the key question is whether the author overreacted. Breaking up over one statement seems drastic. The user thinks the author is wrong, but others might argue that the girlfriend's response indicated a lack of empathy or prioritization. The girlfriend's answer was that she wouldn't lie, implying she would go regardless of his situation. That could be seen as heartless, but maybe the author could have handled it differently. \n\nBut wait, the author called her a psycho and ended the relationship immediately. That's a harsh reaction. Even if the girlfriend's response was unsettling, breaking up without discussing it further might be hasty. Relationships require communication and understanding. If the author felt hurt, maybe talking through the issue and setting boundaries would have been better than an abrupt breakup. \n\nOn the flip side, the girlfriend's behavior suggests that her commitment to Jung Yong Hwa might overshadow her commitment to the relationship. If this is a recurring issue, the author might feel that their needs aren't being met. However, one incident might not be enough to justify ending the relationship. The author's reaction could stem from deeper issues in the relationship that weren't addressed before this.\n\nAlso, considering the girlfriend's actions\u2014liking every Instagram post, planning a tattoo, and the concert\u2014she has a strong emotional attachment. The author's question is whether her love for this artist is problematic. The girlfriend didn't apologize or back down, which the author found unacceptable. But maybe the author should have addressed this earlier instead of letting it escalate to a breaking point.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author's reaction might be seen as disproportionate. Ending the relationship because of an extreme hypothetical scenario could be seen as overreacting. However, if the author felt that this was a red line for him, then it was his choice. The problem is whether the author acted inconsiderately. By calling her a psycho, he might have been cruel without trying to resolve the issue. \n\nSo, weighing both sides: the author might be in the wrong because he didn't give the situation a chance to be discussed calmly and instead ended things abruptly. The girlfriend's answer was hurtful, but the author's response was equally harsh. Therefore, the answer could be that the author is in the wrong (A). However, some might argue that if the girlfriend's behavior was consistently problematic, the author is justified (B). But based on the information given, the sudden breakup without discussion leans towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
