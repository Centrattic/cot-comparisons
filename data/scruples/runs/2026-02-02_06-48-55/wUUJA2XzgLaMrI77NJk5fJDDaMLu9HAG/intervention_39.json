We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong when he broke up with his girlfriend over her K-pop obsession. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the details. The couple has been dating seriously for over a month. The guy isn't a big fan of K-pop but tries to be supportive. The girlfriend is really into Jung Yong Hwa, to the point of fangirling a lot. She likes his music, follows his social media, likes every post, and even wants a tattoo of his name. The breaking point comes when she says she would go to his concert in Korea even if he was in the hospital. The guy is heartbroken and ends things.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but is that the case? Let's consider the dynamics. The guy says he's okay with most of her K-pop stuff, including the tattoo. But the concert decision is what pushed him. The key point here is about the expectations in a relationship. When he asked hypothetically if she'd go even if he was in the hospital, she was honest but it hurt him. \n\nIs it fair to break up over this? Well, the guy's reaction was immediate and drastic. He called her a psycho and ended the relationship. That seems intense. But maybe he had been feeling uncomfortable for a while and this was the last straw. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's response might have been honest, but did she not consider how it would affect him? If they had been in a relationship for a month, communication is important. Maybe the guy didn't express his feelings clearly before, expecting her to know that her actions were hurting him. \n\nBut in a serious relationship, both partners should make each other a priority. If the girlfriend is willing to prioritize a K-pop artist over her partner in a serious situation, that could be a deal-breaker. However, the way the guy handled it might be too harsh. Breaking up over one hypothetical question, especially after a month, might not be the best approach. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's answer was honest, which is good, but maybe she didn't realize the depth of his feelings. The guy might not have communicated his boundaries clearly before. So, was the breakup justified? Or was it impulsive? \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the guy's reaction was extreme. Breaking up immediately after the conversation without discussing or trying to resolve the issue could make him the asshole. However, if this was a build-up of feelings and the conversation was the final trigger, maybe he's not in the wrong. \n\nBut generally, relationships require communication and compromise. If he didn't talk to her about his feelings before the hypothetical scenario, he might have been in the wrong for not addressing the issue earlier. Ending things over one conversation might be a reaction rather than a thoughtful decision. \n\nSo, the answer could be that the author is not in the wrong (B), but some might argue he's in the wrong for not handling it more maturely. It's a bit of a toss-up, but since the user is leaning towards A (author in the wrong), but I need to consider both sides. Maybe the key is that breaking up over this without prior discussion makes him the asshole. Or maybe the girlfriend's response made it clear that he wasn't her priority, so he's justified. \n\nHmm. I think the answer is A (author in the wrong) because he broke up immediately without working through the issue. But others might say B (not in the wrong) because her actions indicated she prioritized someone she's never met over him in a crisis scenario. It's a tough call, but given the context, maybe the author is not in the wrong because her response was a red flag he couldn't overlook. However, his reaction might be too harsh. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he's the one who ended the relationship, if his reason is valid, he's not in the wrong. If his reason is a minor issue, he is. The user thinks he's in the wrong, but I need to decide. \n\nI think the answer is B (author not in the wrong) because her answer shows she prioritizes a fictional scenario over a serious health issue for her partner. It's a red flag, and breaking up over that is justified. The way he handled it was abrupt, but given the context, maybe he's not in the wrong. So I'll go with B.\n"
