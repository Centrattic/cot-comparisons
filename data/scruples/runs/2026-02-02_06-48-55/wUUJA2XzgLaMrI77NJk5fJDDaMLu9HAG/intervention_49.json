We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong after breaking up with his girlfriend over her K-pop obsession. I need to figure out if he's the asshole here or not. The author is male, 18, and they've been dating seriously for over a month. The main issue is her fangirling over Jung Yong Hwa, which he finds annoying, but the breaking point was when she said she'd go to his concert in Korea even if he was in the hospital.\n\nFirst, I should consider the context. They've been dating for a month, which isn't that long, but it's serious. Her love for K-pop is extreme, but he's tried to be understanding. The tattoo and saving money for the concert are big commitments. But the key moment is when he asks if she'd still go if he was in the hospital. Her response is that she wouldn't lie, implying she'd go regardless. That's what made him break up with her.\n\nNow, thinking about whether he's in the wrong. He broke up because her loyalty and commitment were questionable. But maybe he overreacted? How big is the issue? K-pop fangirling is common, but her behavior is extreme. However, breaking up over this seems harsh. The question is about whether her actions were a dealbreaker. The author might feel betrayed, but maybe he didn't communicate his feelings properly. He set up a hypothetical that's extreme and then reacted strongly to her answer. Was that a fair way to test her? She didn't lie; she was honest. Maybe he expected her to prioritize him over her fandom, which might be a fair point, but her response shows she values her passion more than the relationship in that scenario. \n\nBut is that enough to end a serious relationship? It's possible he was insecure or felt neglected. However, breaking up because of this might be too quick. On the other hand, if he felt this was a dealbreaker from the start, maybe ending it was justified. The community's reaction might vary. Some might say he's overreacting, others might agree he's protecting himself. \n\nAnother angle: the author is young (18), and relationships at that age can be volatile. He might not have fully processed his feelings. The girlfriend's behavior might have been a red flag, but he could have addressed it earlier instead of testing her with a hypothetical. Her answer was honest, but maybe he should have considered if their values align. However, the way he reacted\u2014calling her a psycho and cutting off immediately\u2014seems impulsive. \n\nIn terms of whether he's in the wrong, it's a judgment call. If he felt her priorities were misplaced and that she didn't value their relationship, then breaking up might be his right. But if he didn't communicate his concerns beforehand and this was a sudden trigger, maybe he's rushing to judgment. The community often considers communication and effort in relationships. He tried to pay attention to her interests but couldn't handle the intensity. Her response was factual, but breaking up over it could be seen as him not dealing with the issue maturely. \n\nSo, the answer could be that he's not in the wrong because he's standing up for his own needs, but others might argue he was too quick to end things. However, based on the scenario, the key is that her commitment to her fandom overrode his hypothetical situation, which he found unacceptable. If he couldn't accept her as she is, including her fandom, then breaking up is his choice. Therefore, he's not the asshole.\n"
