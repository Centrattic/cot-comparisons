We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with their girlfriend over her K-Pop fandom is in the wrong. So, first, I need to understand the situation as presented.\n\nThe guy is 18, and they've been dating seriously for over a month. The girlfriend is into K-Pop, specifically Jung Yong Hwa. He's tried to be patient, even though he doesn't like K-Pop. She's been fangirling a lot, but he could handle that until the recent conversation. She mentioned saving up for a tattoo of the artist's name and wanting to go to his concert in Korea, even if he were in the hospital. The guy said she was a psycho and broke up with her.\n\nNow, the user is asking if the author (the guy) is in the wrong. The options are A for yes and B for no. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong but is curious what others think.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are about boundaries and communication in a relationship. The guy had been trying to be understanding, but the breaking point was when she said she wouldn't go to the concert even if he was in the hospital. He felt heartbroken and left, so he ended the relationship. The question is whether that was the right call or if he overreacted.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to discuss and set boundaries. If the guy felt uncomfortable with her level of fandom, maybe there should have been earlier conversations about it. However, the specific issue here was her prioritizing her fandom over his health. That seems extreme from his perspective. But maybe she was just being dramatic or not taking the scenario seriously.\n\nBut then again, he might have overreacted. The scenario he posed was hypothetical, and maybe she didn't mean it literally. Also, considering they've only been dating a month, maybe this was a point where he realized their values clashed. On the other hand, breaking up because of a hypothetical situation might be hasty. It's possible he didn't communicate his feelings beforehand and let it build up until this moment.\n\nThere's also the aspect of his reaction. Calling her a psycho is pretty harsh, which could make him seem inconsiderate. But he was heartbroken, so maybe that's a justified emotional response. The tattoo and concert plans were things he was okay with, but her response to his hypothetical question was the last straw.\n\nI think the key here is whether her answer was a dealbreaker for him. If he couldn't accept her prioritizing her fandom over his well-being even hypothetically, then breaking up might not be the wrong move. However, if he had not communicated his feelings earlier and this was a sudden reaction, maybe he did overstep. Also, the fact that they only been dating a month might mean he didn't give it enough time to see if they could work through it.\n\nIn some perspectives, people have different values and interests, and it's okay to part ways if those differences are irreconcilable. But if he was okay with the tattoo and concerts before, maybe the hypothetical scenario was an overreaction. It's also possible that the way he broke up with her was harsh, but the decision itself might be justified if he felt it was a dealbreaker.\n\nSo, weighing all that, I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong. He tried to be patient, set a boundary when it came to a hypothetical that made him feel unimportant, and broke up when he realized it was a dealbreaker. However, some might argue that he should have addressed it earlier or handled the breakup more respectfully. But in terms of whether he's the asshole, maybe not. So answer B.\n"
