We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop fandom is in the wrong. The situation is that he's 18, they've been dating seriously for over a month. She's a big fan of Jung Yong Hwa, to the point of getting a tattoo and wanting to go to a concert in Korea. He's okay with most of that but was upset when she said she'd go to the concert even if he was in the hospital.\n\nHmm. First, I need to think about the core issue here. He broke up because she was willing to prioritize her fandom over him in an extreme scenario. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nOn one hand, it's understandable that he felt hurt. If someone said that about his partner, he might feel neglected or not a priority. But they've only been dating a month. That's pretty short for a serious relationship. Maybe he's overreacting? Or maybe it's valid if he felt that way. \n\nHer actions: liking every Instagram post, getting a tattoo, fangirling. He says he's okay with all that. The breaking point was her hypothetical commitment to the concert despite his being in the hospital. But that's a hypothetical scenario. Maybe she was just role-playing and not serious, but he took it as a real answer. \n\nHe says he called her a psycho and broke up. That's pretty harsh. Maybe he didn't give her a chance to clarify or talk it out. Communication is key in relationships. If he felt this way, perhaps he should have discussed it more calmly. \n\nAlso, the tattoo on her chest is a big commitment. Maybe he's concerned about her priorities. But K-Pop is a big thing for many fans. It's possible she sees it as a hobby and not a priority over their relationship. \n\nAnother angle: he's 18, so maybe he's still figuring out relationships. His reaction might be impulsive. But she's also 18, so both are young. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If he didn't communicate his feelings earlier and just lashed out after one conversation, maybe he's not handling it well. However, if the scenario made him realize they aren't compatible in terms of priorities, then he's not the asshole. \n\nBut the key here is that she said she wouldn't lie. He was shocked she was serious, but maybe he should have considered that she was exaggerating. Also, breaking up immediately and calling her a psycho might be too harsh. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because he reacted impulsively and didn't handle it maturely. But some might argue B (not in the wrong) because he had a right to feel hurt. But the question is if the author is in the wrong. Given the immediate breakup and harsh words, maybe A is the better answer.\n"
