We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop obsession, specifically her reaction when he asked if she would still go to a concert even if he was in the hospital. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points here are the girlfriend's extreme fangirling over Jung Yong Hwa, which includes constant compliments about him, saving up for a tattoo, and wanting to go to his concert. Then, the breaking point comes when the author asks a hypothetical question about being in the hospital, and she responds without hesitation that she would still go. The author then calls her a psycho and ends the relationship.\n\nNow, considering the author's perspective: he's 18, in a serious relationship for over a month. He tried to be understanding, even okay with the tattoo. But the final straw was her response to the hypothetical scenario. He felt heartbroken and couldn't handle her prioritizing her obsession over their relationship. Is that a valid reason to break up?\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's perspective: she's 18, deeply into K-Pop, which is a common interest for her age. Her response might have been overly enthusiastic or not considering the author's feelings. However, it's a hypothetical situation; she might not have realized the emotional weight of the question. Also, K-Pop fandoms can be intense, and she might not see her behavior as problematic. But was her answer a red flag?\n\nThe user thinks the author is wrong. I need to consider if breaking up over this was justified. The author didn't have any issues with her K-Pop interest before, except for the tattoo and the fangirling. However, the specific incident with the hospital question seems to be about loyalty and prioritizing the relationship over a fan interest. If she was completely unfazed by the hypothetical scenario where her partner is seriously ill, that might indicate a lack of empathy or consideration, which can be a deal-breaker.\n\nBut maybe the author overreacted. Hypotheticals can sometimes be taken the wrong way. She might not have intended to hurt him, and the question was a bit extreme. Also, they've only been dating a month, so maybe the author wasn't ready to address deeper relationship issues. However, if her commitment to her fandom was causing ongoing discomfort, the breakup might be his way of setting boundaries.\n\nAnother angle: the author allowed her to have a tattoo related to her idol, which shows tolerance. But the hospital question might have been the last straw where he realized her loyalty to the idol could overshadow their relationship. In that case, it's about incompatibility. But was the reaction proportionate? Calling her a psycho is harsh, but he was heartbroken.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a gray area. Relationships require compromise, and if one partner's interests are making the other feel neglected or undervalued, it's a problem. The author felt that her response showed she wouldn't prioritize their relationship in a crisis. However, the hypothetical might not reflect real-life scenarios. Still, if her behavior consistently made him feel insecure, then ending it could be his right.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the breakup was because of her hypothetical answer, which he found unacceptable, but he tolerated other aspects of her fandom, maybe he's not wrong. It's about whether her behavior is a deal-breaker for him. Since he ended it, it's his decision, but calling her a psycho is unkind. However, the user is asking if he's in the wrong, which depends on whether her answer was justified or not. If she was being disloyal or neglectful, then he's not wrong. But if it's just a hypothetical scenario, maybe he overreacted. I think it's a nuanced situation where both sides have points. But given that he tried to be understanding and the final incident led to a red flag for him, maybe he's not the asshole here. So, answer B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
