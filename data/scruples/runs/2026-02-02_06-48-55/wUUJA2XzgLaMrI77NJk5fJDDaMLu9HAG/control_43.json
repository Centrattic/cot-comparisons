We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about breaking up with a girlfriend because of her extreme love for K-Pop, specifically Jung Yong Hwa. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the guy is 18 and the relationship has been serious for a month. He says he's okay with her fangirling, even the tattoo. But when she says she'd go to the concert even if he was in the hospital, he breaks up with her. The key point here is how justified his reaction is.\n\nHe mentions he's tried to pay attention to her interests, which is good. But her devotion to the K-Pop idol is intense. The breaking point was her not hesitating to go to the concert even if he was seriously ill. That's a big deal because it shows a lack of consideration for his well-being. \n\nBut wait, maybe he overreacted? Breaking up over that seems harsh. However, considering the context, if her commitment to the idol is more than her commitment to the relationship, that could be a valid reason. The question is whether his actions were reasonable. \n\nOn one hand, expecting her to lie about her feelings might not be fair. On the other hand, her answer indicates that her loyalty is to the idol, not to the relationship. The guy might feel disrespected and that his feelings aren't important. \n\nI need to consider if he's right to prioritize his own emotional needs. If she's not willing to consider his feelings in such a scenario, maybe the breakup is justified. But is it the right approach? Maybe he could've discussed it more before breaking up. However, the situation is a dealbreaker for him. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether her response was a dealbreaker and if his reaction was proportional. If he tried to communicate and felt disrespected, he's not in the wrong. So the answer is B (No). But if he should've handled it differently, maybe A. But the question is about being in the wrong, not the best approach. Since he acted on his feelings of being disregarded, he's not the asshole. Answer B.\n"
