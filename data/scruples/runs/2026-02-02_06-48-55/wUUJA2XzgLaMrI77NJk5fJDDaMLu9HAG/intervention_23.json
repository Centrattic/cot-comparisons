We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with their girlfriend over her K-Pop fandom is in the wrong. The situation is that the girlfriend is a huge fan of Jung Yong Hwa, to the point of getting a tattoo and wanting to go to a concert in Korea. The breaking point was when the boyfriend asked if she'd still go if he were in the hospital, and she said yes without hesitation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The girlfriend's behavior isn't just liking K-Pop; it's an intense level of fangirling. She's saving money for a tattoo, likes every Instagram post, and is planning a concert. The boyfriend mentions he tries to be understanding but is bothered by her constant praise of the artist over him. The key moment is the hospital scenario where she doesn't prioritize his well-being over her fandom.\n\nNow, the question is whether the breakup is justified. The boyfriend felt heartbroken and called her a psycho. Breaking up over this could be seen as a reaction to feeling neglected or disrespected. However, it's also important to consider if his expectations were unreasonable. Maybe he should have communicated his feelings earlier instead of testing her loyalty with a hypothetical extreme situation. On the other hand, her response might indicate a lack of emotional consideration for him, which could be a valid reason for ending the relationship.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to assess both sides. The boyfriend acted on his feelings of rejection and hurt, which are valid emotions. However, the question is whether his actions were appropriate. Breaking up over a hypothetical scenario might not be the healthiest approach, but it's a reaction to a situation where he felt his partner's commitment wasn't aligned with his own needs. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If the boyfriend had previously expressed discomfort with her level of fangirling, her response might have been a red flag. But if he didn't address it earlier, maybe the breakup was a reaction to an isolated incident rather than a pattern. \n\nConsidering all this, the boyfriend's actions might be seen as a response to a deal-breaker for him. If he felt her priorities were misaligned, then ending the relationship isn't necessarily the wrong choice. However, the way he lashed out (\"called her a complete psycho\") is unkind and could be seen as harsh. But the core issue is whether her behavior crossed a line he couldn't accept. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, relationships are subjective. What's important is whether both parties considered each other's feelings. The key is whether the breakup was based on a legitimate concern or an overreaction. Since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, and given the girlfriend's behavior, it's possible the author isn't in the wrong. So, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong). But some might argue he should have handled it differently. However, given the extreme hypothetical scenario and her response, his feelings are valid, so he's not the asshole. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
