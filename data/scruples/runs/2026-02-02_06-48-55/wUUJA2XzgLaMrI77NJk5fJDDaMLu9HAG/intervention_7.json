We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who broke up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop fandom is in the wrong. The situation is that the couple has been dating for over a month. The guy isn't into K-Pop, but he's tried to be attentive. The girlfriend is really into Jung Yong Hwa, to the point of fangirling a lot, saving for a tattoo, and liking all his social media posts. The breaking point was when he asked her if she'd still go to his concert in Korea even if he were in the hospital, and she said she wouldn't lie, meaning she'd go. He found that heart-breaking and broke up.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author was wrong. The key points here are about boundaries in a relationship, communication, and what's acceptable. The guy was okay with her K-Pop interest up until this specific comment. The question is whether her response was a deal-breaker or if he overreacted.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend's dedication to a celebrity is intense, but so what? Many people have passions, even if they're one-sided. The issue arises when it affects the relationship. The author's main problem is her saying she'd go to the concert even if he were sick. That seems to indicate a lack of consideration for his feelings in that hypothetical scenario. However, it's a hypothetical, and maybe she was just being honest. \n\nBut in a month-long relationship, is this too much to ask for? The author might feel that her priorities are misplaced. However, breaking up over this could be seen as extreme. The author didn't try to address the issue through communication or discuss their expectations in the relationship. He seems to have taken it personally, seeing her loyalty to the celebrity as a sign of not prioritizing the relationship. But maybe she didn't mean it to be a test of her commitment to him. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author felt this was a red line for him, maybe he should have communicated that earlier. Instead of making a hypothetical and then breaking up immediately upon her answer. It's possible he didn't handle it well. The girlfriend might not have realized how much this would hurt him. \n\nSo, the author acted impulsively. He didn't approach it as a conversation but rather a test, and when she failed, he ended things. That could be seen as the wrong move. The girlfriend's actions were within her rights as a fan, and her honesty might not be a valid reason to break up. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for overreacting and not addressing the issue more constructively.\n"
