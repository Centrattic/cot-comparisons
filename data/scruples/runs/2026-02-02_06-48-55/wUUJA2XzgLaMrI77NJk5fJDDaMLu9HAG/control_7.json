We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who broke up with his girlfriend over her K-Pop obsession is in the wrong. So, the situation is that the guy is 18, and the girlfriend is also 18. They've been dating for over a month. He's not into K-Pop, but he tries to be supportive. She's really into Jung Yong Hwa, to the point of fangirling a lot. She likes his music, follows his Instagram, likes all his posts, and even wants a tattoo of his name on her chest. The breaking point was when he asked her if she'd still go to his concert in Korea even if he was in the hospital, and she said she wouldn't lie, implying she'd go regardless.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The guy tried to be understanding and even said he was okay with the tattoo. The issue was her response to a hypothetical scenario. The question is whether that response is a valid reason to break up. \n\nHe set up a hypothetical where he's very ill, which is a serious situation. Her answer, as he reports, was that she wouldn't lie and would still go to the concert. That suggests she prioritizes her fandom over his well-being. For him, this might have felt like a lack of commitment to their relationship. \n\nHowever, it's also important to consider if the hypothetical is a bit extreme. Maybe he's using a hyperbolic scenario to test her loyalty. But if she's completely serious, that could indicate a problem in the relationship. \n\nOn the other hand, breaking up over this might seem harsh if the issue is about fandom. But if her response shows that her commitment to the idol is more important than her partner's health, then maybe the guy has a point. However, it's possible that her answer was misunderstood or taken out of context. \n\nAlso, they've only been dating a month. The relationship's maturity and communication might be factors. If this was the first time he brought it up, maybe he didn't address it properly. But if he's been feeling this way for a while and just couldn't handle it anymore, breaking up could be justified. \n\nThe key here is whether her answer was a deal-breaker for him. If he felt that her prioritization of the idol over his health was unacceptable, then he's not wrong to break up. But some might argue that the hypothetical is too extreme and not a real situation, so the breakup is overreacting. \n\nHowever, the fact that he tried to be supportive before this incident might mean that this was the final straw. In relationships, compatibility in values and priorities is important. If her love for the idol is causing him pain and he can't reconcile it, then he's not wrong to end the relationship. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
