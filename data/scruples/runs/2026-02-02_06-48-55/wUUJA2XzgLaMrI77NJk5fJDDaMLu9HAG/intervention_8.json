We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her extreme K-Pop fandom. The situation is that the girlfriend is really into Jung Yong Hwa, to the point of planning a concert in Korea, saving for a tattoo, etc. The breaking point was when the author asked if she'd go to the concert even if he was in the hospital, and she said she wouldn't lie, implying she'd still go. The author then broke up with her, calling her a psycho.\n\nSo, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants confirmation. The possible answers are A (Yes, wrong) or B (No, not wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. On one hand, the author was hurt by her response. The question about being in the hospital is a hypothetical that challenges the depth of her commitment. Her answer, being honest that she wouldn't lie, suggests she values her fandom over the relationship in a hypothetical crisis. That might be a dealbreaker for the author, which is a valid reason to break up. People have different dealbreakers, and if this crosses a line for him, then it's his right to end it.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might have overreacted. The hypothetical scenario is extreme and maybe not a realistic reflection of her actual feelings. K-Pop fandom can be intense, but does that make her a \"psycho\"? The author's choice of words could be seen as harsh. Also, breaking up over a hypothetical without discussing it further might be impulsive. However, the girlfriend's commitment to the fandom despite the relationship could be seen as a red flag, and the author might feel that his well-being is not her priority.\n\nThe key points here are mutual respect and communication. The author tried to engage in the conversation, but the response triggered his feelings. Whether it's right or wrong depends on how the situation is viewed. In relationships, it's important that both partners feel valued. If her actions consistently undermine his feelings, that's a problem. But if the author reacted without giving her a chance to explain or address the issue, that's another aspect.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be in the wrong for ending the relationship if this was a significant dealbreaker. However, calling her a \"psycho\" is a strong and potentially disrespectful term, which could be seen as an overreaction. But given the context, if this was the breaking point after accumulated feelings, maybe it's understandable. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (Not in the wrong) because the author had his reasons based on his comfort and the hypothetical scenario. However, the way he broke up (calling her a psycho) is questionable. But in the context of a breakup, people do say things they regret. The main issue is whether the breakup was justified. Since he was heartbroken and felt disrespected in a hypothetical that tested her commitment, it's a personal choice. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
