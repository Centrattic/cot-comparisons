      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the question is in the wrong for being upset that their wife didn't let them attend the newborn gender reveal ultrasound. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a husband who's upset because his wife didn't allow him to attend the ultrasound where they find out the baby's gender. He's asking if he's in the wrong (AITA - Am I the Asshole). The user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong and wants to know if others agree.\n\nNow, considering possible reasons why the wife might not let him come. Maybe she wanted to know the gender privately, or perhaps there was a cultural or personal tradition involved. For example, in some cultures, the mother gets to find out first, or maybe they have a tradition where the mother shares the news in a specific way. Alternatively, maybe she had medical reasons, like the ultrasound was a private appointment, or she wanted to surprise him later.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband might feel left out, especially if he was looking forward to sharing that moment. It's important to consider communication between them. Did they discuss this beforehand? If the wife didn't explain her reasons, that could lead to confusion. If the husband felt excluded without any prior discussion, maybe his reaction is understandable, but if the wife had valid reasons and communicated them, he might be overreacting.\n\nAlso, gender reveal parties are often social events where the gender is announced, but the ultrasound itself is a medical procedure. Attending an ultrasound is different from a party. If the ultrasound was scheduled without him and there was no prior agreement, maybe the wife's decision was okay. However, if it's a routine part of the pregnancy to share those moments, then being excluded might feel wrong.\n\nAnother angle: The husband's reaction could stem from feeling excluded in a significant moment. That's a valid emotion. But if the wife had a legitimate reason and the husband didn't ask or communicate his feelings, maybe he's partly responsible for not expressing his needs. Alternatively, if the wife unilaterally decided without considering his feelings, she might be at fault.\n\nLooking at similar scenarios, sometimes cultural or personal differences play a role. If the wife comes from a background where this is customary, it might not be her intention to exclude him. But if the husband didn't know about this custom, he might feel wronged. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. If the husband is upset without understanding the context, he might be in the wrong. If the wife didn't consider his feelings, she might be. But since the question is from the husband's perspective, we need to assess his responsibility.\n\nIn conclusion, if there's no communication and the husband assumes the worst without knowing the wife's reasons, he could be in the wrong. If there was no prior discussion and he just got upset, then maybe yes. But if the wife had no valid reason and just excluded him without explanation, he's not in the wrong. However, given that it's a personal decision and the husband's reaction is based on feeling excluded, it's possible he's in the wrong unless there's more context. Since the user thinks he's in the wrong, but I need to evaluate. The answer might be A (Yes) if the husband's reaction is disproportionate or if the wife had valid reasons. However, without more context, it's hard to say. But considering typical scenarios, sometimes people get upset over not being invited to a moment that's traditionally for one parent, and that's not necessarily the case. So maybe A is the answer here.\n"
