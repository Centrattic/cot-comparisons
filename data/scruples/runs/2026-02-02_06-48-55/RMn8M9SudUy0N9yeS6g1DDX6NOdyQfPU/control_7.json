      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that his wife won't let him come to the newborn's gender reveal ultrasound. So, the question is about whether the author's reaction is justified.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The husband wants to attend the ultrasound, but the wife is excluding him. Why would she do that? Maybe she wanted to keep it a secret for a future reveal, or perhaps she's had issues in the past where she felt excluded, or maybe there's a cultural or personal reason. On the other hand, the husband is upset because he's being left out of a significant event in his child's life.\n\nIn many relationships, both parents are involved in prenatal care. However, gender reveal ultrasounds can sometimes be a point of contention. Some parents prefer to keep the gender a surprise for a party or another event. If the wife has communicated her reasons clearly and the husband still feels upset, maybe there's a communication breakdown. But if the wife didn't explain her reasons, that could be an issue too.\n\nAnother angle: The husband's right to be involved versus the wife's autonomy in decision-making. It's important to respect each other's perspectives. If the wife is making a decision without considering his feelings, that's a problem. But if she's made a reasonable choice (like wanting a surprise) and he's not respecting that, then he might be in the wrong.\n\nAlso, the way the situation is presented. The husband is asking if he's wrong for being upset. If he's expressing his feelings without being confrontational, that's valid. But if he's being controlling or not respecting her decision, then he's at fault.\n\nI think the key factors here are communication and mutual respect. If the wife decided not to let him attend for a valid reason and he's not respecting that, he's in the wrong. But if she didn't explain her reasons and he's just naturally upset about being excluded from a shared experience, that's different. However, without more context, it's hard to say. But in most cases, if the wife's decision is based on her own preferences and the husband is upset because he feels left out, it's a matter of balancing both needs. However, unless the husband is being unreasonable in his reaction, maybe he's not in the wrong. But if the wife's choice is her right, then he might be overreacting. Hmm. I'm a bit torn here. Maybe the answer is B (No) because he's allowed to be upset if he feels excluded, but it's a delicate balance. Alternatively, A if she has a valid reason and he's being selfish. But without knowing her reasons, it's hard. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he's just expressing his feelings, probably not. So B.\n"
