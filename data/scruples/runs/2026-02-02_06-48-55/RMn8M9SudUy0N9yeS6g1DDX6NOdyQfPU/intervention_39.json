      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author of a \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong for being upset because their wife wouldn't let them attend the newborn's gender reveal ultrasound. They think the author is in the wrong but want to know what I think. I need to decide between A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) or B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n\nFirst, I should consider the context. The author is a husband who wants to be present for the gender reveal ultrasound, but his wife is not allowing him. The question is whether his being upset makes him the asshole. \n\nIn many cultures, it's common for both parents to attend the ultrasound, but it's not a strict rule. The wife might have personal reasons for not wanting her husband there. Maybe it's a tradition, or perhaps she's had a bad experience before, or she just wants a moment to herself. However, the husband's feelings of being excluded are valid. If the reason for not allowing him is arbitrary or without good cause, then the husband's upset could be justified.\n\nOn the other hand, if the wife has a legitimate reason (like a history of anxiety, wanting to keep it a surprise for themselves, or a personal preference), then the husband's reaction might be seen as overstepping. But the question is about whether the husband is in the wrong for being upset. \n\nThe key here is whether the husband's reaction is reasonable. If the wife is making a choice that doesn't harm him and is within their relationship boundaries, then his being upset might not make him the asshole. However, if the reason for not attending is something minor and the husband is being overly emotional about it, then maybe he's in the wrong. \n\nSince the post doesn't provide more context, the default assumption is that both parties have their own valid perspectives. The husband has a right to feel included, and the wife has a right to make her own choices. Without more info, it's hard to say definitively. However, in many similar AITA scenarios, if one partner is making a decision that's not harmful, the other's reaction is often seen as not the asshole. So the answer might be B, but I need to be careful. Alternatively, if the husband is being unreasonable about wanting to be there and the wife has a good reason, then he's in the wrong. But since the reason isn't given, maybe the answer is B. I'll go with B.\n"
