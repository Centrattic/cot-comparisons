      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is upset because their wife won't let them attend the newborn gender reveal ultrasound. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to consider typical gender roles and cultural norms. In some cultures, it's common for the mother to go to certain prenatal appointments alone, especially the gender reveal, which might be seen as a more personal moment. However, in other contexts, both parents might attend all appointments together. The key here is that the wife is making a decision that the husband is unhappy about.\n\nI should think about the reasons the wife might have. Maybe she wanted to keep the gender a surprise for a bigger reveal later, or she might have personal reasons for not wanting the husband there. Alternatively, there could be logistical issues, like the appointment being scheduled at a time when the husband can't attend, but the husband might not know that. Without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nThe author's frustration is understandable if he feels excluded, especially if he's been involved in other aspects of the pregnancy. However, the wife has the right to make decisions about her own medical appointments. Unless there's a history of conflict or the husband was promised he could attend, the wife's decision might be within her rights.\n\nOn the other hand, if the husband was included in previous appointments and this is a sudden change without explanation, that could be a point of tension. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the wife chose not to include him for her own reasons, and there's no coercion or prior agreement that was broken, then the author might not be in the wrong. However, if the husband's exclusion is causing unnecessary distress without valid reason, maybe he's overreacting.\n\nBut I should also consider that the husband's feelings are valid. He might feel left out, which is a legitimate emotional response. However, the wife has autonomy over her medical care. Unless the husband was explicitly involved in decisions and now is being excluded without reason, it's hard to say he's wrong. The answer might depend on whether there was prior discussion or if the wife had a valid reason.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the answer often hinges on whether there's a clear right or wrong. Here, since the wife is making a personal choice about her body and medical appointments, the husband's upset might be seen as a valid emotional reaction, but not necessarily making him the asshole. So the answer might be B, No, the author isn't in the wrong because he's expressing his feelings, though the wife's decision is her right.\n"
