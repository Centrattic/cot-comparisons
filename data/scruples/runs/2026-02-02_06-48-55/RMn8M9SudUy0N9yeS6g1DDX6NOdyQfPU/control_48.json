      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for being upset that his wife won't let him come to the newborn's gender reveal ultrasound. The scenario is pretty straightforward.\n\nFirst, I need to think about typical gender reveal practices. In many cases, it's common for one parent to be kept in the dark while the other finds out first, often as a surprise. This is usually done for fun or tradition. So, if the wife decided to have the ultrasound without her husband, maybe she wanted to surprise him later. \n\nBut the husband is upset about not being allowed to attend. Is he in the wrong? Well, it's a personal decision between partners. The wife has the right to make choices about her medical appointments, especially if it's her idea for a surprise. However, the husband's feelings are valid too. Feeling excluded might be hurtful, but the wife's choice isn't necessarily wrong if she explained her reasoning.\n\nI should also consider cultural norms. In some places, the father might be kept in suspense for the gender reveal, which the wife could be doing here. The husband's upset might be because he values being included in all prenatal decisions. But unless there was an agreement beforehand, the wife isn't obligated to include him in that specific moment.\n\nThe key here is mutual respect. If the wife explained her reasons and the husband still feels upset, they might need to discuss their expectations. However, the wife isn't automatically in the wrong for wanting to keep it a secret. So, the answer is probably B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
