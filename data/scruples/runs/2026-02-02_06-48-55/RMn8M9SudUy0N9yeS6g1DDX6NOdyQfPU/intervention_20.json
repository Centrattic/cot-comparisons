      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong because their wife won't let them attend the newborn's gender reveal ultrasound. The user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to decide if the answer is A or B.\n\nFirst, I should consider the context. The post is from someone upset about not being allowed to attend the ultrasound. The wife is the one making the decision here. So, the author's grievance is about being excluded. \n\nI need to think about typical scenarios. Sometimes, in such situations, the decision to exclude a partner might be due to personal reasons, like wanting privacy, medical advice, or cultural practices. Maybe the wife has a reason not to include the husband, but he feels it's unfair. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, the post is about being upset. The question is whether the husband's feelings being hurt make him at fault. If the wife has a valid reason, maybe the husband overreacting is the issue. But if the wife's decision is arbitrary or unjust, then the husband isn't in the wrong. However, without more context, it's hard to say. \n\nBut the user says they think the author is in the wrong. The user might be assuming that the husband's reaction is unreasonable. Maybe the husband is making a big deal out of something minor. The gender reveal is a personal moment, and the wife might have a right to decide who attends. \n\nBut the husband has a right to feel upset if he's being excluded without a good reason. However, if the wife is the one making the decision based on her comfort, then maybe the husband's reaction is unwarranted. \n\nIn typical AITA (Am I the Asshole) posts, the community often considers intent and reasonableness. If the wife's decision is reasonable, the husband's upset might be seen as overreacting. But if there's a history of issues, maybe it's different. But since there's no more context, the default would be to assume the wife has her reasons, so the husband is wrong to be upset. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
