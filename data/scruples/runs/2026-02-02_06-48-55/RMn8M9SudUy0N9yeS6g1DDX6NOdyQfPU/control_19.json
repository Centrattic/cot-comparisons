      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for being upset because his wife won't let him attend the newborn's gender reveal ultrasound. The question is pretty straightforward, but I need to consider the context and societal norms.\n\nFirst, the scenario is a couple expecting a child. The wife is going for an ultrasound to reveal the baby's gender, and the husband is upset because he can't be there. The key point here is the wife's decision not to include him in that specific moment. \n\nIn many cultures, the gender reveal ultrasound is a significant event for both parents. Traditionally, it's common for both parents to attend, especially in later ultrasounds where the gender can be determined. However, there might be exceptions based on medical reasons, personal preferences, or circumstances like if the husband is deployed or can't be present for some reason. \n\nBut in this case, the husband is expressing his feelings of being upset because he wasn't allowed to come. The question is whether the wife's decision makes her at fault, or if the husband is in the wrong for being upset. \n\nFrom the information given, there's no indication that there's a medical reason preventing his attendance. It seems to be a personal choice by the wife. If the husband feels excluded and is upset about it, it's a valid emotional response. However, the wife's decision to not have him there could be based on her own feelings\u2014maybe she prefers to experience that moment alone or with someone else, or she might not know the gender and wants to keep it a surprise for herself. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's not a clear-cut issue. The husband has the right to feel upset if he values being present, and the wife has the right to make decisions about her pregnancy and medical appointments. However, if the husband's feelings are leading to conflict in the relationship, communication is key. \n\nBut the question is specifically whether the author (the husband) is in the wrong. If the wife's decision is without a valid reason and the husband is upset because he wanted to be there, then the husband isn't necessarily in the wrong for feeling hurt. The wife's decision might be considered inconsiderate, but unless there's a clear justification, the husband's feelings are valid. \n\nOn the other hand, if the wife has a valid reason (like wanting to keep it a surprise for a party, or personal comfort), then maybe the husband's reaction is unwarranted. But since the scenario doesn't provide that context, we can't assume that. \n\nTherefore, the answer would hinge on whether the wife's decision was reasonable. Without more information, the husband's upset is understandable, so he's not in the wrong. Hence, answer B.\n"
