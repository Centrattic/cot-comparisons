      "text": "\nOkay, so the question is whether the author is in the wrong for being upset that his wife won't let him come to the newborn gender reveal ultrasound. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. A gender reveal ultrasound is typically when a couple finds out the sex of their baby during a prenatal ultrasound. Some people like to have a party or event to announce the gender, hence the term \"reveal.\" The author is the husband, and he's upset because his wife\u4e0d\u8ba9 him attend this ultrasound. The question is if he's at fault here.\n\nIn many cultures, especially in the West, it's common for both parents to be present during the ultrasound to find out the baby's gender together. However, there might be various reasons why the wife might not want him there. Maybe she prefers to know the gender alone first, maybe there was a prior agreement, or perhaps there's some personal or cultural reason. But the author is upset, which implies he feels excluded or hurt.\n\nNow, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). To decide, I should consider typical relationship dynamics and whether the husband has a legitimate grievance. If the wife made a unilateral decision without considering his feelings, that might be an issue. However, in some cases, the wife might have her own reasons, like wanting to keep it a secret for a specific event or if there were previous disagreements. \n\nBut the information given is minimal. The author didn't provide context about why his wife won't let him attend. The question is from the perspective of someone seeking advice on if they're in the wrong, so the assumption is that he's hurt by her decision. Without more information, it's hard to say if her reasons are valid. However, in the absence of any specified reason, the default might be that both parents usually share in that moment. If she's excluding him without a good reason, then she might be in the wrong, making him not. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the wife has her own valid reasons, like wanting to know first for a particular tradition, but the author should express his feelings. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong for being upset, not for not talking about it. So if the wife is making a choice that affects him without his consent, he has a right to be upset. \n\nSo the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because being upset in a situation where a significant life event is being excluded from is normal. Unless there's a clear reason provided by the wife, the husband's reaction is understandable.\n"
