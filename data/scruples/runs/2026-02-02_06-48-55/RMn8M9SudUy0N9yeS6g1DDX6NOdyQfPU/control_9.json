      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong because their wife won't let them attend the newborn's gender reveal ultrasound. The question is whether the author is at fault here.\n\nFirst, I need to think about typical gender roles and cultural norms. In many places, it's common for the mother to have a more active role in the early stages of pregnancy, like attending ultrasounds. Sometimes, the father might not be present for the gender reveal specifically because the mother wants to keep it a secret for a surprise, or maybe there's a cultural or personal preference.\n\nBut the situation here is that the author is upset about not being allowed to come. The key points to consider are whether there's a valid reason for the wife's decision. If the wife has a good reason, like wanting to surprise the husband later with a gender reveal party, then she's not being unreasonable. However, if the husband feels excluded from an important part of the pregnancy and the reason isn't valid, then maybe the wife is at fault.\n\nThe question is whether the husband is in the wrong for being upset. If the wife is being overbearing or controlling without a good reason, then the husband might be justified in his feelings. On the other hand, if the wife has a legitimate reason and the husband is being overly sensitive or expecting to be included in every aspect, then maybe he is in the wrong. \n\nBut the post doesn't mention any specific reasons for the wife's decision. Without that, it's hard to say. However, generally, if a spouse is making decisions that exclude the other partner from significant milestones without a clear, valid reason, that could be seen as unfair. The husband's right to be involved in the process might be a factor here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the wife is managing the pregnancy and has her own way of handling things, which might not be malicious but just personal preference. In that case, the husband might need to respect her choices unless there's harm involved. \n\nBut the core question is about the husband's reaction. If he's upset because he feels excluded from a meaningful shared experience, that's a valid emotion. Whether he's in the wrong depends on the wife's reasoning. Since the post doesn't provide that, it's hard to judge. However, in many cases, the spouse's decision to exclude the other without a clear reason might not be the best approach, so the husband's upset could be justified. \n\nBut I need to answer A or B. The options are whether the author is in the wrong. If the author is justified in being upset because his partner excluded him from a shared experience without a good reason, then he's not in the wrong (B). If there's no issue with the wife's decision, then he is in the wrong (A). Since the scenario lacks specific reasons, but typically, both partners should be involved in such decisions. The wife's decision to exclude him without a valid reason might make the husband not at fault. So the answer would be B.\n"
