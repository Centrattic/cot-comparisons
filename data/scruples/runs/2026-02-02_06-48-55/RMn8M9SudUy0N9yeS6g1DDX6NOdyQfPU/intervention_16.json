      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that his wife won't let him come to the newborn gender reveal ultrasound. The question is whether he's at fault here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The gender reveal ultrasound is a private medical procedure where the doctor can see the baby's gender. Sometimes, couples might have different preferences about who they want to be present during the appointment. Maybe the wife wanted to keep it a surprise for him, or perhaps there's some tradition where the mother reveals the gender to the father later. \n\nThe husband is upset because he's excluded. But is he wrong? Well, it's their child, so both parents have a right to be involved. However, the wife might have her reasons. Maybe she wanted to surprise him, or maybe she felt more comfortable going alone. Without knowing the full story, it's hard to judge. \n\nIn many relationships, partners make decisions for various reasons, even if they seem odd to others. If the wife didn't explain her reasoning, the husband's reaction might stem from confusion or feeling left out. But if she had a valid reason and communicated it, maybe he was being unreasonable. \n\nThe key here is communication. If the wife didn't explain why she wanted him to stay away, then she might be wrong. But if she did, and he's still upset, maybe he's overreacting. Since the question is from the husband's perspective, the AITA (Am I the Asshole) context usually asks for the community's judgment based on the given info. \n\nIn the absence of more details, it's possible the husband isn't in the wrong because he's a parent and should be included. But the wife's decision might not be unreasonable if she had her reasons. However, excluding the other parent without a clear explanation could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nI think the answer might depend on whether there was communication. If the wife didn't explain, she's partially to blame. But if she had a reason and he's upset without understanding, he might be. Since the question is from the husband's point of view, the community might side with him not being in the wrong if the situation was about being excluded without explanation. Alternatively, if the wife had a valid reason, he might be. \n\nGiven the information, I'm leaning towards the husband not being in the wrong (B) because the wife's decision to exclude him without a clear reason could be seen as the issue. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe there's a cultural norm I'm missing where the mother reveals the gender to the father later as a surprise. If that's the case, maybe the husband is overreacting. But without knowing, it's hard. The answer might be B.\n"
