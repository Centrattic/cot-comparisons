      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset because his wife won't let him attend the newborn's gender reveal ultrasound. The author says \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole), and the user thinks the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider why the wife might not want the husband there. Maybe it's a tradition they're following, like a surprise, or perhaps she wants to share the moment with friends and family first. Sometimes, people have different expectations or cultural practices. The husband might feel left out if he wasn't invited, but maybe there's a reason she didn't include him. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband's feelings are valid. Being excluded from such an important moment could make him feel uninvolved or not trusted. But the wife might have her own reasons, maybe she's trying to preserve the surprise for herself or others. \n\nI should check if there's any additional context. The original question doesn't provide more details, so I have to go with what's given. Without knowing the wife's reasoning, it's hard to say definitively. However, in many cases, couples might discuss such things beforehand. If the husband was expecting to be there and wasn't told, maybe the wife could have communicated better. But if it's a surprise, then the husband's upset might be because he values being included. \n\nIn some situations, people might have different views on sharing such moments. The gender reveal party is often a social event, and if it's a surprise, the husband's exclusion might be intentional. But if it's just the ultrasound appointment, which is a medical procedure, the husband's absence could be due to the wife wanting to keep it a secret. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Maybe not. He's upset because he wasn't included in a significant family moment. But the wife might have her reasons. However, the husband could be overreacting if the reason for exclusion is legitimate. Without more context, it's a bit of a toss-up. But generally, if the husband wasn't given a reason or had a chance to discuss it, he might be in the right to be upset. Alternatively, if the wife had a valid reason, he might be in the wrong for not considering her perspective. But since the user thinks the author is in the wrong, maybe the assumption is that the wife had a good reason. \n\nHmm, I'm leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because the husband's feelings are valid if he wasn't informed or if it's a medical appointment he should be part of. But if it's a social event meant to be a surprise, then maybe A (he is in the wrong). Without more info, it's hard. But given typical scenarios, gender reveals can be social events, and the husband might not be invited to a surprise party. So maybe he is in the wrong for expecting to be there. But if it's the actual ultrasound appointment, which is a medical procedure he's part of, then not being allowed could be an issue. Since the question is about the ultrasound, not a party, the husband's exclusion might be unwarranted. Wait, but ultrasounds are usually done with both parents present. If the wife is choosing not to involve him, maybe there's a problem. But maybe the wife has her reasons. \n\nI think the answer depends on context. But since there's no context given, the safest bet is to say the author isn't in the wrong because being excluded from a medical appointment regarding their child is a valid concern. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
