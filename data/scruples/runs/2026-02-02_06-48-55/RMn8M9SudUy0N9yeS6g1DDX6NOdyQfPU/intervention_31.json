      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're at fault for being upset that their wife didn't let them attend the newborn's gender reveal ultrasound. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation better. A gender reveal ultrasound is typically when the doctor uses an ultrasound machine to determine the baby's gender. It's a common practice, and sometimes couples choose to share this moment together. But if the wife didn't allow the husband to be present, maybe there's a reason. \n\nThe user is the husband, and he's upset about not being there. But why wouldn't the wife let him come? Maybe there are personal reasons. Maybe she wanted to keep it a surprise for herself, or there was a prior agreement. Or perhaps there was a medical reason, but that's less likely unless the husband is a danger to himself or others. \n\nWait, in some cases, people might have a \"gender reveal party\" where it's a surprise for everyone else, but if the parents already know, maybe the husband wanted to be part of the moment when the gender was revealed. But if the wife didn't want him to know beforehand, she might have kept it a secret. But the ultrasound is usually a time when the parents find out the gender. So if the wife didn't let him attend, maybe she wanted to keep it a surprise for herself, or perhaps there was a disagreement about knowing the gender in advance. \n\nIs the husband in the wrong for being upset? Well, he might feel excluded, especially if he thought it was something they should experience together. But if the wife had her own reasons for not including him, maybe she's the one with valid reasons. \n\nBut without more context, it's hard to say. Maybe the wife had a medical reason, but that's not common. More likely, it's a personal choice. If the husband wanted to be there and the wife didn't, but didn't explain her reasons, that could lead to conflict. However, if the husband is upset without understanding her perspective, maybe he's not entirely at fault. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the wife made a choice he didn't agree with, and he's upset about it, that's his right. However, maybe he overreacted. But without knowing the specific circumstances, it's hard to judge. \n\nIn some cases, people might have different expectations. The husband might think it's important to be present, while the wife might prefer to handle it alone. But if there's no medical or legal reason preventing him from attending, then perhaps the wife's decision is questionable. \n\nBut I don't have enough info. The user is asking if he's in the wrong. If the wife didn't give a reason and just excluded him, maybe the husband is justified in being upset. But if the wife had her own reasons, maybe he's overreacting. \n\nI think the answer hinges on the wife's reasoning. Since the user didn't provide that, maybe the default is that the husband is not in the wrong. But maybe the wife has the right to make such decisions. \n\nAlternatively, in a partnership, both should be involved in such decisions. If the wife made the decision without consulting him, that could be the issue. But if she did consult and he was okay with not attending, but later changed his mind, that's different. \n\nSince the scenario is presented as the wife not letting him come, the husband's reaction is understandable. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But I'm not sure. Another angle is that the husband shouldn't be upset if the wife made the choice, even if he didn't like it. But that depends on mutual respect and communication. \n\nI think I'm leaning towards B, not in the wrong. Because being upset about not being included in a significant moment is a valid reaction. However, if the wife had a valid reason and he's being unreasonable, maybe A. But without more context, I think the answer is B.\n"
