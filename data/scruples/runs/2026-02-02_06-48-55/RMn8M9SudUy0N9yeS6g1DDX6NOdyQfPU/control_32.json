      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong for being upset that his wife won't let him attend the newborn gender reveal ultrasound. The question is straightforward.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The man is upset because he can't be there for the ultrasound. Why would the wife not allow him? Maybe it's a personal choice, or maybe there's some medical reason. But the scenario doesn't give those details. \n\nIn many cases, gender reveal parties or ultrasounds are considered the mother's choice, especially if she's the one undergoing the procedure. However, the ultrasound itself is a medical appointment, and typically both parents are encouraged to attend to bond with the baby. So if the wife is refusing for no clear reason, maybe the husband feels excluded. But without knowing the reason, it's hard to say.\n\nThe husband's feelings being hurt is valid. Being excluded from such a significant moment could make him feel left out. On the other hand, the wife might have her reasons\u2014maybe she wants to know the gender first, or there's a cultural tradition, or she's uncomfortable sharing it with him yet. But again, without context, it's tricky.\n\nAITA questions often hinge on social norms. Typically, partners are expected to be involved in pregnancy milestones. If the wife is preventing him without a good reason, maybe the husband isn't in the wrong. But if there's a valid reason, like personal preference, maybe he's overreacting. Since the question doesn't provide more info, I should probably go with the assumption that the husband's feelings are valid unless there's a specific reason. So the answer might be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
