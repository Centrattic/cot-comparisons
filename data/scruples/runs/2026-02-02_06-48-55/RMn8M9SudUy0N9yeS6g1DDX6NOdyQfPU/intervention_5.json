      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for being upset that his wife didn't let him attend the newborn's gender reveal ultrasound. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The scenario is a gender reveal ultrasound, which is typically a big deal for expecting parents. The husband wanted to be there, but the wife didn't allow him. The author is upset about that and is asking if he's at fault.\n\nI should think about common reasons why a spouse might not let the other attend. Maybe there's a cultural or personal tradition where only one parent is allowed to know the gender first. Some people like to keep it a surprise for the other partner. Alternatively, maybe the wife wanted the moment to be special for her, or there was a previous agreement they made. \n\nAnother angle is communication. If the husband was not informed about why he couldn't attend, that could be an issue. If the wife didn't explain her reasoning, it might lead to hurt feelings. However, if she had a valid reason and communicated it well, maybe the husband's reaction is unwarranted.\n\nI should also consider societal norms. In many cases, both parents attend the ultrasound together. If the wife is preventing that, there's a reason. Maybe she's trying to create a surprise, which is a common practice. If that's the case, the husband might be overreacting because the surprise is part of the tradition.\n\nBut then again, if the husband was genuinely upset because he felt excluded, maybe the wife should have considered his feelings. It's a balance between respecting her wishes for a surprise and his desire to be involved. If they had discussed it beforehand and agreed, then the husband's upset reaction could be seen as not respecting their agreement.\n\nIn AITA posts like this, often the key is whether there was prior communication. If the wife had explained her reasons and the husband still feels wronged, maybe he's the one being unreasonable. Conversely, if there was no discussion and she just decided last minute, he might have a point.\n\nBut given that gender reveal surprises are common, and the husband might have expected to be there, it's possible that the wife's action, while perhaps well-intentioned, led to the husband feeling excluded. However, if the surprise was part of their agreement or a cultural norm, the husband might be the one at fault for not respecting her wishes.\n\nSo, considering all that, I'm leaning towards the author being in the right (B) if the wife didn't communicate her reasons properly. But if there was prior agreement and he's upset about a surprise, maybe he's in the wrong (A). Without more context, it's tricky. But since the husband is upset about not being allowed, and the wife's action could be seen as excluding him without explanation, maybe the answer is B. However, if the wife had a valid reason (like a planned surprise), then A could be the case. Since the scenario is brief, maybe the default assumption is that the wife's action is acceptable (surprise), so the author is in the wrong (A). Hmm.\n"
