      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that his wife won't let him attend the newborn's gender reveal ultrasound. The title says \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole), so the user wants to know if the author is at fault here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the circumstances. The author is a father-to-be, and the gender reveal ultrasound is a significant event. Typically, both parents might want to be present for such a moment. But the wife is the one receiving the ultrasound, so there might be medical reasons why she's the one present. However, that doesn't mean the husband can't be there unless there's a specific reason.\n\nPossible angles: The wife could have her own reasons for not wanting him there. Maybe she's uncomfortable, or there was a past issue, or maybe the doctor's protocol doesn't include partners. But without more context, it's hard to say. The author is upset because he wanted to be there, which is understandable. If there's no valid reason for excluding him, then maybe the wife is being unreasonable. But if there is a reason, like medical advice or personal discomfort, then the author's upset might be misplaced.\n\nBut the key here is the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. Without more context, like the wife's reasons, it's hard to judge. However, the question is from the husband's perspective. In many cases, partners expect to be included in such events. If the wife is preventing him without a valid reason, then the author isn't in the wrong. But if there's a medical or personal reason, maybe the author is being unreasonable.\n\nWait, but the user hasn't provided any additional context beyond the title. So the answer might depend on common scenarios. In most cases, unless there's a specific reason, both parents attend. So if the wife is keeping him away without a good reason, the author isn't in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). But I need to be careful here. Sometimes in AITA scenarios, people get called out for being upset over things that are the other person's prerogative. However, in this case, the author's desire to be present is a reasonable one. Unless the wife has a valid reason, which isn't stated, the author's upset is justified. So the answer is B.\n"
