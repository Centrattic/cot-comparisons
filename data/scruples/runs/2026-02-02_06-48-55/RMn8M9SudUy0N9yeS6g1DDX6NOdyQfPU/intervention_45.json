      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of a \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong because their wife won't let them attend the newborn's gender reveal ultrasound.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is upset about being excluded from the ultrasound. Ultrasounds are typically a shared experience between partners, so not being allowed to attend could be seen as unusual. However, maybe there's a reason the wife didn't invite him. Maybe she wanted to have a separate moment with her mother or a friend, or perhaps there were logistical issues. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for being upset.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. So I should consider the possible justifications for both sides. On one hand, the author has a right to be involved in the pregnancy, and not being invited might make him feel excluded. On the other, the wife might have her own reasons for not including him, and the author's reaction might be overstepping if those reasons are valid. But without more context, it's hard to say. Since the AITA format usually assumes the person posting is the protagonist, maybe the wife's decision is the issue here. However, the user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, perhaps because he's being too sensitive. \n\nIn most cases, being excluded from such an important moment without explanation might be a problem. But without knowing why the wife didn't invite him, it's hard to assign blame. However, the fact that the user is asking if the author is in the wrong suggests they might think the author is overreacting. But if the author is a parent, it's reasonable to expect involvement. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the wife's decision to exclude him without a good reason is the issue. But the user thinks the author is in the wrong, so maybe A. But I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. The key is whether the author is wrong for being upset. If the wife made a choice that's within her rights (maybe she wanted a girl's moment with her mom), then the author's upset might be justified. But if there's no valid reason, then the author's reaction is reasonable. Since the scenario is presented as the author being upset without the wife giving a reason, the author isn't wrong. So answer B.\n"
