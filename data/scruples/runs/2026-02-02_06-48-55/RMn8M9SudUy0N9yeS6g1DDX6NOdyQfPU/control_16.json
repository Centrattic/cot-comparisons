      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for being upset because his wife won't let him come to the newborn's gender reveal ultrasound. The question is AITA (Am I The Asshole) style, so they want to know if they're the one being unreasonable here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The husband wants to be present at the ultrasound to reveal the baby's gender, but the wife is refusing. The husband is upset about this. Now, the possible reasons for the wife's refusal could vary. Maybe she wants to keep it a surprise for the gender reveal party, or perhaps she's uncomfortable with him being there. It's not specified in the question, so I have to assume general scenarios.\n\nIn many cases, gender reveals are done as a fun event for family and friends to find out the gender at once, often during a party. If the ultrasound was scheduled as part of that plan, the husband might not be in the wrong for wanting to be there, but the wife's decision to exclude him could be based on her preferences. However, if the husband isn't being included in the decision-making or if there's a valid reason for his concern, like feeling left out, that's another angle.\n\nBut the key point here is whether the husband is being unreasonable. If the wife has a legitimate reason, like wanting to maintain the surprise for the party, then the husband's upset could be seen as not understanding her decision. On the other hand, if he feels it's important for him to be present and there's no overriding reason, maybe the wife is being unreasonable. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Since the husband is the one expressing being upset over not being allowed, and the wife's perspective isn't detailed, but typically, in such scenarios, the spouse's request to keep it a surprise is common. So the husband might be in the wrong if the wife has a valid reason and he's not respecting her choice. But without more context, it's tricky. The general AITA community often looks for mutual respect and understanding. If the husband is being upset over not being allowed to an event where the gender is revealed, and if the wife has her reasons, maybe the husband isn't in the wrong if his reasons are about wanting to be involved. Wait, but if the ultrasound is part of a private decision, like the wife just wants to know the gender herself and not tell others yet, then maybe the husband's objection is valid. But if it's a planned gender reveal party and the wife is keeping it a secret from the husband, that's different. However, in the scenario given, the husband is not being allowed to the ultrasound, which is the actual medical appointment. So, typically, in a medical setting, both parents are usually present, unless there's a specific reason. So if the wife is preventing him from attending, that might be the issue. But the husband is upset because he's being excluded. If the wife's reason is trivial, then the husband is right to be upset. However, if the wife has her reasons, like wanting to know the gender alone, the husband might be in the wrong for not respecting her choice. Since the question is minimal and the context is limited, the answer would depend on common situations. Gender reveals are often about sharing the news with family and friends in a planned way, but the husband is a parent. So if the ultrasound is just to know the gender, and the wife is keeping him out, that's more problematic. But if it's a party and she's not allowing him because she wants it to be a surprise for others, but not for him, then maybe not. But the scenario says \"our newborn gender reveal ultrasound,\" so it's a family event where the gender is being revealed. In that case, the husband being excluded might be the issue. However, maybe the wife is doing it for a specific reason. But without more context, the typical answer would lean towards the husband being in the wrong if he's upset over not being allowed to attend a decision that's part of a planned surprise. Wait, but if the ultrasound is just a medical procedure to know the gender, and the husband is a parent, it's usually his right to be present. So if the wife is keeping him out without a good reason, that's the problem. But the husband is the one being upset, so if he's being unreasonable in expecting to be there, then he's the asshole. Hmm. The answer might depend on the intention. If the wife is planning a surprise, that's common. But the husband's right to be present is important. So maybe the husband is not in the wrong if the wife is excluding him without a valid reason. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The author is the husband. If the wife is planning a gender reveal party and the ultrasound is part of that, then not allowing him to attend could be reasonable to maintain the surprise. But if the ultrasound is just to know the gender and the husband wants to be there, but the wife is keeping him out, that could be the wife's issue. Since the question is about the husband's perspective, and the AITA community would look at both sides, but in this case, the husband's side is that he's upset because his wife won't let him come. The wife's side is not given. In a typical scenario where the gender is being revealed at the ultrasound, and the husband is a parent, the wife's refusal might be seen as unreasonable. But if the wife has her reasons, like wanting to keep it a secret for others, but not for him, then the husband's upset is valid. However, if the ultrasound is the actual point where they find out, and the wife is not allowing him to be present, that could be a problem. So in this case, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the husband has a right to be present at the ultrasound as a parent, and the wife's refusal without a valid reason would make her the one in the wrong. But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, maybe the husband is overreacting if the wife just wants to plan a surprise. Wait, but the ultrasound is a medical appointment. The husband should be allowed to attend unless there's a medical reason. So the wife's decision to exclude him might be the issue here, making the author not in the wrong. So the answer would be B.\n"
