      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong because their wife won't let them attend the newborn's gender reveal ultrasound. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is upset that they can't attend the ultrasound. The wife is the one making the decision here. Now, gender reveal ultrasounds are typically a significant moment for parents, and usually, both parents go together. But maybe there's a reason the wife doesn't want the husband there? Like, maybe it's a surprise for him? Or perhaps there's a medical reason?\n\nWait, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. If the wife made the decision, maybe the author is overreacting? Or maybe they have a valid reason to be upset. It's a common scenario, and sometimes one parent might want to keep the gender a surprise. In that case, the husband's reaction might be seen as not respecting the wife's wishes. But on the other hand, if the husband felt strongly about being there, maybe the wife should consider his feelings. But in most cases, the choice to keep it a surprise is the wife's to make, especially if it's her body and the pregnancy. So maybe the author is in the wrong because he's upset about something the wife decided for personal reasons. But I'm not sure. It's a bit of a gray area. I think the answer would depend on the context, but since the question is presented as a TITA (This Is The Agony Aunt situation), the typical answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong if the wife is being unreasonable. Hmm. Wait, but in many cases, if a parent wants to keep the gender a surprise, the other parent should respect that. So if the wife chose to keep it a surprise, the husband's reaction of being upset might be seen as not respecting her choice. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because he's upset about a decision his wife made. Alternatively, if the husband felt it was important to be there, maybe the wife isn't considering his feelings. But generally, the gender reveal is a personal choice, so the answer might be B (not in the wrong) if the husband's feelings are valid. I'm a bit torn here. Maybe the answer is B because it's a personal choice, but the wife's decision is final. Wait, no, maybe the author is in the wrong because he's not respecting the wife's decision. But if the husband was genuinely expecting to be there and it's causing distress, maybe the wife should have communicated better. I'm not sure. Maybe the answer is B. Let me check similar TITA situations. Often, if someone is upset about a partner keeping a surprise, it's considered not the one's fault because the partner made the choice. So maybe the answer is A. Wait, but if the husband was not involved in the decision-making and it's causing him distress, maybe it's not his fault. This is confusing. I think the key point is whether the husband's distress is justified. If the wife made the choice, then the husband's reaction might be seen as not respecting her decision, making him in the wrong. So answer A. Alternatively, if the husband's feelings are valid, answer B. Hmm. I think in most cases, the answer would be B because the husband has a right to be involved in the pregnancy decisions. But if the wife had a reason to keep it a surprise, then the husband might be in the wrong for being upset. But I'm not certain. I'll go with B, because the husband is upset about a decision that the wife made, and unless there was prior agreement, he's not necessarily in the wrong. Wait, but if the wife decided and he's upset, maybe he's in the wrong. I'm really torn here. Maybe the answer is B. Let me think again. In a relationship, both partners should communicate their needs. If the wife decided to keep it a surprise and the husband didn't know, maybe the husband is in the wrong for being upset. But if the husband felt it was important to be there, maybe the wife should have discussed it. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the wife made the choice, and the husband is upset about it, then the author is not in the wrong. Wait, but if the husband was expecting to be there and the wife didn't communicate that, maybe he's not in the wrong. Alternatively, if the wife had a reason to keep it a surprise, the author is in the wrong. Since the question doesn't give more context, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong), because the husband's feelings are valid. But I'm not sure. In many TITA questions, if someone is upset about a partner keeping a surprise, the answer is that they're not in the wrong if they didn't know. So maybe B is correct. Alternatively, if the husband should have respected the wife's decision, then A. Hmm. I think the answer is B. The husband is not in the wrong for being upset if the wife didn't inform him about the surprise. But if the wife had already decided to keep it a surprise, maybe the husband is in the wrong. Since the scenario is brief, the answer is probably B. So I'll go with B.\n"
