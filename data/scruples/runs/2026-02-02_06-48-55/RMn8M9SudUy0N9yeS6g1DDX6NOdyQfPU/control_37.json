      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset that his wife didn't let him come to the newborn's gender reveal ultrasound. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both perspectives. The husband is upset because he wasn't allowed to attend the ultrasound, which is a significant moment for a couple expecting a child. On the other hand, the wife might have had her reasons for not including him. Maybe she wanted to surprise him, or perhaps there was a medical reason, like the ultrasound being scheduled during a time when he couldn't attend due to work or other commitments. Alternatively, maybe the wife felt more comfortable going alone, or the healthcare provider only allowed one parent to be present.\n\nI should think about societal norms and expectations. Traditionally, both parents might expect to be involved in such events, but there's also the aspect of personal choice. The wife might have made a decision based on her own preferences or circumstances. It's also possible there's some underlying issue here, like past experiences or communication problems in the relationship.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual understanding. If the husband felt excluded, it's important that they discuss their feelings. However, the wife might have had valid reasons that the husband wasn't aware of. Without more context, it's hard to say definitively, but the question is whether the husband is in the wrong.\n\nFrom a general perspective, being upset about not being included in a significant event could be seen as a reasonable reaction, especially if there was no prior explanation. However, if the wife had a legitimate reason and communicated it, the husband might be in the wrong for being upset. Since the scenario is presented as the husband being upset without context, it's possible that the wife's decision was unilateral, leading to his frustration.\n\nBut without knowing why she didn't let him come, it's hard to assign blame. Maybe she wanted to keep it a secret for a surprise, which is a common practice. Or perhaps there was a logistical reason. The husband's reaction might be justified if he felt excluded without reason. Alternatively, if the wife made a decision that the husband respected, then his upset reaction would be unwarranted.\n\nIn summary, without additional context, the answer might depend on typical scenarios. In many cases, couples do attend ultrasounds together, so the wife's decision might be seen as unusual. However, if she had a good reason, like wanting to keep the gender a surprise, then the husband might be in the wrong for being upset. But again, if there was no explanation given, the husband's reaction is more understandable. Since the question is whether he's in the wrong, and the answer options are A or B, I need to decide based on common situations.\n\nConsidering that gender reveals are often surprises, maybe the wife had a valid reason. However, if the husband was not informed, then he's not in the wrong for being upset. So the answer could be B (No), but I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, if the wife had a reason and didn't communicate it, the husband might be in the wrong. It's a bit of a toss-up. Given the lack of context, the default would be to say that the husband is not in the wrong because being excluded from a significant event without explanation is valid for being upset. So I'll go with B.\n"
