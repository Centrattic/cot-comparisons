      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that his wife didn't let him come to the newborn's gender reveal ultrasound.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a husband who wanted to attend the ultrasound but his wife said no. He's upset about it. The question is whether he's at fault here.\n\nI should consider the context. Gender reveal ultrasounds are common, and some couples prefer to keep the gender a surprise. Maybe the wife wanted to surprise the husband, so she didn't let him attend. That could be a reason. But why would the husband be upset? Maybe he felt excluded or wanted to share the moment. \n\nIs there any cultural or social norm here? In some cases, one parent might choose to surprise the other. If the wife had already decided not to tell him, then not allowing him to attend makes sense. However, if the husband found out later that he wasn't allowed, he might feel left out. \n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. If the wife made a choice that the husband didn't agree with, but it's her decision, then maybe the husband is overreacting. On the other hand, if the couple had an understanding to share such moments, then the wife might have overstepped. \n\nThe key here is the reason why the wife didn't let him attend. If it was to keep the gender a secret, then it's a common practice. The husband's upset might be due to not being informed beforehand or feeling excluded. However, the wife's reasoning could be valid. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, if the husband was unaware of the surprise, then he might not be in the wrong for being upset. But if the wife had already planned a surprise, then maybe the husband's reaction is a bit unreasonable. \n\nI think the answer leans more towards the author not being in the wrong (B), but it's a bit situational. However, the question is a yes or no based on the given information. Since the wife's decision to keep it a secret is a valid reason, but the husband's upset is also understandable, it's a bit of a gray area. But traditionally, in such scenarios, the surprise aspect is respected, so maybe the husband is in the wrong for being upset. Wait, no, if the husband wasn't aware of the surprise, then he's not in the wrong. But if the wife had already planned it, then he might be overreacting. Hmm. \n\nI think the answer is B because the wife had her own reasons, and the husband's feelings are valid. It's not necessarily his fault to be upset. So the answer is B.\n"
