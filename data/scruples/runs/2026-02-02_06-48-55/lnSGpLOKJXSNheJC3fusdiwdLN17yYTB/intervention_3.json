I usually go in around 6 or 7 and I'm out by 9ish. With the new time change and my fiancee getting a new job it has thrown me off a bit so I have been going to the gym later. \n\nMy gym pretty much consists of the elderly (I'm 25 myself) with a few other gym goers my age. Now I go to the gym alone as I like having some quiet time and it's a good stress reliever for me. I also wanna add that I keep to myself. I dont talk to anyone or bother myself with other people because I just get in my own head. The reason I add this is because many of the older gym goers like to chat and hangout even when I would normally go at 7am. I really dont mind this aa they dont take up any gym equipment and are pleasant as far as I can tell. Now obviously since I'm at the gym a few hours later then I normally go a few people I dont normally see are here but I assume them to be locals but again I dont concern myself with others.\n\n\nSo now to the cause of me feeling like a asshole. I was doing cardio on the bike with my headphones in zoned out. A group of 2 elderly ladies and 2 eldery gentlemen are biking and chatting next to me I glance over and see they are passing panflets with \"Jesus will save you\" and such back and forth and one elderly gentleman has a vanilla envelope I assume full of them. Whatever right? Not bugging me and they all seemed happy and knew eachother. They walk away and I continue peddling along. After about 5 mins I feel a tap on my shoulder and it is one of the elderly ladies. With a big smile on her face she tries to hand me a panflit, I  shake my head and say \"no thank you\" and face forward again. She then taps me again and motions for me to take my headphones off. I do and say, a little for annoyed, \"yes?\" She then says \"you should take this hun, you look like you need saving\" . I was pretty shocked but responded with \" I dont need anything thing from you maam\" and put my headphone back in. \n\n\nNow i thought that would be it but not 2 mins later she comes back with 2 of the older gentleman. They tap me on the shoulder again and berate me for being rude and not accepting the lords light into me and how I should be ashamed blah blah blah. I dont get to say anything before they walk away. I do however go right to the front desk and ask to speak to a manager.\n\nI explained to her exactly what happened and how it was pretty shocking and if something could be said to them so it doesn't happen again. She then informs her this isnt the first time it has been reported and let's me know she will handle it. I walk out and go back to my bike. She then comes out, gathers the 3 people who spoke to me, old lady included, and kicks them out. \n\nThey actually start pleading and apologizing and looked genuinely upset. I heard them offer to apologize but the manager had none of it. I now feel awful and didnt mean to have them kicked out or worse AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for getting a group of elderly people kicked out of the gym after they tried to give him religious pamphlets.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author goes to the gym late, which is when more elderly people are present. He values his quiet time and usually keeps to himself. The group of elderly individuals was passing out religious materials and approached him twice, even after he declined. The author then complained to the manager, leading to their removal.\n\nNow, thinking about the situation from different angles. The elderly people were distributing religious materials, which might be within the gym's policies or not. If the gym has a policy against solicitation, then the author might have followed the rules correctly. However, if the gym allows such activities, then the author's reaction could be seen as overstepping.\n\nThe key points are: Did the elderly people violate any gym policies? The manager mentioned this wasn't the first report, implying there might be a policy in place. If the author reported the incident because it was against the rules, then he's acting appropriately. However, if the gym allows such activities, then the author's actions might be seen as interfering with their free expression.\n\nAlso, the elderly people were persistent after the author declined, which could be seen as harassment if it wasn't allowed. The author's right to a quiet environment at the gym is valid. However, the method of resolving it by involving management might be necessary if the gym's rules support it.\n\nOn the other hand, the elderly individuals might have been within their rights to distribute materials if the gym permits it, even if it's annoying. The author might be in the wrong for not handling it in a more personal way, like ignoring them further, before escalating.\n\nBut considering that the manager already addressed it and it's a repeated issue, the author is following proper channels. The elderly people's actions could be seen as disruptive, and the author's complaint is justified to maintain a respectful environment for himself and others.\n\nSo, the author's actions were in line with gym policies and his right to a harassment-free environment. Therefore, he's not in the wrong.\n"
