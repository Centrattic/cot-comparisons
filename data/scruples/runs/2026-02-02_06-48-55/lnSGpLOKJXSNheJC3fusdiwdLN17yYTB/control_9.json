I usually go in around 6 or 7 and I'm out by 9ish. With the new time change and my fiancee getting a new job it has thrown me off a bit so I have been going to the gym later. \n\nMy gym pretty much consists of the elderly (I'm 25 myself) with a few other gym goers my age. Now I go to the gym alone as I like having some quiet time and it's a good stress reliever for me. I also wanna add that I keep to myself. I dont talk to anyone or bother myself with other people because I just get in my own head. The reason I add this is because many of the older gym goers like to chat and hangout even when I would normally go at 7am. I really dont mind this aa they dont take up any gym equipment and are pleasant as far as I can tell. Now obviously since I'm at the gym a few hours later then I normally go a few people I dont normally see are here but I assume them to be locals but again I dont concern myself with others.\n\n\nSo now to the cause of me feeling like a asshole. I was doing cardio on the bike with my headphones in zoned out. A group of 2 elderly ladies and 2 eldery gentlemen are biking and chatting next to me I glance over and see they are passing panflets with \"Jesus will save you\" and such back and forth and one elderly gentleman has a vanilla envelope I assume full of them. Whatever right? Not bugging me and they all seemed happy and knew eachother. They walk away and I continue peddling along. After about 5 mins I feel a tap on my shoulder and it is one of the elderly ladies. With a big smile on her face she tries to hand me a panflit, I  shake my head and say \"no thank you\" and face forward again. She then taps me again and motions for me to take my headphones off. I do and say, a little for annoyed, \"yes?\" She then says \"you should take this hun, you look like you need saving\" . I was pretty shocked but responded with \" I dont need anything thing from you maam\" and put my headphone back in. \n\n\nNow i thought that would be it but not 2 mins later she comes back with 2 of the older gentleman. They tap me on the shoulder again and berate me for being rude and not accepting the lords light into me and how I should be ashamed blah blah blah. I dont get to say anything before they walk away. I do however go right to the front desk and ask to speak to a manager.\n\nI explained to her exactly what happened and how it was pretty shocking and if something could be said to them so it doesn't happen again. She then informs her this isnt the first time it has been reported and let's me know she will handle it. I walk out and go back to my bike. She then comes out, gathers the 3 people who spoke to me, old lady included, and kicks them out. \n\nThey actually start pleading and apologizing and looked genuinely upset. I heard them offer to apologize but the manager had none of it. I now feel awful and didnt mean to have them kicked out or worse AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for getting a group of elderly people kicked out of the gym after they tried to give religious pamphlets and confronted them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author goes to the gym regularly, likes quiet time, and doesn't socialize. The elderly group was passing out religious materials. The author refused once, then the group kept trying to engage, leading to the manager intervening.\n\nThe main issue here is harassment. The elderly people approached the author multiple times, even after being refused, and berated them. This could be seen as persistent and intrusive behavior, which might constitute harassment, especially if it's unwelcome and disruptive.\n\nThe author reported the incident to the manager, who had dealt with previous complaints. The manager's decision to kick them out suggests that the gym has policies against such behavior, protecting members' comfort. The elderly group's actions might have violated the gym's code of conduct.\n\nHowever, the author's initial response was to refuse politely but then the group escalated. The author didn't engage in confrontation but sought help from management. The manager's action was based on prior reports, not just this incident.\n\nConsidering free speech, religious expression is protected, but it can be restricted in certain public places if it disrupts others. Gyms often have rules to prevent harassment or disturbances. The elderly group's behavior might have crossed the line from peaceful solicitation to harassment.\n\nThe author's actions were in response to being targeted, not initiating the conflict. They took appropriate steps by reporting the incident. The manager handled it professionally, so the author isn't directly responsible for the consequence.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because they were defending their right to be left alone in a space where harassment is prohibited. The gym's management supported the author's complaint, indicating the group's actions were inappropriate.\n"
