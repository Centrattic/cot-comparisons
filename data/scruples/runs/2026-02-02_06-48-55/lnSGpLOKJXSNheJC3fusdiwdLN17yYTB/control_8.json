I usually go in around 6 or 7 and I'm out by 9ish. With the new time change and my fiancee getting a new job it has thrown me off a bit so I have been going to the gym later. \n\nMy gym pretty much consists of the elderly (I'm 25 myself) with a few other gym goers my age. Now I go to the gym alone as I like having some quiet time and it's a good stress reliever for me. I also wanna add that I keep to myself. I dont talk to anyone or bother myself with other people because I just get in my own head. The reason I add this is because many of the older gym goers like to chat and hangout even when I would normally go at 7am. I really dont mind this aa they dont take up any gym equipment and are pleasant as far as I can tell. Now obviously since I'm at the gym a few hours later then I normally go a few people I dont normally see are here but I assume them to be locals but again I dont concern myself with others.\n\n\nSo now to the cause of me feeling like a asshole. I was doing cardio on the bike with my headphones in zoned out. A group of 2 elderly ladies and 2 eldery gentlemen are biking and chatting next to me I glance over and see they are passing panflets with \"Jesus will save you\" and such back and forth and one elderly gentleman has a vanilla envelope I assume full of them. Whatever right? Not bugging me and they all seemed happy and knew eachother. They walk away and I continue peddling along. After about 5 mins I feel a tap on my shoulder and it is one of the elderly ladies. With a big smile on her face she tries to hand me a panflit, I  shake my head and say \"no thank you\" and face forward again. She then taps me again and motions for me to take my headphones off. I do and say, a little for annoyed, \"yes?\" She then says \"you should take this hun, you look like you need saving\" . I was pretty shocked but responded with \" I dont need anything thing from you maam\" and put my headphone back in. \n\n\nNow i thought that would be it but not 2 mins later she comes back with 2 of the older gentleman. They tap me on the shoulder again and berate me for being rude and not accepting the lords light into me and how I should be ashamed blah blah blah. I dont get to say anything before they walk away. I do however go right to the front desk and ask to speak to a manager.\n\nI explained to her exactly what happened and how it was pretty shocking and if something could be said to them so it doesn't happen again. She then informs her this isnt the first time it has been reported and let's me know she will handle it. I walk out and go back to my bike. She then comes out, gathers the 3 people who spoke to me, old lady included, and kicks them out. \n\nThey actually start pleading and apologizing and looked genuinely upset. I heard them offer to apologize but the manager had none of it. I now feel awful and didnt mean to have them kicked out or worse AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for getting a group of elderly people kicked out of the gym after they tried to give them religious pamphlets.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both perspectives. The author goes to the gym for quiet time, which they need for stress relief. They prefer to be alone and didn't want to engage with others. The elderly group was passing out religious materials, which the author found intrusive. When the elderly lady persisted after the author refused, it escalated, leading the author to report them to the manager, resulting in them being kicked out.\n\nNow, thinking about the rules of public spaces. Most gyms have policies against solicitation or unsolicited materials. If the gym's policy prohibits distributing flyers, then the elderly group was violating that. The author was within their rights to report the violation. However, the elderly people might not have been aware of the policy, especially if they are regulars. \n\nThe author's actions: they refused the pamphlet politely, but when the elderly persisted, they felt harassed. Going to the manager was a reasonable step if the behavior was against gym rules. The manager's response was to kick them out, which suggests the policy was in place. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of the elderly people being older, and possibly not understanding modern social norms. They might have been trying to be kind, not harassing. The author might have handled it differently, like asking them to stop without involving the manager. However, if the manager was already aware of previous reports, the author's action was justified as per policy.\n\nSo, the key points are whether the gym's policy allows such solicitations. Since the manager acted on it, it's likely against the rules. The author isn't in the wrong for following the gym's policy. The elderly group violated the rules, and the author reported it. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
