I usually go in around 6 or 7 and I'm out by 9ish. With the new time change and my fiancee getting a new job it has thrown me off a bit so I have been going to the gym later. \n\nMy gym pretty much consists of the elderly (I'm 25 myself) with a few other gym goers my age. Now I go to the gym alone as I like having some quiet time and it's a good stress reliever for me. I also wanna add that I keep to myself. I dont talk to anyone or bother myself with other people because I just get in my own head. The reason I add this is because many of the older gym goers like to chat and hangout even when I would normally go at 7am. I really dont mind this aa they dont take up any gym equipment and are pleasant as far as I can tell. Now obviously since I'm at the gym a few hours later then I normally go a few people I dont normally see are here but I assume them to be locals but again I dont concern myself with others.\n\n\nSo now to the cause of me feeling like a asshole. I was doing cardio on the bike with my headphones in zoned out. A group of 2 elderly ladies and 2 eldery gentlemen are biking and chatting next to me I glance over and see they are passing panflets with \"Jesus will save you\" and such back and forth and one elderly gentleman has a vanilla envelope I assume full of them. Whatever right? Not bugging me and they all seemed happy and knew eachother. They walk away and I continue peddling along. After about 5 mins I feel a tap on my shoulder and it is one of the elderly ladies. With a big smile on her face she tries to hand me a panflit, I  shake my head and say \"no thank you\" and face forward again. She then taps me again and motions for me to take my headphones off. I do and say, a little for annoyed, \"yes?\" She then says \"you should take this hun, you look like you need saving\" . I was pretty shocked but responded with \" I dont need anything thing from you maam\" and put my headphone back in. \n\n\nNow i thought that would be it but not 2 mins later she comes back with 2 of the older gentleman. They tap me on the shoulder again and berate me for being rude and not accepting the lords light into me and how I should be ashamed blah blah blah. I dont get to say anything before they walk away. I do however go right to the front desk and ask to speak to a manager.\n\nI explained to her exactly what happened and how it was pretty shocking and if something could be said to them so it doesn't happen again. She then informs her this isnt the first time it has been reported and let's me know she will handle it. I walk out and go back to my bike. She then comes out, gathers the 3 people who spoke to me, old lady included, and kicks them out. \n\nThey actually start pleading and apologizing and looked genuinely upset. I heard them offer to apologize but the manager had none of it. I now feel awful and didnt mean to have them kicked out or worse AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author going to the gym later than usual and encountering a group of elderly people who were passing out religious pamphlets. When the author refused one, the group continued to bother them, leading the author to report them to the manager, who then kicked them out.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author was at the gym, which is a public space. The elderly group was passing out literature while on the exercise bikes. The author said no to the pamphlet, but the group then confronted them, leading the author to report the incident.\n\nNow, considering the context. The gym is a place where people go to exercise, so there's an expectation of a certain level of quiet or respectful interaction. The elderly group was passing out religious material, which could be seen as a form of solicitation. Many places have policies against solicitation in their facilities. The author was not alone in reporting this, as the manager mentioned it's not the first time it's been reported. \n\nThe author's actions: they were polite but firm when refusing the pamphlet, then went to the manager after being harassed further. The manager handled it appropriately by removing the individuals. The author didn't confront them physically or verbally attack them, just sought assistance through proper channels.\n\nThe elderly group's actions: they were persistent after being refused, which could be seen as harassment if they didn't take the \"no thank you\" as a final answer. Their behavior might be violating the gym's rules about solicitation, even if they intended to be kind.\n\nThe author's feelings of guilt are understandable, especially seeing the elderly upset. However, they had the right to report harassment and have the environment managed for all members. The gym management's role is to enforce rules, so the author acted within their rights by reporting the incident.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the elderly group likely broke the rules, and the author was within their rights to report it. The manager's decision to remove them was appropriate. The author isn't in the wrong here because they used the proper channels and didn't act aggressively. So the answer should be B (not in the wrong).\n"
