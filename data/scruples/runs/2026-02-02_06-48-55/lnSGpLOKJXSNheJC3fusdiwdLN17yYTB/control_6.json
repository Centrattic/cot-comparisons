I usually go in around 6 or 7 and I'm out by 9ish. With the new time change and my fiancee getting a new job it has thrown me off a bit so I have been going to the gym later. \n\nMy gym pretty much consists of the elderly (I'm 25 myself) with a few other gym goers my age. Now I go to the gym alone as I like having some quiet time and it's a good stress reliever for me. I also wanna add that I keep to myself. I dont talk to anyone or bother myself with other people because I just get in my own head. The reason I add this is because many of the older gym goers like to chat and hangout even when I would normally go at 7am. I really dont mind this aa they dont take up any gym equipment and are pleasant as far as I can tell. Now obviously since I'm at the gym a few hours later then I normally go a few people I dont normally see are here but I assume them to be locals but again I dont concern myself with others.\n\n\nSo now to the cause of me feeling like a asshole. I was doing cardio on the bike with my headphones in zoned out. A group of 2 elderly ladies and 2 eldery gentlemen are biking and chatting next to me I glance over and see they are passing panflets with \"Jesus will save you\" and such back and forth and one elderly gentleman has a vanilla envelope I assume full of them. Whatever right? Not bugging me and they all seemed happy and knew eachother. They walk away and I continue peddling along. After about 5 mins I feel a tap on my shoulder and it is one of the elderly ladies. With a big smile on her face she tries to hand me a panflit, I  shake my head and say \"no thank you\" and face forward again. She then taps me again and motions for me to take my headphones off. I do and say, a little for annoyed, \"yes?\" She then says \"you should take this hun, you look like you need saving\" . I was pretty shocked but responded with \" I dont need anything thing from you maam\" and put my headphone back in. \n\n\nNow i thought that would be it but not 2 mins later she comes back with 2 of the older gentleman. They tap me on the shoulder again and berate me for being rude and not accepting the lords light into me and how I should be ashamed blah blah blah. I dont get to say anything before they walk away. I do however go right to the front desk and ask to speak to a manager.\n\nI explained to her exactly what happened and how it was pretty shocking and if something could be said to them so it doesn't happen again. She then informs her this isnt the first time it has been reported and let's me know she will handle it. I walk out and go back to my bike. She then comes out, gathers the 3 people who spoke to me, old lady included, and kicks them out. \n\nThey actually start pleading and apologizing and looked genuinely upset. I heard them offer to apologize but the manager had none of it. I now feel awful and didnt mean to have them kicked out or worse AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is about the author going to the gym later than usual and encountering a group of elderly people who are handing out religious pamphlets. The author tried to decline politely but then the group persisted, leading the author to report them and have them kicked out. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentioned they value their quiet time at the gym and usually keep to themselves. The elderly group was passing out religious material, which isn't a gym's primary purpose. The author tried to decline once but the group continued, which could be seen as harassment or pestering. The gym manager had already been informed of previous reports, so this might not be an isolated incident.\n\nThe author's actions were to report the behavior to the manager, who then took appropriate action. The author didn't physically harm anyone but sought a resolution through the proper channels. However, the elderly people were upset and apologized, which might suggest they didn't mean to cause trouble. But the manager's job is to maintain the gym's environment, and if the group was violating the gym's policies by proselytizing, the manager had the right to intervene.\n\nThe key points are: the author's right to a quiet environment, the group's persistent behavior after refusal, and the gym's policies. The author's actions were within their right to seek a resolution. The manager's decision to remove them was based on prior reports, so the author isn't at fault here. The answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
