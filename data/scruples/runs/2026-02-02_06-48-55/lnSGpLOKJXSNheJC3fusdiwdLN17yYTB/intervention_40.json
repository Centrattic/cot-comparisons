I usually go in around 6 or 7 and I'm out by 9ish. With the new time change and my fiancee getting a new job it has thrown me off a bit so I have been going to the gym later. \n\nMy gym pretty much consists of the elderly (I'm 25 myself) with a few other gym goers my age. Now I go to the gym alone as I like having some quiet time and it's a good stress reliever for me. I also wanna add that I keep to myself. I dont talk to anyone or bother myself with other people because I just get in my own head. The reason I add this is because many of the older gym goers like to chat and hangout even when I would normally go at 7am. I really dont mind this aa they dont take up any gym equipment and are pleasant as far as I can tell. Now obviously since I'm at the gym a few hours later then I normally go a few people I dont normally see are here but I assume them to be locals but again I dont concern myself with others.\n\n\nSo now to the cause of me feeling like a asshole. I was doing cardio on the bike with my headphones in zoned out. A group of 2 elderly ladies and 2 eldery gentlemen are biking and chatting next to me I glance over and see they are passing panflets with \"Jesus will save you\" and such back and forth and one elderly gentleman has a vanilla envelope I assume full of them. Whatever right? Not bugging me and they all seemed happy and knew eachother. They walk away and I continue peddling along. After about 5 mins I feel a tap on my shoulder and it is one of the elderly ladies. With a big smile on her face she tries to hand me a panflit, I  shake my head and say \"no thank you\" and face forward again. She then taps me again and motions for me to take my headphones off. I do and say, a little for annoyed, \"yes?\" She then says \"you should take this hun, you look like you need saving\" . I was pretty shocked but responded with \" I dont need anything thing from you maam\" and put my headphone back in. \n\n\nNow i thought that would be it but not 2 mins later she comes back with 2 of the older gentleman. They tap me on the shoulder again and berate me for being rude and not accepting the lords light into me and how I should be ashamed blah blah blah. I dont get to say anything before they walk away. I do however go right to the front desk and ask to speak to a manager.\n\nI explained to her exactly what happened and how it was pretty shocking and if something could be said to them so it doesn't happen again. She then informs her this isnt the first time it has been reported and let's me know she will handle it. I walk out and go back to my bike. She then comes out, gathers the 3 people who spoke to me, old lady included, and kicks them out. \n\nThey actually start pleading and apologizing and looked genuinely upset. I heard them offer to apologize but the manager had none of it. I now feel awful and didnt mean to have them kicked out or worse AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the writer getting a group of elderly people kicked out of the gym after they tried to give religious pamphlets and then confronted him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The writer goes to the gym regularly and likes the quiet. They mention not wanting to engage with others. Then, a group of elderly people, who are known to the gym (since the manager says it's not the first report), approach him with religious materials. The writer politely refuses, but the group persists, leading to confrontation. The manager then kicks them out.\n\nThe key points here are: Did the writer have the right to ask for the manager to intervene? The elderly people were engaging in behavior that could be seen as harassment if they were persistently approaching him without consent. The writer approached the manager to address the situation, which is a reasonable action. However, the elderly people might have been exercising their right to share their beliefs, even if it's annoying to others.\n\nBut the manager already knew about previous complaints, so maybe the group was already problematic. The writer's action led to them being removed. The writer might feel guilty because they didn't want to cause trouble, especially with elderly people. But from a rights perspective, the manager's job is to maintain a safe environment. If the group was disrupting the gym atmosphere, the manager's action was appropriate.\n\nHowever, the writer could have handled it differently. Maybe ignoring or walking away would have been better, but if the manager was aware of prior issues, intervening was necessary. The writer isn't in the wrong because they asked the manager to address harassment. The elderly group might be in the wrong for persisting and causing discomfort. So the answer is B, not in the wrong.\n"
