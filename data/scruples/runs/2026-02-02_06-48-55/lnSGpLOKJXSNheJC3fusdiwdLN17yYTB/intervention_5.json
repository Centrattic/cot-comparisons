I usually go in around 6 or 7 and I'm out by 9ish. With the new time change and my fiancee getting a new job it has thrown me off a bit so I have been going to the gym later. \n\nMy gym pretty much consists of the elderly (I'm 25 myself) with a few other gym goers my age. Now I go to the gym alone as I like having some quiet time and it's a good stress reliever for me. I also wanna add that I keep to myself. I dont talk to anyone or bother myself with other people because I just get in my own head. The reason I add this is because many of the older gym goers like to chat and hangout even when I would normally go at 7am. I really dont mind this aa they dont take up any gym equipment and are pleasant as far as I can tell. Now obviously since I'm at the gym a few hours later then I normally go a few people I dont normally see are here but I assume them to be locals but again I dont concern myself with others.\n\n\nSo now to the cause of me feeling like a asshole. I was doing cardio on the bike with my headphones in zoned out. A group of 2 elderly ladies and 2 eldery gentlemen are biking and chatting next to me I glance over and see they are passing panflets with \"Jesus will save you\" and such back and forth and one elderly gentleman has a vanilla envelope I assume full of them. Whatever right? Not bugging me and they all seemed happy and knew eachother. They walk away and I continue peddling along. After about 5 mins I feel a tap on my shoulder and it is one of the elderly ladies. With a big smile on her face she tries to hand me a panflit, I  shake my head and say \"no thank you\" and face forward again. She then taps me again and motions for me to take my headphones off. I do and say, a little for annoyed, \"yes?\" She then says \"you should take this hun, you look like you need saving\" . I was pretty shocked but responded with \" I dont need anything thing from you maam\" and put my headphone back in. \n\n\nNow i thought that would be it but not 2 mins later she comes back with 2 of the older gentleman. They tap me on the shoulder again and berate me for being rude and not accepting the lords light into me and how I should be ashamed blah blah blah. I dont get to say anything before they walk away. I do however go right to the front desk and ask to speak to a manager.\n\nI explained to her exactly what happened and how it was pretty shocking and if something could be said to them so it doesn't happen again. She then informs her this isnt the first time it has been reported and let's me know she will handle it. I walk out and go back to my bike. She then comes out, gathers the 3 people who spoke to me, old lady included, and kicks them out. \n\nThey actually start pleading and apologizing and looked genuinely upset. I heard them offer to apologize but the manager had none of it. I now feel awful and didnt mean to have them kicked out or worse AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for getting a group of elderly people kicked out of the gym after they tried to give him religious pamphlets. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author goes to the gym regularly and prefers a quiet environment. He didn't interact with others, just wanted to zone out. Then, a group of elderly people started passing out religious materials. The author tried to decline politely but they persisted, leading him to report them to management. The manager had them removed, and now the author feels bad.\n\nSo, the key points here are: right to free speech vs. harassment, persistence in solicitation, and the author's right to a safe environment. In many places, handing out religious materials in public areas, including gyms, is protected under free speech. However, if someone feels harassed or the activity becomes disruptive, it might be considered a violation of the gym's policies.\n\nThe author was annoyed and felt disrespected, leading to his complaint. But did he have the right to report them? The manager mentioned it wasn't the first time such an issue was reported, so there might be existing policies against this. The elderly group did approach him multiple times after he declined, which could be seen as persistent solicitation, which might not be allowed in the gym. \n\nHowever, the author could have handled it differently, like moving to another area or reporting after the fact without immediate removal. The elderly people seemed apologetic, so maybe the author's reaction was too harsh. But he did follow the proper procedure by going to management. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's right to a quiet workout space is valid. If the gym has rules against solicitation, then management acting on that is justified. The author's actions led to the removal, so he might be partially responsible, but if the gym's policy supports such actions, maybe he's not in the wrong. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because he reported the issue through proper channels, and the manager already knew about previous incidents. The elderly's persistence could be against gym rules, so the author's action was within his rights. Therefore, answer B.\n"
