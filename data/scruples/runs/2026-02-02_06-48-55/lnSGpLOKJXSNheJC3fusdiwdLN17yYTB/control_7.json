I usually go in around 6 or 7 and I'm out by 9ish. With the new time change and my fiancee getting a new job it has thrown me off a bit so I have been going to the gym later. \n\nMy gym pretty much consists of the elderly (I'm 25 myself) with a few other gym goers my age. Now I go to the gym alone as I like having some quiet time and it's a good stress reliever for me. I also wanna add that I keep to myself. I dont talk to anyone or bother myself with other people because I just get in my own head. The reason I add this is because many of the older gym goers like to chat and hangout even when I would normally go at 7am. I really dont mind this aa they dont take up any gym equipment and are pleasant as far as I can tell. Now obviously since I'm at the gym a few hours later then I normally go a few people I dont normally see are here but I assume them to be locals but again I dont concern myself with others.\n\n\nSo now to the cause of me feeling like a asshole. I was doing cardio on the bike with my headphones in zoned out. A group of 2 elderly ladies and 2 eldery gentlemen are biking and chatting next to me I glance over and see they are passing panflets with \"Jesus will save you\" and such back and forth and one elderly gentleman has a vanilla envelope I assume full of them. Whatever right? Not bugging me and they all seemed happy and knew eachother. They walk away and I continue peddling along. After about 5 mins I feel a tap on my shoulder and it is one of the elderly ladies. With a big smile on her face she tries to hand me a panflit, I  shake my head and say \"no thank you\" and face forward again. She then taps me again and motions for me to take my headphones off. I do and say, a little for annoyed, \"yes?\" She then says \"you should take this hun, you look like you need saving\" . I was pretty shocked but responded with \" I dont need anything thing from you maam\" and put my headphone back in. \n\n\nNow i thought that would be it but not 2 mins later she comes back with 2 of the older gentleman. They tap me on the shoulder again and berate me for being rude and not accepting the lords light into me and how I should be ashamed blah blah blah. I dont get to say anything before they walk away. I do however go right to the front desk and ask to speak to a manager.\n\nI explained to her exactly what happened and how it was pretty shocking and if something could be said to them so it doesn't happen again. She then informs her this isnt the first time it has been reported and let's me know she will handle it. I walk out and go back to my bike. She then comes out, gathers the 3 people who spoke to me, old lady included, and kicks them out. \n\nThey actually start pleading and apologizing and looked genuinely upset. I heard them offer to apologize but the manager had none of it. I now feel awful and didnt mean to have them kicked out or worse AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through their situation carefully.\n\nThey go to the gym regularly, usually in the evenings. They like quiet time and keep to themselves. Recently, they started going later because of a time change and their fianc\u00e9e's new job. The gym has a lot of elderly people, and normally, they don't bother others. But this time, a group of four elderly people were passing out religious pamphlets. The author was on the bike with headphones on when one of the ladies tried to give them a pamphlet. They politely declined, but then the group came back with more people, accused them of being rude, and tried to pressure them. The author went to the manager, who had done this before, and the group was kicked out. The author now feels bad and is wondering if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I should consider the context. The author was in their own space, using the gym facilities. They didn't initiate any interaction but were approached by the group. The key points here are about harassment and respect. The elderly people approached the author multiple times, even after being refused. They didn't just hand over a pamphlet once; they came back with others, berated the author, and tried to shame them for not accepting. That could be seen as harassment, especially since the author was trying to avoid any interaction and just wanted to work out.\n\nReligious solicitation in public places can be a tricky area. Some places have rules against this to prevent harassment. The manager's response suggests that this isn't the first time, so there's a pattern of behavior. The author didn't start the conflict; they tried to be polite, then went to the manager as a last resort. The manager handled it by removing the individuals, which might be necessary if they were violating gym policies.\n\nThe author might feel guilty because they didn't want to cause harm, but their actions were in response to being harassed. The elderly people were the ones initiating the interaction beyond what the author was comfortable with. The author's request to the manager to address the behavior seems reasonable, especially if it's a recurring issue.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author could have handled it differently, like ignoring the group or not approaching the manager. But given the situation\u2014being pressured repeatedly in a public space where they were there to work out\u2014it's understandable that they wanted to put an end to it. The manager's intervention was necessary to maintain a respectful environment for all patrons.\n\nSo, in this scenario, the author isn't in the wrong. They were defending their personal space and seeking a resolution through the appropriate channels. The elderly group was the one engaging in unwanted behavior, and the manager's action was justified. The author's actions were a response to harassment, not the cause of it.\n"
