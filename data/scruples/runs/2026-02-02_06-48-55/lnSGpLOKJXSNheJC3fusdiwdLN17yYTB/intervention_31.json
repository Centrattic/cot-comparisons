I usually go in around 6 or 7 and I'm out by 9ish. With the new time change and my fiancee getting a new job it has thrown me off a bit so I have been going to the gym later. \n\nMy gym pretty much consists of the elderly (I'm 25 myself) with a few other gym goers my age. Now I go to the gym alone as I like having some quiet time and it's a good stress reliever for me. I also wanna add that I keep to myself. I dont talk to anyone or bother myself with other people because I just get in my own head. The reason I add this is because many of the older gym goers like to chat and hangout even when I would normally go at 7am. I really dont mind this aa they dont take up any gym equipment and are pleasant as far as I can tell. Now obviously since I'm at the gym a few hours later then I normally go a few people I dont normally see are here but I assume them to be locals but again I dont concern myself with others.\n\n\nSo now to the cause of me feeling like a asshole. I was doing cardio on the bike with my headphones in zoned out. A group of 2 elderly ladies and 2 eldery gentlemen are biking and chatting next to me I glance over and see they are passing panflets with \"Jesus will save you\" and such back and forth and one elderly gentleman has a vanilla envelope I assume full of them. Whatever right? Not bugging me and they all seemed happy and knew eachother. They walk away and I continue peddling along. After about 5 mins I feel a tap on my shoulder and it is one of the elderly ladies. With a big smile on her face she tries to hand me a panflit, I  shake my head and say \"no thank you\" and face forward again. She then taps me again and motions for me to take my headphones off. I do and say, a little for annoyed, \"yes?\" She then says \"you should take this hun, you look like you need saving\" . I was pretty shocked but responded with \" I dont need anything thing from you maam\" and put my headphone back in. \n\n\nNow i thought that would be it but not 2 mins later she comes back with 2 of the older gentleman. They tap me on the shoulder again and berate me for being rude and not accepting the lords light into me and how I should be ashamed blah blah blah. I dont get to say anything before they walk away. I do however go right to the front desk and ask to speak to a manager.\n\nI explained to her exactly what happened and how it was pretty shocking and if something could be said to them so it doesn't happen again. She then informs her this isnt the first time it has been reported and let's me know she will handle it. I walk out and go back to my bike. She then comes out, gathers the 3 people who spoke to me, old lady included, and kicks them out. \n\nThey actually start pleading and apologizing and looked genuinely upset. I heard them offer to apologize but the manager had none of it. I now feel awful and didnt mean to have them kicked out or worse AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting a group of elderly people kicked out of the gym for trying to give religious pamphlets. The author explains that they were at the gym later than usual, encountered a group passing out religious materials, and when approached directly, refused and then later complained to the manager, leading to their removal.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The gym is a public space, and while freedom of speech applies, there are also rules about what's allowed. The author was in their own space, using a bike, and the elderly group was passing out pamphlets. The author didn't initiate contact but was approached. The key points are whether the group was being intrusive or violating gym policies.\n\nThe author declined the pamphlet and tried to be polite, but the group persisted, even after being refused. The manager mentioned it wasn't the first time this had happened, which suggests a pattern of behavior that's problematic. The author reported it because they felt harassed or uncomfortable. The manager then took action, leading to the group being kicked out. \n\nNow, the question is about fault. The author didn't confront the group directly but sought help from management. The elderly group, while well-meaning, might have been violating the gym's rules by repeatedly approaching someone who clearly didn't want to engage. The manager's decision to remove them implies there was a policy against such behavior. \n\nHowever, the author's actions could be seen as overreacting if the persistence wasn't hostile. But considering the manager's prior knowledge of similar incidents, the author's complaint was valid. The elderly group did apologize and seemed upset, which might indicate they thought their actions were acceptable. But the manager had to enforce the rules regardless. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't in the wrong for seeking assistance when they felt disrespected or harassed. The manager made the final call based on policies. The author's initial refusal was polite, but the group's continued approach might have crossed a line. So, the answer would lean towards the author not being in the wrong.\n"
