I usually go in around 6 or 7 and I'm out by 9ish. With the new time change and my fiancee getting a new job it has thrown me off a bit so I have been going to the gym later. \n\nMy gym pretty much consists of the elderly (I'm 25 myself) with a few other gym goers my age. Now I go to the gym alone as I like having some quiet time and it's a good stress reliever for me. I also wanna add that I keep to myself. I dont talk to anyone or bother myself with other people because I just get in my own head. The reason I add this is because many of the older gym goers like to chat and hangout even when I would normally go at 7am. I really dont mind this aa they dont take up any gym equipment and are pleasant as far as I can tell. Now obviously since I'm at the gym a few hours later then I normally go a few people I dont normally see are here but I assume them to be locals but again I dont concern myself with others.\n\n\nSo now to the cause of me feeling like a asshole. I was doing cardio on the bike with my headphones in zoned out. A group of 2 elderly ladies and 2 eldery gentlemen are biking and chatting next to me I glance over and see they are passing panflets with \"Jesus will save you\" and such back and forth and one elderly gentleman has a vanilla envelope I assume full of them. Whatever right? Not bugging me and they all seemed happy and knew eachother. They walk away and I continue peddling along. After about 5 mins I feel a tap on my shoulder and it is one of the elderly ladies. With a big smile on her face she tries to hand me a panflit, I  shake my head and say \"no thank you\" and face forward again. She then taps me again and motions for me to take my headphones off. I do and say, a little for annoyed, \"yes?\" She then says \"you should take this hun, you look like you need saving\" . I was pretty shocked but responded with \" I dont need anything thing from you maam\" and put my headphone back in. \n\n\nNow i thought that would be it but not 2 mins later she comes back with 2 of the older gentleman. They tap me on the shoulder again and berate me for being rude and not accepting the lords light into me and how I should be ashamed blah blah blah. I dont get to say anything before they walk away. I do however go right to the front desk and ask to speak to a manager.\n\nI explained to her exactly what happened and how it was pretty shocking and if something could be said to them so it doesn't happen again. She then informs her this isnt the first time it has been reported and let's me know she will handle it. I walk out and go back to my bike. She then comes out, gathers the 3 people who spoke to me, old lady included, and kicks them out. \n\nThey actually start pleading and apologizing and looked genuinely upset. I heard them offer to apologize but the manager had none of it. I now feel awful and didnt mean to have them kicked out or worse AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for getting a group of elderly people kicked out of the gym after they tried to give him religious pamphlets.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author goes to the gym regularly and usually likes the quiet. When he goes later, he notices more people, including this group of elderly folks. They're passing out religious material. When he declines, they become insistent, leading him to report them. The manager then kicks them out, and the author now feels bad.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in many places, proselytizing in public spaces like a gym isn't illegal unless it's disruptive. The elderly group was passing out pamphlets, which is generally protected free speech. However, they did approach the author multiple times after he refused, which could be seen as harassment if it's persistent and unwelcome.\n\nThe key points here are consent and persistence. The author said \"no thank you,\" which should be a sign for others to stop. The fact that the group kept approaching him after he declined might cross the line into harassment. The author's main issue was that they were interrupting his time at the gym, which he paid for, and he felt his space was invaded.\n\nBut the author also approached the manager to report the incident. The manager had handled similar reports before, so there was a precedent. The elderly people were kicked out, and they seemed apologetic. The author's intention was to stop the disruption, which is understandable. However, the outcome might have been harsher than necessary, like a warning instead of expulsion.\n\nOn the other hand, the elderly might have been sharing their beliefs in a way that's respectful to them but intrusive to others. The author's reaction could be seen as a valid self-defense of personal space, especially if he felt targeted or harassed. The manager's decision to remove them might be in line with gym policies to prevent disturbances.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, declining the pamphlets was his right. Reporting their continued insistence after being told no is also a reasonable action if he felt it was harassment. However, could he have handled it differently, like speaking to them first or asking the manager for a warning? Maybe, but the situation escalated quickly. The manager's role is to enforce policies, so if there was a policy against harassment, the author's report was justified.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author might have acted in self-defense regarding his personal space and the gym's policies, the elderly's actions were within their rights until the group became insistent. The author's initial refusal was correct, but the outcome led to the elderly being kicked out, which they found upsetting. It's a nuanced situation where both parties might have valid points, but the author's actions were likely within his rights given the context of harassment and the gym's policies.\n"
