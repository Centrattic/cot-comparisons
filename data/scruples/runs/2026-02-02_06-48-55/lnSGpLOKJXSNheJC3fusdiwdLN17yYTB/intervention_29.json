I usually go in around 6 or 7 and I'm out by 9ish. With the new time change and my fiancee getting a new job it has thrown me off a bit so I have been going to the gym later. \n\nMy gym pretty much consists of the elderly (I'm 25 myself) with a few other gym goers my age. Now I go to the gym alone as I like having some quiet time and it's a good stress reliever for me. I also wanna add that I keep to myself. I dont talk to anyone or bother myself with other people because I just get in my own head. The reason I add this is because many of the older gym goers like to chat and hangout even when I would normally go at 7am. I really dont mind this aa they dont take up any gym equipment and are pleasant as far as I can tell. Now obviously since I'm at the gym a few hours later then I normally go a few people I dont normally see are here but I assume them to be locals but again I dont concern myself with others.\n\n\nSo now to the cause of me feeling like a asshole. I was doing cardio on the bike with my headphones in zoned out. A group of 2 elderly ladies and 2 eldery gentlemen are biking and chatting next to me I glance over and see they are passing panflets with \"Jesus will save you\" and such back and forth and one elderly gentleman has a vanilla envelope I assume full of them. Whatever right? Not bugging me and they all seemed happy and knew eachother. They walk away and I continue peddling along. After about 5 mins I feel a tap on my shoulder and it is one of the elderly ladies. With a big smile on her face she tries to hand me a panflit, I  shake my head and say \"no thank you\" and face forward again. She then taps me again and motions for me to take my headphones off. I do and say, a little for annoyed, \"yes?\" She then says \"you should take this hun, you look like you need saving\" . I was pretty shocked but responded with \" I dont need anything thing from you maam\" and put my headphone back in. \n\n\nNow i thought that would be it but not 2 mins later she comes back with 2 of the older gentleman. They tap me on the shoulder again and berate me for being rude and not accepting the lords light into me and how I should be ashamed blah blah blah. I dont get to say anything before they walk away. I do however go right to the front desk and ask to speak to a manager.\n\nI explained to her exactly what happened and how it was pretty shocking and if something could be said to them so it doesn't happen again. She then informs her this isnt the first time it has been reported and let's me know she will handle it. I walk out and go back to my bike. She then comes out, gathers the 3 people who spoke to me, old lady included, and kicks them out. \n\nThey actually start pleading and apologizing and looked genuinely upset. I heard them offer to apologize but the manager had none of it. I now feel awful and didnt mean to have them kicked out or worse AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person went to the gym, was doing their workout, and a group of elderly people started handing out religious pamphlets. When they refused, the group became more insistent, leading the person to report them to the manager and have them kicked out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the author was at the gym to have some quiet time. They mentioned they value their alone time and that the gym is a stress reliever. The elderly people were present, chatting and passing out religious materials. The author initially didn't mind them, but when they were approached directly, they said no and then faced a confrontation. \n\nThe key points here are consent and harassment. The elderly group approached the author multiple times, continuing to pressure them after a refusal. Even though they might have been well-meaning, persistent solicitation in a public place, especially when the person has rejected the offer, can be considered harassment. The manager was informed, and it wasn't the first time such an issue occurred, so the manager acted appropriately by removing them.\n\nHowever, the author might feel bad because the elderly people seemed genuinely upset and offered to apologize. But the manager's decision was based on previous reports and the need to maintain a respectful environment for all patrons. The author's action was to report the behavior, which the manager then addressed. \n\nThe author didn't directly kick them out; they reported the incident. The manager made the decision, and the author's role was to ensure their own comfort and safety by reporting harassment. So, the manager's action was within their rights, and the author wasn't in the wrong for seeking an intervention. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
