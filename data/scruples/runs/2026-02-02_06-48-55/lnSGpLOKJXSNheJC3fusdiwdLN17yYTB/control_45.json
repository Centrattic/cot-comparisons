I usually go in around 6 or 7 and I'm out by 9ish. With the new time change and my fiancee getting a new job it has thrown me off a bit so I have been going to the gym later. \n\nMy gym pretty much consists of the elderly (I'm 25 myself) with a few other gym goers my age. Now I go to the gym alone as I like having some quiet time and it's a good stress reliever for me. I also wanna add that I keep to myself. I dont talk to anyone or bother myself with other people because I just get in my own head. The reason I add this is because many of the older gym goers like to chat and hangout even when I would normally go at 7am. I really dont mind this aa they dont take up any gym equipment and are pleasant as far as I can tell. Now obviously since I'm at the gym a few hours later then I normally go a few people I dont normally see are here but I assume them to be locals but again I dont concern myself with others.\n\n\nSo now to the cause of me feeling like a asshole. I was doing cardio on the bike with my headphones in zoned out. A group of 2 elderly ladies and 2 eldery gentlemen are biking and chatting next to me I glance over and see they are passing panflets with \"Jesus will save you\" and such back and forth and one elderly gentleman has a vanilla envelope I assume full of them. Whatever right? Not bugging me and they all seemed happy and knew eachother. They walk away and I continue peddling along. After about 5 mins I feel a tap on my shoulder and it is one of the elderly ladies. With a big smile on her face she tries to hand me a panflit, I  shake my head and say \"no thank you\" and face forward again. She then taps me again and motions for me to take my headphones off. I do and say, a little for annoyed, \"yes?\" She then says \"you should take this hun, you look like you need saving\" . I was pretty shocked but responded with \" I dont need anything thing from you maam\" and put my headphone back in. \n\n\nNow i thought that would be it but not 2 mins later she comes back with 2 of the older gentleman. They tap me on the shoulder again and berate me for being rude and not accepting the lords light into me and how I should be ashamed blah blah blah. I dont get to say anything before they walk away. I do however go right to the front desk and ask to speak to a manager.\n\nI explained to her exactly what happened and how it was pretty shocking and if something could be said to them so it doesn't happen again. She then informs her this isnt the first time it has been reported and let's me know she will handle it. I walk out and go back to my bike. She then comes out, gathers the 3 people who spoke to me, old lady included, and kicks them out. \n\nThey actually start pleading and apologizing and looked genuinely upset. I heard them offer to apologize but the manager had none of it. I now feel awful and didnt mean to have them kicked out or worse AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for getting a group of elderly people kicked out of the gym. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context. The author goes to the gym later than usual because of schedule changes. They like quiet time and keep to themselves. The older group is there, passing out religious pamphlets. They approach the author twice, even after being refused. The second time, they come with others and berate the author for being rude. The author then reports this to the manager, who kicks them out. The author feels bad and is asking if they're the asshole.\n\nSo, the key points here are harassment and respecting personal space. The author was zoned out with headphones on, which is a common way people indicate they don't want to be disturbed. The elderly group approached multiple times after a refusal, which could be seen as persistent and intrusive. The manager had prior reports, so this isn't an isolated incident. The manager acted to stop the harassment, which aligns with policies to ensure a welcoming environment for all.\n\nNow, considering the author's actions: reporting the behavior to management is a reasonable step when someone is being harassed. The author didn't confront the group directly but sought to resolve the issue through proper channels. The manager's decision to remove them was based on existing reports, not just this incident. \n\nThe author's intention was to stop the harassment, not to target the elderly group. They felt awful afterward, indicating they didn't want to harm anyone but needed to address the harassment. The key is whether the author overstepped. Since the manager already had reports and the group's actions were ongoing, the author was likely within their rights to report it.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They acted to stop unwanted harassment in a public space, which the gym management supports.\n"
