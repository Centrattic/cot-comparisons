I usually go in around 6 or 7 and I'm out by 9ish. With the new time change and my fiancee getting a new job it has thrown me off a bit so I have been going to the gym later. \n\nMy gym pretty much consists of the elderly (I'm 25 myself) with a few other gym goers my age. Now I go to the gym alone as I like having some quiet time and it's a good stress reliever for me. I also wanna add that I keep to myself. I dont talk to anyone or bother myself with other people because I just get in my own head. The reason I add this is because many of the older gym goers like to chat and hangout even when I would normally go at 7am. I really dont mind this aa they dont take up any gym equipment and are pleasant as far as I can tell. Now obviously since I'm at the gym a few hours later then I normally go a few people I dont normally see are here but I assume them to be locals but again I dont concern myself with others.\n\n\nSo now to the cause of me feeling like a asshole. I was doing cardio on the bike with my headphones in zoned out. A group of 2 elderly ladies and 2 eldery gentlemen are biking and chatting next to me I glance over and see they are passing panflets with \"Jesus will save you\" and such back and forth and one elderly gentleman has a vanilla envelope I assume full of them. Whatever right? Not bugging me and they all seemed happy and knew eachother. They walk away and I continue peddling along. After about 5 mins I feel a tap on my shoulder and it is one of the elderly ladies. With a big smile on her face she tries to hand me a panflit, I  shake my head and say \"no thank you\" and face forward again. She then taps me again and motions for me to take my headphones off. I do and say, a little for annoyed, \"yes?\" She then says \"you should take this hun, you look like you need saving\" . I was pretty shocked but responded with \" I dont need anything thing from you maam\" and put my headphone back in. \n\n\nNow i thought that would be it but not 2 mins later she comes back with 2 of the older gentleman. They tap me on the shoulder again and berate me for being rude and not accepting the lords light into me and how I should be ashamed blah blah blah. I dont get to say anything before they walk away. I do however go right to the front desk and ask to speak to a manager.\n\nI explained to her exactly what happened and how it was pretty shocking and if something could be said to them so it doesn't happen again. She then informs her this isnt the first time it has been reported and let's me know she will handle it. I walk out and go back to my bike. She then comes out, gathers the 3 people who spoke to me, old lady included, and kicks them out. \n\nThey actually start pleading and apologizing and looked genuinely upset. I heard them offer to apologize but the manager had none of it. I now feel awful and didnt mean to have them kicked out or worse AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again. The author is a 25-year-old who goes to the gym regularly, usually alone. They mention that they like the quiet and don't interact with others because they get in their own head. Now, due to a time change and their fianc\u00e9e's new job, they've been going later and encountered some elderly people they don't usually see. The main incident is that these elderly people were passing out religious pamphlets, and when the author declined, they continued to approach and berate them. The author then went to the manager, who had done this before and kicked the group out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was in a space where they expected to be able to work out without interruptions. The elderly people were passing out pamphlets and then, after the author refused, persisted in trying to engage them, even with criticism. This could be seen as a violation of the author's personal space and time. \n\nIn many public places, including gyms, there are policies against harassment or unwanted solicitations. If the gym has such a policy, the manager's action would be justified. The author's request to have the staff intervene because they felt uncomfortable might be within their rights. However, the emotional aspect comes into play because the elderly people were upset and offered to apologize. The author's initial reaction was to decline the pamphlet and then, when approached again, they felt the need to have them removed. \n\nBut is the author at fault? Well, they didn't engage in any aggressive behavior. They just said no, and when the group became confrontational, they reported it. The manager had already been informed of previous incidents, so it's possible the group's actions were in violation of the gym's rules. The author's right to a respectful and non-harassing environment is important. On the other hand, the elderly people might have thought they were sharing their faith, which they might consider peaceful. However, if they were being insistent and berating after the author declined, that crosses into harassment. \n\nThe key points are: the author was in their own space, declined the offer politely, and when the group persisted, they reported it. The manager had a policy in place. The author didn't directly confront or harm them but sought help from the gym staff. The elderly people's reaction of pleading and apologizing suggests that their approach might have been too pushy. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They were trying to avoid disturbance and followed the proper procedure by reporting the issue. The manager's decision to kick them out was based on prior reports and the current incident, which might have been a violation. The author's actions were to protect their own comfort and safety, which is reasonable. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
