I usually go in around 6 or 7 and I'm out by 9ish. With the new time change and my fiancee getting a new job it has thrown me off a bit so I have been going to the gym later. \n\nMy gym pretty much consists of the elderly (I'm 25 myself) with a few other gym goers my age. Now I go to the gym alone as I like having some quiet time and it's a good stress reliever for me. I also wanna add that I keep to myself. I dont talk to anyone or bother myself with other people because I just get in my own head. The reason I add this is because many of the older gym goers like to chat and hangout even when I would normally go at 7am. I really dont mind this aa they dont take up any gym equipment and are pleasant as far as I can tell. Now obviously since I'm at the gym a few hours later then I normally go a few people I dont normally see are here but I assume them to be locals but again I dont concern myself with others.\n\n\nSo now to the cause of me feeling like a asshole. I was doing cardio on the bike with my headphones in zoned out. A group of 2 elderly ladies and 2 eldery gentlemen are biking and chatting next to me I glance over and see they are passing panflets with \"Jesus will save you\" and such back and forth and one elderly gentleman has a vanilla envelope I assume full of them. Whatever right? Not bugging me and they all seemed happy and knew eachother. They walk away and I continue peddling along. After about 5 mins I feel a tap on my shoulder and it is one of the elderly ladies. With a big smile on her face she tries to hand me a panflit, I  shake my head and say \"no thank you\" and face forward again. She then taps me again and motions for me to take my headphones off. I do and say, a little for annoyed, \"yes?\" She then says \"you should take this hun, you look like you need saving\" . I was pretty shocked but responded with \" I dont need anything thing from you maam\" and put my headphone back in. \n\n\nNow i thought that would be it but not 2 mins later she comes back with 2 of the older gentleman. They tap me on the shoulder again and berate me for being rude and not accepting the lords light into me and how I should be ashamed blah blah blah. I dont get to say anything before they walk away. I do however go right to the front desk and ask to speak to a manager.\n\nI explained to her exactly what happened and how it was pretty shocking and if something could be said to them so it doesn't happen again. She then informs her this isnt the first time it has been reported and let's me know she will handle it. I walk out and go back to my bike. She then comes out, gathers the 3 people who spoke to me, old lady included, and kicks them out. \n\nThey actually start pleading and apologizing and looked genuinely upset. I heard them offer to apologize but the manager had none of it. I now feel awful and didnt mean to have them kicked out or worse AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for getting a group of elderly people kicked out of the gym after they tried to give him religious pamphlets. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author goes to the gym regularly but changed his time due to a new job. He likes to be alone, using the gym as a quiet space. He encountered a group of elderly people who are passing out religious pamphlets. One lady tried to give him one, he declined, and then she and others came back to berate him. He then reported it to the manager, who kicked them out.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the elderly people were giving out religious literature, which the author didn't want. He politely declined once, but then they continued to hassle him. The manager had previously received complaints about this group. The author felt he was in the right for asking the manager to address the issue, but now feels guilty because the elderly people were upset and apologetic.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. In many places, religious solicitation in public spaces can be a tricky issue. If the gym is a private business, they have the right to set their own policies regarding such activities. If the elderly people were doing this consistently and it was reported before, then the manager had a reason to act. \n\nThe author initially didn't confront them directly but waited until after the harassment to report it. The key here is whether the elderly people were violating the gym's rules. If the gym doesn't allow solicitation, then the manager was justified in removing them. However, if the author's action led to the elderly people losing access to the gym, maybe there's a question about proportionality. Did the author overreact, or was he within his rights to report the harassment?\n\nAlso, the elderly people were apologetic and pleaded to stay, which might indicate they didn't realize they were being disruptive. The author might feel he was in the right to stop the harassment but now feels bad because he caused them to be kicked out. The manager had already been informed of previous issues, so maybe the author wasn't the one who started the process, just escalated it.\n\nIn terms of the author's actions: he declined the pamphlets, then the group continued to confront him. He reported it to the manager, who had the authority to handle it. If the manager had existing policies against this behavior, then the author was correct in reporting it. He wasn't directly responsible for their removal; the manager made that decision. However, the author initiated the action by reporting, so some might see it as his fault. Others might see it as his right to report harassment.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the elderly people were just sharing their beliefs and weren't aware it was against the gym's rules. The author could have approached them more directly first, but he chose to go to the manager. That's a valid approach, but if the gym's policy isn't clear, it might be a gray area.\n\nSo, weighing both sides: the author didn't physically kick them out; the manager did. The manager had prior knowledge of the issue. The author acted within his rights to report harassment. However, the elderly people were upset and apologetic, suggesting they didn't intend harm. The manager's action was final, so the author's role was just to report. Whether he's in the wrong depends on whether the manager's action was justified. If the manager had the right to remove them based on policy, then the author isn't in the wrong for reporting. But if the manager overstepped, then maybe the author is partially responsible.\n\nIn many such cases, businesses do have the right to limit solicitation unless the patrons consent. So, the author's action was within his rights. Therefore, he's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
