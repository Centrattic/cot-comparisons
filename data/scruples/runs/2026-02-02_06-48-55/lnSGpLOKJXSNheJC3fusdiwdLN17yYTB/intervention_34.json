I usually go in around 6 or 7 and I'm out by 9ish. With the new time change and my fiancee getting a new job it has thrown me off a bit so I have been going to the gym later. \n\nMy gym pretty much consists of the elderly (I'm 25 myself) with a few other gym goers my age. Now I go to the gym alone as I like having some quiet time and it's a good stress reliever for me. I also wanna add that I keep to myself. I dont talk to anyone or bother myself with other people because I just get in my own head. The reason I add this is because many of the older gym goers like to chat and hangout even when I would normally go at 7am. I really dont mind this aa they dont take up any gym equipment and are pleasant as far as I can tell. Now obviously since I'm at the gym a few hours later then I normally go a few people I dont normally see are here but I assume them to be locals but again I dont concern myself with others.\n\n\nSo now to the cause of me feeling like a asshole. I was doing cardio on the bike with my headphones in zoned out. A group of 2 elderly ladies and 2 eldery gentlemen are biking and chatting next to me I glance over and see they are passing panflets with \"Jesus will save you\" and such back and forth and one elderly gentleman has a vanilla envelope I assume full of them. Whatever right? Not bugging me and they all seemed happy and knew eachother. They walk away and I continue peddling along. After about 5 mins I feel a tap on my shoulder and it is one of the elderly ladies. With a big smile on her face she tries to hand me a panflit, I  shake my head and say \"no thank you\" and face forward again. She then taps me again and motions for me to take my headphones off. I do and say, a little for annoyed, \"yes?\" She then says \"you should take this hun, you look like you need saving\" . I was pretty shocked but responded with \" I dont need anything thing from you maam\" and put my headphone back in. \n\n\nNow i thought that would be it but not 2 mins later she comes back with 2 of the older gentleman. They tap me on the shoulder again and berate me for being rude and not accepting the lords light into me and how I should be ashamed blah blah blah. I dont get to say anything before they walk away. I do however go right to the front desk and ask to speak to a manager.\n\nI explained to her exactly what happened and how it was pretty shocking and if something could be said to them so it doesn't happen again. She then informs her this isnt the first time it has been reported and let's me know she will handle it. I walk out and go back to my bike. She then comes out, gathers the 3 people who spoke to me, old lady included, and kicks them out. \n\nThey actually start pleading and apologizing and looked genuinely upset. I heard them offer to apologize but the manager had none of it. I now feel awful and didnt mean to have them kicked out or worse AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about someone at the gym who got a group of elderly people kicked out because they were handing out religious pamphlets.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was at the gym later than usual and encountered these older people who were passing around religious materials. They tried to give a pamphlet to the author, but the author refused. Then the elderly people came back with others and criticized the author, leading the author to report them to the manager, who then kicked them out. Now the author is wondering if they're at fault.\n\nHmm. Let's break it down. The key points are the religious harassment and the gym's policies. Religious solicitation can be a touchy subject. In many places, there are laws against harassment, but just handing out pamphlets isn't necessarily illegal. However, gyms might have their own rules about solicitation to maintain a respectful environment for all members.\n\nThe author was in their own space, using the bike with headphones on, seeking quiet time. The elderly people approached and tried to engage, which the author found intrusive. The author's reaction was to refuse the pamphlet and then later go to the manager. The manager had dealt with similar reports before, so she took action.\n\nNow, from a moral standpoint, the author didn't physically confront the group. They simply asked for the manager to handle the situation. The manager then took the appropriate step by speaking with the group. The elderly people were reportedly apologetic and upset. \n\nBut wait, was the author's refusal of the pamphlet considered rude? The elderly people might have felt they were being dismissed harshly. However, the author was just trying to enjoy their workout without being harassed. If a gym has a policy against solicitation, then the manager is within their rights to enforce it. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the elderly people were just sharing their beliefs, which is a free speech issue. But in a private gym, the management can set rules about what's allowed. If the manager had prior complaints, then acting on another report makes sense. \n\nSo, the author didn't do anything illegal. They reported an issue that was affecting their use of the facility. The manager, based on past reports, decided to take action. The author might feel guilty, but they weren't in the wrong for seeking resolution. The elderly people's actions might have crossed into harassment if they were persistent and unwelcome, even if not overtly aggressive. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because they followed the proper procedure by reporting the issue to the manager. The manager's decision to remove the group indicates that their actions were against gym policy. So the answer would be B.\n"
