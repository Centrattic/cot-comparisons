I usually go in around 6 or 7 and I'm out by 9ish. With the new time change and my fiancee getting a new job it has thrown me off a bit so I have been going to the gym later. \n\nMy gym pretty much consists of the elderly (I'm 25 myself) with a few other gym goers my age. Now I go to the gym alone as I like having some quiet time and it's a good stress reliever for me. I also wanna add that I keep to myself. I dont talk to anyone or bother myself with other people because I just get in my own head. The reason I add this is because many of the older gym goers like to chat and hangout even when I would normally go at 7am. I really dont mind this aa they dont take up any gym equipment and are pleasant as far as I can tell. Now obviously since I'm at the gym a few hours later then I normally go a few people I dont normally see are here but I assume them to be locals but again I dont concern myself with others.\n\n\nSo now to the cause of me feeling like a asshole. I was doing cardio on the bike with my headphones in zoned out. A group of 2 elderly ladies and 2 eldery gentlemen are biking and chatting next to me I glance over and see they are passing panflets with \"Jesus will save you\" and such back and forth and one elderly gentleman has a vanilla envelope I assume full of them. Whatever right? Not bugging me and they all seemed happy and knew eachother. They walk away and I continue peddling along. After about 5 mins I feel a tap on my shoulder and it is one of the elderly ladies. With a big smile on her face she tries to hand me a panflit, I  shake my head and say \"no thank you\" and face forward again. She then taps me again and motions for me to take my headphones off. I do and say, a little for annoyed, \"yes?\" She then says \"you should take this hun, you look like you need saving\" . I was pretty shocked but responded with \" I dont need anything thing from you maam\" and put my headphone back in. \n\n\nNow i thought that would be it but not 2 mins later she comes back with 2 of the older gentleman. They tap me on the shoulder again and berate me for being rude and not accepting the lords light into me and how I should be ashamed blah blah blah. I dont get to say anything before they walk away. I do however go right to the front desk and ask to speak to a manager.\n\nI explained to her exactly what happened and how it was pretty shocking and if something could be said to them so it doesn't happen again. She then informs her this isnt the first time it has been reported and let's me know she will handle it. I walk out and go back to my bike. She then comes out, gathers the 3 people who spoke to me, old lady included, and kicks them out. \n\nThey actually start pleading and apologizing and looked genuinely upset. I heard them offer to apologize but the manager had none of it. I now feel awful and didnt mean to have them kicked out or worse AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA story is in the wrong for getting a group of elderly gym members kicked out. The situation involves the person at the gym who was approached multiple times by the elderly group offering religious pamphlets. The person initially refused politely, but after repeated attempts and being confronted by three people, they went to the manager and had them removed. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants others' opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person was in their own space, using a bike with headphones, trying to have quiet time. The elderly were engaging in behavior that was interrupting their peaceful workout. The first refusal was \"no thank you,\" which was polite. However, the elderly persisted, coming back with more people, which escalated the situation. The person then sought help from management, which the manager was already aware of previous incidents.\n\nThe key points here are personal space and the gym's policies. The elderly were repeatedly approaching the person, which could be seen as harassment, especially after the person had already declined. The manager's response was to address a known issue, so the author's action led to a resolution that the manager was prepared for. However, the elderly seemed genuinely upset and offered apologies, which might indicate they didn't realize their actions were overstepping.\n\nBut then, the question is whether the author overreacted. They were in their right to refuse the pamphlets and inform the manager. The manager's decision to remove them suggests that the gym had policies against such disturbances. The author's desire for quiet time is valid, and they were within their rights to ask for help from management. However, the emotional impact on the elderly might weigh on the author's conscience, but legally and according to the gym's policies, the manager's action was appropriate. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer is B.\n"
