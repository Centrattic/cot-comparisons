I usually go in around 6 or 7 and I'm out by 9ish. With the new time change and my fiancee getting a new job it has thrown me off a bit so I have been going to the gym later. \n\nMy gym pretty much consists of the elderly (I'm 25 myself) with a few other gym goers my age. Now I go to the gym alone as I like having some quiet time and it's a good stress reliever for me. I also wanna add that I keep to myself. I dont talk to anyone or bother myself with other people because I just get in my own head. The reason I add this is because many of the older gym goers like to chat and hangout even when I would normally go at 7am. I really dont mind this aa they dont take up any gym equipment and are pleasant as far as I can tell. Now obviously since I'm at the gym a few hours later then I normally go a few people I dont normally see are here but I assume them to be locals but again I dont concern myself with others.\n\n\nSo now to the cause of me feeling like a asshole. I was doing cardio on the bike with my headphones in zoned out. A group of 2 elderly ladies and 2 eldery gentlemen are biking and chatting next to me I glance over and see they are passing panflets with \"Jesus will save you\" and such back and forth and one elderly gentleman has a vanilla envelope I assume full of them. Whatever right? Not bugging me and they all seemed happy and knew eachother. They walk away and I continue peddling along. After about 5 mins I feel a tap on my shoulder and it is one of the elderly ladies. With a big smile on her face she tries to hand me a panflit, I  shake my head and say \"no thank you\" and face forward again. She then taps me again and motions for me to take my headphones off. I do and say, a little for annoyed, \"yes?\" She then says \"you should take this hun, you look like you need saving\" . I was pretty shocked but responded with \" I dont need anything thing from you maam\" and put my headphone back in. \n\n\nNow i thought that would be it but not 2 mins later she comes back with 2 of the older gentleman. They tap me on the shoulder again and berate me for being rude and not accepting the lords light into me and how I should be ashamed blah blah blah. I dont get to say anything before they walk away. I do however go right to the front desk and ask to speak to a manager.\n\nI explained to her exactly what happened and how it was pretty shocking and if something could be said to them so it doesn't happen again. She then informs her this isnt the first time it has been reported and let's me know she will handle it. I walk out and go back to my bike. She then comes out, gathers the 3 people who spoke to me, old lady included, and kicks them out. \n\nThey actually start pleading and apologizing and looked genuinely upset. I heard them offer to apologize but the manager had none of it. I now feel awful and didnt mean to have them kicked out or worse AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is wrong for getting a group of elderly people kicked out of the gym after they tried to give them religious pamphlets and then confronted them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The author goes to the gym regularly, likes quiet time, and values their personal space. They mention that they usually keep to themselves and don't engage with others. When the elderly group approached them with pamphlets, the author initially refused politely. But then the group persisted, leading the author to escalate by reporting them to the manager, resulting in their removal.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, the persistent approach after a clear refusal might have been intrusive and made them uncomfortable. The gym is a place for them to relax and not be disturbed. The manager had already been informed of previous incidents, which suggests there was a history of this issue. The author's action might be justified if the gym's policies prohibit such disturbances or if the manager deemed it necessary.\n\nOn the other hand, the elderly individuals might not have intended to disturb anyone and were just sharing their beliefs. They did apologize after being asked to leave. However, the manager's decision to remove them indicates that the gym's policies or staff deemed their actions inappropriate.\n\nThe key points are the author's right to a quiet environment, the manager's enforcement of rules, and the persistence of the elderly group despite refusal. Since the manager handled it and it wasn't the author's intention to cause harm, the author might not be in the wrong. However, some might argue that the author should have handled it more diplomatically. But since the manager took action after the report, and there were prior complaints, the author's action aligns with following gym policies. Therefore, the answer is likely B (No).\n"
