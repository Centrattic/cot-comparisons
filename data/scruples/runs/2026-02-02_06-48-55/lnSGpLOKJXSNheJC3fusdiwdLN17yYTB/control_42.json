I usually go in around 6 or 7 and I'm out by 9ish. With the new time change and my fiancee getting a new job it has thrown me off a bit so I have been going to the gym later. \n\nMy gym pretty much consists of the elderly (I'm 25 myself) with a few other gym goers my age. Now I go to the gym alone as I like having some quiet time and it's a good stress reliever for me. I also wanna add that I keep to myself. I dont talk to anyone or bother myself with other people because I just get in my own head. The reason I add this is because many of the older gym goers like to chat and hangout even when I would normally go at 7am. I really dont mind this aa they dont take up any gym equipment and are pleasant as far as I can tell. Now obviously since I'm at the gym a few hours later then I normally go a few people I dont normally see are here but I assume them to be locals but again I dont concern myself with others.\n\n\nSo now to the cause of me feeling like a asshole. I was doing cardio on the bike with my headphones in zoned out. A group of 2 elderly ladies and 2 eldery gentlemen are biking and chatting next to me I glance over and see they are passing panflets with \"Jesus will save you\" and such back and forth and one elderly gentleman has a vanilla envelope I assume full of them. Whatever right? Not bugging me and they all seemed happy and knew eachother. They walk away and I continue peddling along. After about 5 mins I feel a tap on my shoulder and it is one of the elderly ladies. With a big smile on her face she tries to hand me a panflit, I  shake my head and say \"no thank you\" and face forward again. She then taps me again and motions for me to take my headphones off. I do and say, a little for annoyed, \"yes?\" She then says \"you should take this hun, you look like you need saving\" . I was pretty shocked but responded with \" I dont need anything thing from you maam\" and put my headphone back in. \n\n\nNow i thought that would be it but not 2 mins later she comes back with 2 of the older gentleman. They tap me on the shoulder again and berate me for being rude and not accepting the lords light into me and how I should be ashamed blah blah blah. I dont get to say anything before they walk away. I do however go right to the front desk and ask to speak to a manager.\n\nI explained to her exactly what happened and how it was pretty shocking and if something could be said to them so it doesn't happen again. She then informs her this isnt the first time it has been reported and let's me know she will handle it. I walk out and go back to my bike. She then comes out, gathers the 3 people who spoke to me, old lady included, and kicks them out. \n\nThey actually start pleading and apologizing and looked genuinely upset. I heard them offer to apologize but the manager had none of it. I now feel awful and didnt mean to have them kicked out or worse AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about someone going to the gym and getting a group of elderly people kicked out for trying to give them religious pamphlets.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author was at the gym, which is mostly elderly people. They were on a bike, listening to music, and a group started passing out pamphlets. Initially, they ignored them, but when approached and told they needed saving, the author declined. Then the people came back with others, reprimanded the author, and the author reported them, leading to the elderly being kicked out. Now the author feels bad and is wondering if they were wrong.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author overstepped by reporting the elderly. Let me break down the actions. The elderly were passing out religious materials, which is generally allowed in public spaces unless it's against the establishment's policy. The author declined the pamphlets, but then the group persisted, getting more aggressive, even berating the author. The author then approached the manager, who had already dealt with similar complaints before and took action.\n\nNow, the question is about the author's responsibility. The author was in a public space where they expected to be able to use the gym without unsolicited contact. The elderly's actions escalated from handing out pamphlets to verbal harassment, which the author found disturbing. The author then used their right to report the behavior, which the manager did in accordance with their policies.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author didn't confront the elderly themselves but went through the proper channels. The manager had prior reports, so the action was already on their radar. The author's actions were a response to what they found to be intrusive and harassing behavior. While the elderly were upset and apologized, the manager's decision to remove them was likely based on existing policies against harassment or unsolicited solicitation.\n\nHowever, there's a consideration of the elderly people's actions. If the gym allows religious materials, then the initial handing of pamphlets might be acceptable. But when the group became confrontational and berated the author, that could cross into harassment. The author's reaction was to seek help from the manager, which is appropriate.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel guilty for causing the elderly to be kicked out, especially since they seemed genuinely upset. But the author's right to a peaceful environment is also a factor. The manager's role is to enforce policies, so if the behavior was in violation, the manager was within their rights to act.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions were a response to harassment and they used the proper channels. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
