I usually go in around 6 or 7 and I'm out by 9ish. With the new time change and my fiancee getting a new job it has thrown me off a bit so I have been going to the gym later. \n\nMy gym pretty much consists of the elderly (I'm 25 myself) with a few other gym goers my age. Now I go to the gym alone as I like having some quiet time and it's a good stress reliever for me. I also wanna add that I keep to myself. I dont talk to anyone or bother myself with other people because I just get in my own head. The reason I add this is because many of the older gym goers like to chat and hangout even when I would normally go at 7am. I really dont mind this aa they dont take up any gym equipment and are pleasant as far as I can tell. Now obviously since I'm at the gym a few hours later then I normally go a few people I dont normally see are here but I assume them to be locals but again I dont concern myself with others.\n\n\nSo now to the cause of me feeling like a asshole. I was doing cardio on the bike with my headphones in zoned out. A group of 2 elderly ladies and 2 eldery gentlemen are biking and chatting next to me I glance over and see they are passing panflets with \"Jesus will save you\" and such back and forth and one elderly gentleman has a vanilla envelope I assume full of them. Whatever right? Not bugging me and they all seemed happy and knew eachother. They walk away and I continue peddling along. After about 5 mins I feel a tap on my shoulder and it is one of the elderly ladies. With a big smile on her face she tries to hand me a panflit, I  shake my head and say \"no thank you\" and face forward again. She then taps me again and motions for me to take my headphones off. I do and say, a little for annoyed, \"yes?\" She then says \"you should take this hun, you look like you need saving\" . I was pretty shocked but responded with \" I dont need anything thing from you maam\" and put my headphone back in. \n\n\nNow i thought that would be it but not 2 mins later she comes back with 2 of the older gentleman. They tap me on the shoulder again and berate me for being rude and not accepting the lords light into me and how I should be ashamed blah blah blah. I dont get to say anything before they walk away. I do however go right to the front desk and ask to speak to a manager.\n\nI explained to her exactly what happened and how it was pretty shocking and if something could be said to them so it doesn't happen again. She then informs her this isnt the first time it has been reported and let's me know she will handle it. I walk out and go back to my bike. She then comes out, gathers the 3 people who spoke to me, old lady included, and kicks them out. \n\nThey actually start pleading and apologizing and looked genuinely upset. I heard them offer to apologize but the manager had none of it. I now feel awful and didnt mean to have them kicked out or worse AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author being at the gym and encountering a group of elderly people passing out religious pamphlets. The group kept trying to give the author a pamphlet even after he declined, which led the author to report them to the manager, resulting in them being kicked out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author was in a gym, a public place where people might have different expectations about behavior. The elderly group was passing out religious materials, which might be allowed or not depending on the gym's policies. The author declined the pamphlet but then the group continued to approach him, leading to a confrontation. The manager had received previous complaints, so this might be a repeated issue.\n\nThe author's actions: They asked for a manager after feeling harassed. The manager took action based on prior reports. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nPossible angles: Religious freedom vs. harassment. The group might believe they have the right to share their beliefs, but the author felt uncomfortable and harassed. Gyms often have policies against solicitation or harassment. The fact that the manager had prior complaints suggests the behavior was not an isolated incident, which could mean the author wasn't the only one affected. \n\nThe author's response was to report the issue, which is a legitimate way to handle harassment. The elderly group was apologetic, which might indicate they didn't realize the impact of their actions. However, the author's initial refusal was polite, and the group persisted. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Maybe not. They followed the correct procedure by reporting it. The manager's existing reports indicate the problem wasn't just in this instance. The author wasn't aggressive; they declined and then sought help. The elderly group's actions crossed into harassment if they kept approaching after being told no. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might have handled it differently, like ignoring them further or moving to another area. But given the persistence and the previous reports, the author's action to report seems reasonable. The manager's decision to kick them out was in line with policies. So the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
