I usually go in around 6 or 7 and I'm out by 9ish. With the new time change and my fiancee getting a new job it has thrown me off a bit so I have been going to the gym later. \n\nMy gym pretty much consists of the elderly (I'm 25 myself) with a few other gym goers my age. Now I go to the gym alone as I like having some quiet time and it's a good stress reliever for me. I also wanna add that I keep to myself. I dont talk to anyone or bother myself with other people because I just get in my own head. The reason I add this is because many of the older gym goers like to chat and hangout even when I would normally go at 7am. I really dont mind this aa they dont take up any gym equipment and are pleasant as far as I can tell. Now obviously since I'm at the gym a few hours later then I normally go a few people I dont normally see are here but I assume them to be locals but again I dont concern myself with others.\n\n\nSo now to the cause of me feeling like a asshole. I was doing cardio on the bike with my headphones in zoned out. A group of 2 elderly ladies and 2 eldery gentlemen are biking and chatting next to me I glance over and see they are passing panflets with \"Jesus will save you\" and such back and forth and one elderly gentleman has a vanilla envelope I assume full of them. Whatever right? Not bugging me and they all seemed happy and knew eachother. They walk away and I continue peddling along. After about 5 mins I feel a tap on my shoulder and it is one of the elderly ladies. With a big smile on her face she tries to hand me a panflit, I  shake my head and say \"no thank you\" and face forward again. She then taps me again and motions for me to take my headphones off. I do and say, a little for annoyed, \"yes?\" She then says \"you should take this hun, you look like you need saving\" . I was pretty shocked but responded with \" I dont need anything thing from you maam\" and put my headphone back in. \n\n\nNow i thought that would be it but not 2 mins later she comes back with 2 of the older gentleman. They tap me on the shoulder again and berate me for being rude and not accepting the lords light into me and how I should be ashamed blah blah blah. I dont get to say anything before they walk away. I do however go right to the front desk and ask to speak to a manager.\n\nI explained to her exactly what happened and how it was pretty shocking and if something could be said to them so it doesn't happen again. She then informs her this isnt the first time it has been reported and let's me know she will handle it. I walk out and go back to my bike. She then comes out, gathers the 3 people who spoke to me, old lady included, and kicks them out. \n\nThey actually start pleading and apologizing and looked genuinely upset. I heard them offer to apologize but the manager had none of it. I now feel awful and didnt mean to have them kicked out or worse AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The scenario is about getting a group of elderly people kicked out of the gym after they tried to give religious pamphlets.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author is 25, goes to the gym where there are a lot of older people. They prefer quiet time and keep to themselves. One day, a group of elderly people gives out pamphlets, and the author declines. Then the group becomes insistent and confrontational. The author reports them to the manager, who then kicks them out. The author now feels bad and wonders if they're at fault.\n\nSo, the key points here. The elderly people were distributing religious materials. The author didn't want to accept them and tried to decline politely. However, the group persisted and the woman kept approaching, even bringing others. The author went to the manager because they felt harassed. The manager already had prior reports and decided to remove them. The author now feels guilty about the outcome.\n\nI need to consider the context. Religious proselytizing in public places like a gym can be a sensitive issue. Many places have policies against solicitation or harassment. The author approached the manager, which is a legitimate action if they felt uncomfortable. But the elderly people seem to be genuinely upset and apologized. The manager might have had just cause based on previous reports.\n\nIs the author wrong? The author was within their rights to report the behavior if they felt it was harassment. However, the persistence of the elderly people might have crossed a line. The author's initial refusal was polite, but the continued pressure could be seen as harassing. The manager's decision to remove them suggests that the gym had a policy in place against such behavior.\n\nBut the author might not have considered the elderly people's intentions. They might have been trying to share their faith in a friendly way, even if it was unwelcome. The author's actions led to people being kicked out, which could be seen as harsh, but if the manager already had prior reports, it might be necessary. So the question is: was the author justified in reporting them, or did they overreact?\n\nThe author did follow the proper procedure by going to the manager. They didn't confront the group themselves beyond declining the pamphlets. The manager's action was based on existing reports, so the author might not be solely to blame. However, the elderly people were distressed and apologized, which might make the author feel like they caused unnecessary harm.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's actions were within their rights to address harassment. The elderly people's behavior might have been inappropriate per gym policy. However, the author might have felt that their privacy was invaded, and the manager handled it correctly. So the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong (B), but there's a nuance here. The elderly people were likely just sharing their beliefs, but the manager's prior reports indicate that their actions were problematic. The author's report was a legitimate step, so they are not at fault. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
