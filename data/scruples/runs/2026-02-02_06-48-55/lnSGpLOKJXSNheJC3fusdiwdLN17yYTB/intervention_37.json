I usually go in around 6 or 7 and I'm out by 9ish. With the new time change and my fiancee getting a new job it has thrown me off a bit so I have been going to the gym later. \n\nMy gym pretty much consists of the elderly (I'm 25 myself) with a few other gym goers my age. Now I go to the gym alone as I like having some quiet time and it's a good stress reliever for me. I also wanna add that I keep to myself. I dont talk to anyone or bother myself with other people because I just get in my own head. The reason I add this is because many of the older gym goers like to chat and hangout even when I would normally go at 7am. I really dont mind this aa they dont take up any gym equipment and are pleasant as far as I can tell. Now obviously since I'm at the gym a few hours later then I normally go a few people I dont normally see are here but I assume them to be locals but again I dont concern myself with others.\n\n\nSo now to the cause of me feeling like a asshole. I was doing cardio on the bike with my headphones in zoned out. A group of 2 elderly ladies and 2 eldery gentlemen are biking and chatting next to me I glance over and see they are passing panflets with \"Jesus will save you\" and such back and forth and one elderly gentleman has a vanilla envelope I assume full of them. Whatever right? Not bugging me and they all seemed happy and knew eachother. They walk away and I continue peddling along. After about 5 mins I feel a tap on my shoulder and it is one of the elderly ladies. With a big smile on her face she tries to hand me a panflit, I  shake my head and say \"no thank you\" and face forward again. She then taps me again and motions for me to take my headphones off. I do and say, a little for annoyed, \"yes?\" She then says \"you should take this hun, you look like you need saving\" . I was pretty shocked but responded with \" I dont need anything thing from you maam\" and put my headphone back in. \n\n\nNow i thought that would be it but not 2 mins later she comes back with 2 of the older gentleman. They tap me on the shoulder again and berate me for being rude and not accepting the lords light into me and how I should be ashamed blah blah blah. I dont get to say anything before they walk away. I do however go right to the front desk and ask to speak to a manager.\n\nI explained to her exactly what happened and how it was pretty shocking and if something could be said to them so it doesn't happen again. She then informs her this isnt the first time it has been reported and let's me know she will handle it. I walk out and go back to my bike. She then comes out, gathers the 3 people who spoke to me, old lady included, and kicks them out. \n\nThey actually start pleading and apologizing and looked genuinely upset. I heard them offer to apologize but the manager had none of it. I now feel awful and didnt mean to have them kicked out or worse AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about getting a group of elderly people kicked out of the gym for handing out religious pamphlets. The author was at the gym later than usual, and when they declined the pamphlet, the elderly people kept trying to engage them, leading the author to report them to the manager.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the gym's policies. Most public places, including gyms, usually have rules about solicitation or harassment. If the gym's policy prohibits distributing literature, especially religious material, then the manager's action might be justified. The manager mentioned that it wasn't the first time this was reported, so the group might have been aware of the rules but continued anyway.\n\nNext, the author's actions. They were in their own space, using the bike with headphones on. The elderly group approached them multiple times after being declined, which could be seen as persistent. The author's response was to report them, which the manager took action on. The key here is whether the author had a right to approach the manager in the first place. If the group's actions were against gym policies, the author was within their rights to report it. However, if the gym didn't have such policies, maybe the author overstepped.\n\nEmotionally, the elderly group seemed genuinely upset and offered an apology, but the manager didn't accept it. The author felt bad afterward, thinking they caused the kickout. The question is whether they were in the wrong. \n\nThe author's main argument is that they were just trying to avoid harassment and maintain their space. The elderly group might not have intended to harass, but their persistence after being declined could be seen as crossing a line. However, the elderly might be exercising their right to share their beliefs, which is protected unless the gym has a specific rule against it.\n\nIn terms of social norms, being respectful when someone declines something is important. If the author felt targeted, reporting it makes sense. But maybe the author could have handled it differently, like ignoring them or politely but firmly removing themselves from the situation. However, given the repeated attempts and the manager's prior knowledge, the author's action might be justified as a last resort.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer depends on the gym's policies and whether the author's actions were in line with those policies. If the policies were clear against such solicitations, the author is not in the wrong. If not, maybe they could be seen as inconsiderate. But since the manager supported the action, it's likely that the policies were in place, so the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
