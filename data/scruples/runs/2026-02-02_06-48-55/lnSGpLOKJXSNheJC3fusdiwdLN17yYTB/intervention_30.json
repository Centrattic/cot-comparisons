I usually go in around 6 or 7 and I'm out by 9ish. With the new time change and my fiancee getting a new job it has thrown me off a bit so I have been going to the gym later. \n\nMy gym pretty much consists of the elderly (I'm 25 myself) with a few other gym goers my age. Now I go to the gym alone as I like having some quiet time and it's a good stress reliever for me. I also wanna add that I keep to myself. I dont talk to anyone or bother myself with other people because I just get in my own head. The reason I add this is because many of the older gym goers like to chat and hangout even when I would normally go at 7am. I really dont mind this aa they dont take up any gym equipment and are pleasant as far as I can tell. Now obviously since I'm at the gym a few hours later then I normally go a few people I dont normally see are here but I assume them to be locals but again I dont concern myself with others.\n\n\nSo now to the cause of me feeling like a asshole. I was doing cardio on the bike with my headphones in zoned out. A group of 2 elderly ladies and 2 eldery gentlemen are biking and chatting next to me I glance over and see they are passing panflets with \"Jesus will save you\" and such back and forth and one elderly gentleman has a vanilla envelope I assume full of them. Whatever right? Not bugging me and they all seemed happy and knew eachother. They walk away and I continue peddling along. After about 5 mins I feel a tap on my shoulder and it is one of the elderly ladies. With a big smile on her face she tries to hand me a panflit, I  shake my head and say \"no thank you\" and face forward again. She then taps me again and motions for me to take my headphones off. I do and say, a little for annoyed, \"yes?\" She then says \"you should take this hun, you look like you need saving\" . I was pretty shocked but responded with \" I dont need anything thing from you maam\" and put my headphone back in. \n\n\nNow i thought that would be it but not 2 mins later she comes back with 2 of the older gentleman. They tap me on the shoulder again and berate me for being rude and not accepting the lords light into me and how I should be ashamed blah blah blah. I dont get to say anything before they walk away. I do however go right to the front desk and ask to speak to a manager.\n\nI explained to her exactly what happened and how it was pretty shocking and if something could be said to them so it doesn't happen again. She then informs her this isnt the first time it has been reported and let's me know she will handle it. I walk out and go back to my bike. She then comes out, gathers the 3 people who spoke to me, old lady included, and kicks them out. \n\nThey actually start pleading and apologizing and looked genuinely upset. I heard them offer to apologize but the manager had none of it. I now feel awful and didnt mean to have them kicked out or worse AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for getting a group of elderly people kicked out of the gym after they approached him with religious pamphlets.\n\nFirst, the man was at the gym, which he usually finds quiet. Because of his schedule, he's there later and encounters these older people who are passing out religious materials. He declines one offer, then they come back with others, reprimand him for being rude, and he reports them to the manager, who then kicks them out.\n\nThe key points here are about rights and harassment. In the US, the First Amendment protects the right to free speech and religious expression. So the elderly people have the right to distribute literature unless the gym specifically prohibits it. The author didn't mention any such rules against this. The issue is whether their actions constituted harassment. Approaching someone and persistently offering pamphlets could be seen as disruptive if it's repeated or intrusive. However, in a public space like a gym, there's a balance between free speech and personal comfort.\n\nThe author initially didn't mind the group, but when they became more aggressive after he refused the first time, he felt harassed. The manager had prior reports, which implies there might be a pattern of behavior that's disruptive. The manager's decision to remove them might be based on past incidents, not just this one. \n\nThe author's intent was to stop the harassment, but he might not have considered if the manager's rules cover such situations. If the gym allows religious materials, then the author's action could be seen as overstepping, even if he felt uncomfortable. However, if the distribution was indeed disruptive or against gym policies (which the manager indicated), then his action was justified. The elderly people apologized, which might suggest they didn't realize they were violating rules, not that the author was wrong to act.\n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the gym's policies and the context of past complaints support the manager's decision. Since the manager already had prior reports and took action, the author likely wasn't in the wrong for following up on legitimate concerns about harassment. The key is that the manager's decision was based on existing issues, making the author's action appropriate in that context.\n"
