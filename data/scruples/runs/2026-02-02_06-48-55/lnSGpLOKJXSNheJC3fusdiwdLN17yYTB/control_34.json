I usually go in around 6 or 7 and I'm out by 9ish. With the new time change and my fiancee getting a new job it has thrown me off a bit so I have been going to the gym later. \n\nMy gym pretty much consists of the elderly (I'm 25 myself) with a few other gym goers my age. Now I go to the gym alone as I like having some quiet time and it's a good stress reliever for me. I also wanna add that I keep to myself. I dont talk to anyone or bother myself with other people because I just get in my own head. The reason I add this is because many of the older gym goers like to chat and hangout even when I would normally go at 7am. I really dont mind this aa they dont take up any gym equipment and are pleasant as far as I can tell. Now obviously since I'm at the gym a few hours later then I normally go a few people I dont normally see are here but I assume them to be locals but again I dont concern myself with others.\n\n\nSo now to the cause of me feeling like a asshole. I was doing cardio on the bike with my headphones in zoned out. A group of 2 elderly ladies and 2 eldery gentlemen are biking and chatting next to me I glance over and see they are passing panflets with \"Jesus will save you\" and such back and forth and one elderly gentleman has a vanilla envelope I assume full of them. Whatever right? Not bugging me and they all seemed happy and knew eachother. They walk away and I continue peddling along. After about 5 mins I feel a tap on my shoulder and it is one of the elderly ladies. With a big smile on her face she tries to hand me a panflit, I  shake my head and say \"no thank you\" and face forward again. She then taps me again and motions for me to take my headphones off. I do and say, a little for annoyed, \"yes?\" She then says \"you should take this hun, you look like you need saving\" . I was pretty shocked but responded with \" I dont need anything thing from you maam\" and put my headphone back in. \n\n\nNow i thought that would be it but not 2 mins later she comes back with 2 of the older gentleman. They tap me on the shoulder again and berate me for being rude and not accepting the lords light into me and how I should be ashamed blah blah blah. I dont get to say anything before they walk away. I do however go right to the front desk and ask to speak to a manager.\n\nI explained to her exactly what happened and how it was pretty shocking and if something could be said to them so it doesn't happen again. She then informs her this isnt the first time it has been reported and let's me know she will handle it. I walk out and go back to my bike. She then comes out, gathers the 3 people who spoke to me, old lady included, and kicks them out. \n\nThey actually start pleading and apologizing and looked genuinely upset. I heard them offer to apologize but the manager had none of it. I now feel awful and didnt mean to have them kicked out or worse AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for getting a group of elderly people kicked out of the gym. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author goes to the gym and usually likes the quiet. They mention that they keep to themselves and don't engage with others. Then there's a group of elderly people passing out religious pamphlets. The author is on a bike, has headphones on, and the ladies approach them. The first time, the author declines. Then the lady comes back with others, they get more confrontational, and the author goes to the manager. The manager kicks them out after previous reports. The author feels bad because the group seemed upset and offered to apologize.\n\nSo, the main points here: the elderly group was handing out religious materials, which they had done before. The author was uncomfortable and approached the manager. The manager had already been informed of previous incidents. The key question is whether the author was in the wrong for reporting them.\n\nLegally, in many places, religious solicitation in public spaces like gyms can be regulated. If the gym's policy prohibits solicitation or harassment, then the group might be violating those rules. The author wasn't aggressive; they declined politely. The group escalated by confronting the author again, which might have crossed a line. The manager had prior reports, so the action was justified. The author's intent was to maintain their personal space and gym's rules. They didn't do anything illegal themselves. The manager's decision to kick them out based on existing policies means the author isn't in the wrong. They followed proper channels. The elderly group's behavior, especially after being refused, might be the issue. So, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
