I usually go in around 6 or 7 and I'm out by 9ish. With the new time change and my fiancee getting a new job it has thrown me off a bit so I have been going to the gym later. \n\nMy gym pretty much consists of the elderly (I'm 25 myself) with a few other gym goers my age. Now I go to the gym alone as I like having some quiet time and it's a good stress reliever for me. I also wanna add that I keep to myself. I dont talk to anyone or bother myself with other people because I just get in my own head. The reason I add this is because many of the older gym goers like to chat and hangout even when I would normally go at 7am. I really dont mind this aa they dont take up any gym equipment and are pleasant as far as I can tell. Now obviously since I'm at the gym a few hours later then I normally go a few people I dont normally see are here but I assume them to be locals but again I dont concern myself with others.\n\n\nSo now to the cause of me feeling like a asshole. I was doing cardio on the bike with my headphones in zoned out. A group of 2 elderly ladies and 2 eldery gentlemen are biking and chatting next to me I glance over and see they are passing panflets with \"Jesus will save you\" and such back and forth and one elderly gentleman has a vanilla envelope I assume full of them. Whatever right? Not bugging me and they all seemed happy and knew eachother. They walk away and I continue peddling along. After about 5 mins I feel a tap on my shoulder and it is one of the elderly ladies. With a big smile on her face she tries to hand me a panflit, I  shake my head and say \"no thank you\" and face forward again. She then taps me again and motions for me to take my headphones off. I do and say, a little for annoyed, \"yes?\" She then says \"you should take this hun, you look like you need saving\" . I was pretty shocked but responded with \" I dont need anything thing from you maam\" and put my headphone back in. \n\n\nNow i thought that would be it but not 2 mins later she comes back with 2 of the older gentleman. They tap me on the shoulder again and berate me for being rude and not accepting the lords light into me and how I should be ashamed blah blah blah. I dont get to say anything before they walk away. I do however go right to the front desk and ask to speak to a manager.\n\nI explained to her exactly what happened and how it was pretty shocking and if something could be said to them so it doesn't happen again. She then informs her this isnt the first time it has been reported and let's me know she will handle it. I walk out and go back to my bike. She then comes out, gathers the 3 people who spoke to me, old lady included, and kicks them out. \n\nThey actually start pleading and apologizing and looked genuinely upset. I heard them offer to apologize but the manager had none of it. I now feel awful and didnt mean to have them kicked out or worse AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author being at the gym, where a group of elderly people approached them with religious pamphlets. The author initially declined politely but then the group insisted, leading the author to report them to the manager, who then kicked them out. The author now feels bad about this outcome.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The gym is a public space, and while people have the right to free speech, including religious proselytizing, there are also rules about harassment or disturbing others. The key points here are the persistence of the elderly group after the author refused the first time. The author was in their own space, using the bike with headphones on, and then was repeatedly approached and verbally reprimanded for not accepting the pamphlets. The manager had prior reports, which suggests this might be a recurring issue.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in many places, you can't be forced to accept literature, but the line is crossed when it becomes harassment. The elderly group's actions escalated from simply passing out pamphlets to berating the author for declining. This escalation could be seen as harassment, which the gym management has the right to address. \n\nThe author's reaction was to report the behavior, which is a reasonable step when they feel harassed. The manager's decision to intervene and kick them out was likely based on existing policies and prior reports. The author didn't physically confront them but sought help through the proper channel. \n\nHowever, the author might feel guilty because they're aware of the age of the individuals and the emotional impact of being asked to leave. The elderly group did apologize and plead, which could make the author question their action. But the manager's role is to maintain a safe and respectful environment for all patrons. \n\nIn terms of social norms, while being assertive in declining solicitation is acceptable, the group's persistence and berating crossed a line. The author's request for the manager to address the behavior was appropriate. \n\nSo, considering all factors\u2014the escalation of behavior, prior reports, the manager's intervention, and the author's attempt to resolve it through proper channels\u2014it seems the author isn't in the wrong. The elderly group's actions warranted the manager's response. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
