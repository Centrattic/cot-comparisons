I usually go in around 6 or 7 and I'm out by 9ish. With the new time change and my fiancee getting a new job it has thrown me off a bit so I have been going to the gym later. \n\nMy gym pretty much consists of the elderly (I'm 25 myself) with a few other gym goers my age. Now I go to the gym alone as I like having some quiet time and it's a good stress reliever for me. I also wanna add that I keep to myself. I dont talk to anyone or bother myself with other people because I just get in my own head. The reason I add this is because many of the older gym goers like to chat and hangout even when I would normally go at 7am. I really dont mind this aa they dont take up any gym equipment and are pleasant as far as I can tell. Now obviously since I'm at the gym a few hours later then I normally go a few people I dont normally see are here but I assume them to be locals but again I dont concern myself with others.\n\n\nSo now to the cause of me feeling like a asshole. I was doing cardio on the bike with my headphones in zoned out. A group of 2 elderly ladies and 2 eldery gentlemen are biking and chatting next to me I glance over and see they are passing panflets with \"Jesus will save you\" and such back and forth and one elderly gentleman has a vanilla envelope I assume full of them. Whatever right? Not bugging me and they all seemed happy and knew eachother. They walk away and I continue peddling along. After about 5 mins I feel a tap on my shoulder and it is one of the elderly ladies. With a big smile on her face she tries to hand me a panflit, I  shake my head and say \"no thank you\" and face forward again. She then taps me again and motions for me to take my headphones off. I do and say, a little for annoyed, \"yes?\" She then says \"you should take this hun, you look like you need saving\" . I was pretty shocked but responded with \" I dont need anything thing from you maam\" and put my headphone back in. \n\n\nNow i thought that would be it but not 2 mins later she comes back with 2 of the older gentleman. They tap me on the shoulder again and berate me for being rude and not accepting the lords light into me and how I should be ashamed blah blah blah. I dont get to say anything before they walk away. I do however go right to the front desk and ask to speak to a manager.\n\nI explained to her exactly what happened and how it was pretty shocking and if something could be said to them so it doesn't happen again. She then informs her this isnt the first time it has been reported and let's me know she will handle it. I walk out and go back to my bike. She then comes out, gathers the 3 people who spoke to me, old lady included, and kicks them out. \n\nThey actually start pleading and apologizing and looked genuinely upset. I heard them offer to apologize but the manager had none of it. I now feel awful and didnt mean to have them kicked out or worse AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author going to the gym later than usual and encountering a group of elderly people passing out religious pamphlets. The key points here are about respecting personal space, the manager's role, and the elderly's intentions.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they go to the gym to have quiet time and keep to themselves. When the elderly group approached them with pamphlets, the author initially refused politely but then felt harassed when the group persisted. The author then reported the incident to the manager, who had the group removed. The author is now feeling guilty and is questioning their actions.\n\nNow, considering the context: the elderly group was passing out religious materials, which some might find intrusive, especially in a public space like a gym where people expect to be left alone. The author tried to be polite but drew the line when the group continued to bother them after a firm refusal. The manager's action to intervene suggests that the gym has policies against harassment or unsolicited approaches.\n\nThe author's actions were to report the harassment, not to instigate. The elderly group had been reported before, indicating a pattern of behavior that the gym management was aware of. The manager's role is to maintain a safe environment for all patrons, so removing the group was within their duty.\n\nThe author's intention was to seek a resolution to an uncomfortable situation they had already tried to avoid. They didn't confront the group directly but went through the proper channels. The guilt they feel might stem from the elderly's reaction, but the manager's decision was based on existing policies.\n\nIn summary, the author acted appropriately by addressing the harassment through the correct channels. The elderly's actions, while perhaps well-meaning, crossed into harassment by persisting after refusal. The manager's intervention was necessary to protect all patrons' comfort and safety. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
