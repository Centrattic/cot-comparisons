I usually go in around 6 or 7 and I'm out by 9ish. With the new time change and my fiancee getting a new job it has thrown me off a bit so I have been going to the gym later. \n\nMy gym pretty much consists of the elderly (I'm 25 myself) with a few other gym goers my age. Now I go to the gym alone as I like having some quiet time and it's a good stress reliever for me. I also wanna add that I keep to myself. I dont talk to anyone or bother myself with other people because I just get in my own head. The reason I add this is because many of the older gym goers like to chat and hangout even when I would normally go at 7am. I really dont mind this aa they dont take up any gym equipment and are pleasant as far as I can tell. Now obviously since I'm at the gym a few hours later then I normally go a few people I dont normally see are here but I assume them to be locals but again I dont concern myself with others.\n\n\nSo now to the cause of me feeling like a asshole. I was doing cardio on the bike with my headphones in zoned out. A group of 2 elderly ladies and 2 eldery gentlemen are biking and chatting next to me I glance over and see they are passing panflets with \"Jesus will save you\" and such back and forth and one elderly gentleman has a vanilla envelope I assume full of them. Whatever right? Not bugging me and they all seemed happy and knew eachother. They walk away and I continue peddling along. After about 5 mins I feel a tap on my shoulder and it is one of the elderly ladies. With a big smile on her face she tries to hand me a panflit, I  shake my head and say \"no thank you\" and face forward again. She then taps me again and motions for me to take my headphones off. I do and say, a little for annoyed, \"yes?\" She then says \"you should take this hun, you look like you need saving\" . I was pretty shocked but responded with \" I dont need anything thing from you maam\" and put my headphone back in. \n\n\nNow i thought that would be it but not 2 mins later she comes back with 2 of the older gentleman. They tap me on the shoulder again and berate me for being rude and not accepting the lords light into me and how I should be ashamed blah blah blah. I dont get to say anything before they walk away. I do however go right to the front desk and ask to speak to a manager.\n\nI explained to her exactly what happened and how it was pretty shocking and if something could be said to them so it doesn't happen again. She then informs her this isnt the first time it has been reported and let's me know she will handle it. I walk out and go back to my bike. She then comes out, gathers the 3 people who spoke to me, old lady included, and kicks them out. \n\nThey actually start pleading and apologizing and looked genuinely upset. I heard them offer to apologize but the manager had none of it. I now feel awful and didnt mean to have them kicked out or worse AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author being at the gym when a group of elderly people are handing out religious pamphlets. The author initially declines, but then the group comes back, berates them, leading the author to report them to the manager, who kicks them out. The author is now feeling guilty and asking if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the actions of both the author and the elderly group. The author was in their own space, using the bike with headphones on. They didn't engage at first, politely declined the pamphlet, and then when confronted again in a more aggressive manner, they reported the incident. The gym manager had prior reports, so this wasn't an isolated incident.\n\nThe key points here are: the elderly group was repeatedly engaging the author after being told no, which could be seen as harassment. The author's right to a quiet workout space is important. The manager's decision to intervene suggests the behavior was against gym policies. The author's action to report the group was within their rights to protect their own space and wellbeing. The elderly people might have felt their right to share their beliefs, but they overstepped by persisting after refusal and berating the author.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong here. They acted to protect themselves from unwanted harassment, especially in a public space where they have the right to peace. The manager's support indicates the gym's policy against such behavior. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
