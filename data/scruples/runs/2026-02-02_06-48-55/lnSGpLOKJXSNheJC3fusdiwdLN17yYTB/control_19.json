I usually go in around 6 or 7 and I'm out by 9ish. With the new time change and my fiancee getting a new job it has thrown me off a bit so I have been going to the gym later. \n\nMy gym pretty much consists of the elderly (I'm 25 myself) with a few other gym goers my age. Now I go to the gym alone as I like having some quiet time and it's a good stress reliever for me. I also wanna add that I keep to myself. I dont talk to anyone or bother myself with other people because I just get in my own head. The reason I add this is because many of the older gym goers like to chat and hangout even when I would normally go at 7am. I really dont mind this aa they dont take up any gym equipment and are pleasant as far as I can tell. Now obviously since I'm at the gym a few hours later then I normally go a few people I dont normally see are here but I assume them to be locals but again I dont concern myself with others.\n\n\nSo now to the cause of me feeling like a asshole. I was doing cardio on the bike with my headphones in zoned out. A group of 2 elderly ladies and 2 eldery gentlemen are biking and chatting next to me I glance over and see they are passing panflets with \"Jesus will save you\" and such back and forth and one elderly gentleman has a vanilla envelope I assume full of them. Whatever right? Not bugging me and they all seemed happy and knew eachother. They walk away and I continue peddling along. After about 5 mins I feel a tap on my shoulder and it is one of the elderly ladies. With a big smile on her face she tries to hand me a panflit, I  shake my head and say \"no thank you\" and face forward again. She then taps me again and motions for me to take my headphones off. I do and say, a little for annoyed, \"yes?\" She then says \"you should take this hun, you look like you need saving\" . I was pretty shocked but responded with \" I dont need anything thing from you maam\" and put my headphone back in. \n\n\nNow i thought that would be it but not 2 mins later she comes back with 2 of the older gentleman. They tap me on the shoulder again and berate me for being rude and not accepting the lords light into me and how I should be ashamed blah blah blah. I dont get to say anything before they walk away. I do however go right to the front desk and ask to speak to a manager.\n\nI explained to her exactly what happened and how it was pretty shocking and if something could be said to them so it doesn't happen again. She then informs her this isnt the first time it has been reported and let's me know she will handle it. I walk out and go back to my bike. She then comes out, gathers the 3 people who spoke to me, old lady included, and kicks them out. \n\nThey actually start pleading and apologizing and looked genuinely upset. I heard them offer to apologize but the manager had none of it. I now feel awful and didnt mean to have them kicked out or worse AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting a group of elderly people kicked out of the gym after refusing their religious materials. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author goes to the gym later than usual, encounters a group of elderly people who are passing out religious pamphlets. The author is on the bike with headphones on, and when approached, politely declines. Then the group comes back, confronts the author again, leading the author to report them to management, resulting in their expulsion.\n\nThe main question is about whether the author acted wrong. Let's consider the key points. The gym is a public space, and while religious proselytizing can be a sensitive issue, the key here is whether the group was being aggressive or violating gym policies. The author mentions that they were initially not bothered by the group chatting, but when they started handing out pamphlets and persisted after refusal, the author felt uncomfortable. The manager had already been informed of previous incidents, which suggests that this might be a recurring issue.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in many places, individuals have the right to free speech, including distributing religious materials, unless it's against specific rules of the establishment. However, if the gym has a policy against solicitation or harassment, then the management's action could be justified. The author approached the manager and reported the incident, which is a reasonable step if they felt harassed or if the gym had prior complaints.\n\nThe elderly group did escalate by confronting the author again after being refused, which could be seen as harassment or pestering. The manager's decision to remove them might be based on existing policies to maintain a respectful environment for all members. The author's actions were in line with seeking resolution through proper channels, so they aren't necessarily at fault here.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author could have handled it differently, like ignoring the group or moving to another area. But given that the manager was already aware and had acted, it's possible that the group's behavior was a repeat offense. The author's primary concern was their own comfort and safety, which is valid.\n\nIn summary, the author's actions in reporting the situation to management, especially after previous incidents, are justified. The elderly group's persistence after being refused might have crossed into harassment, making the management's intervention appropriate. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
