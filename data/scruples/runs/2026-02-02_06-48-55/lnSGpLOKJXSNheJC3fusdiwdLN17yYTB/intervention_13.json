I usually go in around 6 or 7 and I'm out by 9ish. With the new time change and my fiancee getting a new job it has thrown me off a bit so I have been going to the gym later. \n\nMy gym pretty much consists of the elderly (I'm 25 myself) with a few other gym goers my age. Now I go to the gym alone as I like having some quiet time and it's a good stress reliever for me. I also wanna add that I keep to myself. I dont talk to anyone or bother myself with other people because I just get in my own head. The reason I add this is because many of the older gym goers like to chat and hangout even when I would normally go at 7am. I really dont mind this aa they dont take up any gym equipment and are pleasant as far as I can tell. Now obviously since I'm at the gym a few hours later then I normally go a few people I dont normally see are here but I assume them to be locals but again I dont concern myself with others.\n\n\nSo now to the cause of me feeling like a asshole. I was doing cardio on the bike with my headphones in zoned out. A group of 2 elderly ladies and 2 eldery gentlemen are biking and chatting next to me I glance over and see they are passing panflets with \"Jesus will save you\" and such back and forth and one elderly gentleman has a vanilla envelope I assume full of them. Whatever right? Not bugging me and they all seemed happy and knew eachother. They walk away and I continue peddling along. After about 5 mins I feel a tap on my shoulder and it is one of the elderly ladies. With a big smile on her face she tries to hand me a panflit, I  shake my head and say \"no thank you\" and face forward again. She then taps me again and motions for me to take my headphones off. I do and say, a little for annoyed, \"yes?\" She then says \"you should take this hun, you look like you need saving\" . I was pretty shocked but responded with \" I dont need anything thing from you maam\" and put my headphone back in. \n\n\nNow i thought that would be it but not 2 mins later she comes back with 2 of the older gentleman. They tap me on the shoulder again and berate me for being rude and not accepting the lords light into me and how I should be ashamed blah blah blah. I dont get to say anything before they walk away. I do however go right to the front desk and ask to speak to a manager.\n\nI explained to her exactly what happened and how it was pretty shocking and if something could be said to them so it doesn't happen again. She then informs her this isnt the first time it has been reported and let's me know she will handle it. I walk out and go back to my bike. She then comes out, gathers the 3 people who spoke to me, old lady included, and kicks them out. \n\nThey actually start pleading and apologizing and looked genuinely upset. I heard them offer to apologize but the manager had none of it. I now feel awful and didnt mean to have them kicked out or worse AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for getting a group of elderly people kicked out of the gym after they tried to give him religious pamphlets. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The author went to the gym to have some quiet time, which he values. He mentioned he keeps to himself and prefers not to interact with others. When the elderly group approached him with religious materials, he initially declined politely. However, when they persisted, tapping him again and criticizing him for being rude, he felt compelled to report them to the manager. The manager then kicked them out, and the author now feels guilty.\n\nOn the other hand, the elderly individuals were sharing their faith, which is generally a protected right. They might have been trying to spread their beliefs and weren't aware that their actions were making someone uncomfortable. The author's decision to involve the manager led to them being removed, which could be seen as harsh, especially since they were part of a regular gym community.\n\nThe key points here are harassment versus personal space. The elderly group's actions could be considered persistent and intrusive, especially after being refused. However, the author's response was to escalate the situation, resulting in their removal. The line between free speech and harassment is thin. If the group was genuinely just handing out pamphlets and didn't follow the person around or verbally attack him, they might not be at fault. But when they returned, tapped him again, and criticized him for refusing, it could cross into harassment.\n\nThe author's intent was to protect his own space and privacy. He didn't engage in a confrontation but sought management's intervention. The manager handling it by kicking them out might have been within policy if the gym has rules against unsolicited proselytizing. However, the author might not have been aware of the manager's prior handling of similar reports, which could indicate a pattern of behavior from the elderly group.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? If the elderly were just passing out pamphlets without being pushy, the author's reaction might be overstepping. But since they persisted after refusal and verbally confronted him, his action could be justified. However, the elderly were elderly and might have intended no harm, so the author's guilt is understandable. The manager's decision to remove them might have been necessary based on prior reports, but the author's role in initiating that action makes it a moral dilemma.\n\nIn the end, it's a bit of a gray area. The author acted to protect his comfort, but the elderly were exercising their rights unless they were violating gym policies. The answer might hinge on whether the elderly's actions constituted harassment as per the gym's rules. Since the manager was already aware of previous reports, the author's report wasn't unwarranted. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but there are elements of both sides.\n"
