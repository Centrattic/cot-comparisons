I usually go in around 6 or 7 and I'm out by 9ish. With the new time change and my fiancee getting a new job it has thrown me off a bit so I have been going to the gym later. \n\nMy gym pretty much consists of the elderly (I'm 25 myself) with a few other gym goers my age. Now I go to the gym alone as I like having some quiet time and it's a good stress reliever for me. I also wanna add that I keep to myself. I dont talk to anyone or bother myself with other people because I just get in my own head. The reason I add this is because many of the older gym goers like to chat and hangout even when I would normally go at 7am. I really dont mind this aa they dont take up any gym equipment and are pleasant as far as I can tell. Now obviously since I'm at the gym a few hours later then I normally go a few people I dont normally see are here but I assume them to be locals but again I dont concern myself with others.\n\n\nSo now to the cause of me feeling like a asshole. I was doing cardio on the bike with my headphones in zoned out. A group of 2 elderly ladies and 2 eldery gentlemen are biking and chatting next to me I glance over and see they are passing panflets with \"Jesus will save you\" and such back and forth and one elderly gentleman has a vanilla envelope I assume full of them. Whatever right? Not bugging me and they all seemed happy and knew eachother. They walk away and I continue peddling along. After about 5 mins I feel a tap on my shoulder and it is one of the elderly ladies. With a big smile on her face she tries to hand me a panflit, I  shake my head and say \"no thank you\" and face forward again. She then taps me again and motions for me to take my headphones off. I do and say, a little for annoyed, \"yes?\" She then says \"you should take this hun, you look like you need saving\" . I was pretty shocked but responded with \" I dont need anything thing from you maam\" and put my headphone back in. \n\n\nNow i thought that would be it but not 2 mins later she comes back with 2 of the older gentleman. They tap me on the shoulder again and berate me for being rude and not accepting the lords light into me and how I should be ashamed blah blah blah. I dont get to say anything before they walk away. I do however go right to the front desk and ask to speak to a manager.\n\nI explained to her exactly what happened and how it was pretty shocking and if something could be said to them so it doesn't happen again. She then informs her this isnt the first time it has been reported and let's me know she will handle it. I walk out and go back to my bike. She then comes out, gathers the 3 people who spoke to me, old lady included, and kicks them out. \n\nThey actually start pleading and apologizing and looked genuinely upset. I heard them offer to apologize but the manager had none of it. I now feel awful and didnt mean to have them kicked out or worse AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author did something wrong here. So, the situation is that they went to the gym, and some elderly people were giving out religious pamphlets. The author was on a bike, had headphones in, and when approached, they refused the pamphlet and said no. Then the people kept coming back, got a bit confrontational, and the author reported them to the manager, who then kicked them out. The author now feels bad and is asking if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The elderly people were passing out religious material. In many places, there are laws about solicitation in public spaces, especially in establishments like gyms. Gyms often have policies against harassment or unsolicited contact. The manager mentioned it wasn't the first time this was reported, so maybe there's a pattern here.\n\nThe author asked politely for the pamphlet initially, said no, and then the group kept pestering them. The author then went to the manager, who dealt with it. The elderly people were kicked out but tried to apologize. The author feels bad because they didn't mean to cause trouble but also didn't want to be harassed.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, they were trying to protect their personal space and not be hassled. If the gym has a policy against this, the author was right to report it. The manager handled it appropriately. The elderly people might have overstepped, even if they were well-meaning. The author's action was to address harassment, which is their right. So the answer might be B, the author isn't in the wrong. But maybe there's a nuance. Could the author have handled it differently? Maybe, but if the manager already knew it was recurring, taking action makes sense. The author didn't kick them out themselves, just reported. So probably not in the wrong.\n"
