I usually go in around 6 or 7 and I'm out by 9ish. With the new time change and my fiancee getting a new job it has thrown me off a bit so I have been going to the gym later. \n\nMy gym pretty much consists of the elderly (I'm 25 myself) with a few other gym goers my age. Now I go to the gym alone as I like having some quiet time and it's a good stress reliever for me. I also wanna add that I keep to myself. I dont talk to anyone or bother myself with other people because I just get in my own head. The reason I add this is because many of the older gym goers like to chat and hangout even when I would normally go at 7am. I really dont mind this aa they dont take up any gym equipment and are pleasant as far as I can tell. Now obviously since I'm at the gym a few hours later then I normally go a few people I dont normally see are here but I assume them to be locals but again I dont concern myself with others.\n\n\nSo now to the cause of me feeling like a asshole. I was doing cardio on the bike with my headphones in zoned out. A group of 2 elderly ladies and 2 eldery gentlemen are biking and chatting next to me I glance over and see they are passing panflets with \"Jesus will save you\" and such back and forth and one elderly gentleman has a vanilla envelope I assume full of them. Whatever right? Not bugging me and they all seemed happy and knew eachother. They walk away and I continue peddling along. After about 5 mins I feel a tap on my shoulder and it is one of the elderly ladies. With a big smile on her face she tries to hand me a panflit, I  shake my head and say \"no thank you\" and face forward again. She then taps me again and motions for me to take my headphones off. I do and say, a little for annoyed, \"yes?\" She then says \"you should take this hun, you look like you need saving\" . I was pretty shocked but responded with \" I dont need anything thing from you maam\" and put my headphone back in. \n\n\nNow i thought that would be it but not 2 mins later she comes back with 2 of the older gentleman. They tap me on the shoulder again and berate me for being rude and not accepting the lords light into me and how I should be ashamed blah blah blah. I dont get to say anything before they walk away. I do however go right to the front desk and ask to speak to a manager.\n\nI explained to her exactly what happened and how it was pretty shocking and if something could be said to them so it doesn't happen again. She then informs her this isnt the first time it has been reported and let's me know she will handle it. I walk out and go back to my bike. She then comes out, gathers the 3 people who spoke to me, old lady included, and kicks them out. \n\nThey actually start pleading and apologizing and looked genuinely upset. I heard them offer to apologize but the manager had none of it. I now feel awful and didnt mean to have them kicked out or worse AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for getting some elderly people kicked out of the gym after they tried to give them religious pamphlets. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation from both sides. The author is at the gym, using a bike, and there's a group of elderly people nearby. They're passing around religious material and then one of them approaches the author and tries to give them a pamphlet. The author declines, but then the group comes back later, reprimands the author for being rude, and the author goes to the manager who kicks them out. Now the author feels bad and is wondering if they're the asshole.\n\nSo, the key points here are about harassment and the right to free speech. In many places, proselytizing in public spaces, like a gym, is considered protected speech under the First Amendment in the US, for example. However, there can be limits if it's deemed harassment or if it's not solicited and becomes intrusive. \n\nThe author was in a public space and had the right to refuse the pamphlets. The elderly people approached the author twice, even after the author refused once. The second time, they came with others and berated the author for being rude. That might cross the line into harassment, especially if it's persistent and confrontational. \n\nThe manager had already been informed about this before, which suggests that the behavior might have been a recurring issue. If that's the case, the gym might have a policy against such repeated disturbances. The manager's action to remove them could be justified if the behavior was violating gym policies on harassment or respectful conduct.\n\nBut let's consider the elderly people's perspective. They were just trying to share their beliefs, which is a common practice in many religions. However, if they were being persistent and confrontational, especially after the initial refusal, that might be seen as overstepping. The author's reaction to go to the manager after being berated could be a reasonable self-defense of personal space and right to be left alone.\n\nThe author didn't approach the group first; they were approached. The author's main issue was that the group was being pushy and then criticized them for not accepting the pamphlets. In such cases, individuals have the right to decline without facing harassment. \n\nSo, whether the author is in the wrong depends on local laws and gym policies. If the gym's policy prohibits harassment or unsolicited solicitation, then the manager's action was appropriate. The author reporting the issue is a valid action self-advocacy, not inherently wrong. The elderly people might have overstepped by continuing to engage after being refused and then reprimanding the author, which could be seen as aggressive behavior.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for seeking a resolution through the gym's management. They were responding to what they perceived as harassment after multiple approaches. The manager's previous reports indicate that this wasn't an isolated incident, so the removal might have been a necessary action to maintain a respectful environment for all members.\n"
