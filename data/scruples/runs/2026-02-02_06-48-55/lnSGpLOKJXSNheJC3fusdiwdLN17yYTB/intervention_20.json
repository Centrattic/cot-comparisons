I usually go in around 6 or 7 and I'm out by 9ish. With the new time change and my fiancee getting a new job it has thrown me off a bit so I have been going to the gym later. \n\nMy gym pretty much consists of the elderly (I'm 25 myself) with a few other gym goers my age. Now I go to the gym alone as I like having some quiet time and it's a good stress reliever for me. I also wanna add that I keep to myself. I dont talk to anyone or bother myself with other people because I just get in my own head. The reason I add this is because many of the older gym goers like to chat and hangout even when I would normally go at 7am. I really dont mind this aa they dont take up any gym equipment and are pleasant as far as I can tell. Now obviously since I'm at the gym a few hours later then I normally go a few people I dont normally see are here but I assume them to be locals but again I dont concern myself with others.\n\n\nSo now to the cause of me feeling like a asshole. I was doing cardio on the bike with my headphones in zoned out. A group of 2 elderly ladies and 2 eldery gentlemen are biking and chatting next to me I glance over and see they are passing panflets with \"Jesus will save you\" and such back and forth and one elderly gentleman has a vanilla envelope I assume full of them. Whatever right? Not bugging me and they all seemed happy and knew eachother. They walk away and I continue peddling along. After about 5 mins I feel a tap on my shoulder and it is one of the elderly ladies. With a big smile on her face she tries to hand me a panflit, I  shake my head and say \"no thank you\" and face forward again. She then taps me again and motions for me to take my headphones off. I do and say, a little for annoyed, \"yes?\" She then says \"you should take this hun, you look like you need saving\" . I was pretty shocked but responded with \" I dont need anything thing from you maam\" and put my headphone back in. \n\n\nNow i thought that would be it but not 2 mins later she comes back with 2 of the older gentleman. They tap me on the shoulder again and berate me for being rude and not accepting the lords light into me and how I should be ashamed blah blah blah. I dont get to say anything before they walk away. I do however go right to the front desk and ask to speak to a manager.\n\nI explained to her exactly what happened and how it was pretty shocking and if something could be said to them so it doesn't happen again. She then informs her this isnt the first time it has been reported and let's me know she will handle it. I walk out and go back to my bike. She then comes out, gathers the 3 people who spoke to me, old lady included, and kicks them out. \n\nThey actually start pleading and apologizing and looked genuinely upset. I heard them offer to apologize but the manager had none of it. I now feel awful and didnt mean to have them kicked out or worse AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting a group of elderly people kicked out of the gym for trying to give religious pamphlets. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was at the gym later than usual, which led to encountering these elderly people who were passing out religious material. When approached, the author refused the pamphlet and then was confronted again by the group, leading to the author reporting them to the manager.\n\nThe key points here are: \n1. The elderly people were passing out religious material in a public space (the gym), which is generally allowed unless prohibited by the establishment's rules.\n2. The author felt harassed or uncomfortable, leading to their decision to report the group.\n3. The manager had previously been informed of similar incidents, indicating a possible ongoing issue.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, unless the gym has a strict policy against proselytizing, the elderly individuals might not have been violating any rules. However, the manager's prior knowledge suggests that the gym might consider such behavior disruptive. The author's reaction was to seek management's intervention, which resulted in the group being asked to leave.\n\nMoral considerations come into play here. The author didn't engage in the conversation and used a polite refusal. The elderly group, however, took it further by confronting the author again and potentially making them feel harassed. The manager's decision to remove them was based on prior reports, which implies that the gym management had concerns about such behavior.\n\nThe author might feel they were in the right to report the group due to feeling pressured. However, some might argue that the elderly individuals were only trying to share their beliefs and that the author overreacted. On the other hand, the repeated approach and confrontation could be seen as intrusive, especially in a place like a gym where people expect to be left alone.\n\nThe manager's role is to enforce the gym's policies. If the gym allows religious materials, the author might have overstepped. But if there's a policy against it, the author acted appropriately. The manager's prior reports indicate that this wasn't an isolated incident, suggesting that the gym had valid concerns.\n\nIn terms of accountability, the author might not be in the wrong if the gym's policies support the removal. However, if the gym allows such activities, then the author could be seen as interfering with others' rights. The elderly group's behavior was pushy, but the solution was handled by the management, which the author didn't directly cause.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions were within their rights to report the behavior if the gym's policies support it. Since the manager had prior reports, the removal was likely justified. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
