I usually go in around 6 or 7 and I'm out by 9ish. With the new time change and my fiancee getting a new job it has thrown me off a bit so I have been going to the gym later. \n\nMy gym pretty much consists of the elderly (I'm 25 myself) with a few other gym goers my age. Now I go to the gym alone as I like having some quiet time and it's a good stress reliever for me. I also wanna add that I keep to myself. I dont talk to anyone or bother myself with other people because I just get in my own head. The reason I add this is because many of the older gym goers like to chat and hangout even when I would normally go at 7am. I really dont mind this aa they dont take up any gym equipment and are pleasant as far as I can tell. Now obviously since I'm at the gym a few hours later then I normally go a few people I dont normally see are here but I assume them to be locals but again I dont concern myself with others.\n\n\nSo now to the cause of me feeling like a asshole. I was doing cardio on the bike with my headphones in zoned out. A group of 2 elderly ladies and 2 eldery gentlemen are biking and chatting next to me I glance over and see they are passing panflets with \"Jesus will save you\" and such back and forth and one elderly gentleman has a vanilla envelope I assume full of them. Whatever right? Not bugging me and they all seemed happy and knew eachother. They walk away and I continue peddling along. After about 5 mins I feel a tap on my shoulder and it is one of the elderly ladies. With a big smile on her face she tries to hand me a panflit, I  shake my head and say \"no thank you\" and face forward again. She then taps me again and motions for me to take my headphones off. I do and say, a little for annoyed, \"yes?\" She then says \"you should take this hun, you look like you need saving\" . I was pretty shocked but responded with \" I dont need anything thing from you maam\" and put my headphone back in. \n\n\nNow i thought that would be it but not 2 mins later she comes back with 2 of the older gentleman. They tap me on the shoulder again and berate me for being rude and not accepting the lords light into me and how I should be ashamed blah blah blah. I dont get to say anything before they walk away. I do however go right to the front desk and ask to speak to a manager.\n\nI explained to her exactly what happened and how it was pretty shocking and if something could be said to them so it doesn't happen again. She then informs her this isnt the first time it has been reported and let's me know she will handle it. I walk out and go back to my bike. She then comes out, gathers the 3 people who spoke to me, old lady included, and kicks them out. \n\nThey actually start pleading and apologizing and looked genuinely upset. I heard them offer to apologize but the manager had none of it. I now feel awful and didnt mean to have them kicked out or worse AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong in this situation. So the person went to the gym, which has a lot of elderly people. They usually go alone and like the quiet time. Then, a group of elderly people started passing out religious pamphlets. The author was on the bike with headphones, and when they tried to decline the pamphlet, the elderly people kept trying to engage them, even after the author said no. The author then went to the manager, who said it wasn't the first time this happened and kicked them out. The author is now feeling bad and wondering if they did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The gym is a public space, and people have the right to express their beliefs, but there are limits when it comes to harassment or unwanted solicitation. The elderly individuals were passing out pamphlets and approaching the author multiple times after they declined. The author tried to be polite, saying \"no thank you\" and even removing their headphones to avoid further interaction. However, the elderly group continued, even bringing others to \"berate\" the author for being rude. This could be seen as persistent and potentially harassing behavior, especially in a place where the author is trying to relax.\n\nThe key points here are consent and the right to privacy. The author was in their space, trying to work out, and the elderly group was imposing on that space without invitation. Religious proselytizing in public places is generally protected, but it's not allowed if it's intrusive or disruptive. The manager's response was based on previous reports, indicating that this might be a recurring issue affecting others as well.\n\nOn the other hand, the elderly individuals did seem to apologize and offer to make amends, which might suggest they didn't intend to cause harm. But the author's actions led to them being removed from the gym, which could be harsh if the manager handled it differently. However, the manager was the one who made the decision after being informed of the incident, so the author was just reporting a problem they experienced.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions were a response to unwanted and persistent behavior that disrupted their personal space and time at the gym. They had a right to feel uncomfortable and to seek assistance from management. The manager's decision to remove the group suggests that the gym has policies against such behavior. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong here because they were protecting their own space and following the gym's rules as enforced by management.\n"
