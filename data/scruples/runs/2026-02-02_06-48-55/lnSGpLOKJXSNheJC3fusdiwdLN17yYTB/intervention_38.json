I usually go in around 6 or 7 and I'm out by 9ish. With the new time change and my fiancee getting a new job it has thrown me off a bit so I have been going to the gym later. \n\nMy gym pretty much consists of the elderly (I'm 25 myself) with a few other gym goers my age. Now I go to the gym alone as I like having some quiet time and it's a good stress reliever for me. I also wanna add that I keep to myself. I dont talk to anyone or bother myself with other people because I just get in my own head. The reason I add this is because many of the older gym goers like to chat and hangout even when I would normally go at 7am. I really dont mind this aa they dont take up any gym equipment and are pleasant as far as I can tell. Now obviously since I'm at the gym a few hours later then I normally go a few people I dont normally see are here but I assume them to be locals but again I dont concern myself with others.\n\n\nSo now to the cause of me feeling like a asshole. I was doing cardio on the bike with my headphones in zoned out. A group of 2 elderly ladies and 2 eldery gentlemen are biking and chatting next to me I glance over and see they are passing panflets with \"Jesus will save you\" and such back and forth and one elderly gentleman has a vanilla envelope I assume full of them. Whatever right? Not bugging me and they all seemed happy and knew eachother. They walk away and I continue peddling along. After about 5 mins I feel a tap on my shoulder and it is one of the elderly ladies. With a big smile on her face she tries to hand me a panflit, I  shake my head and say \"no thank you\" and face forward again. She then taps me again and motions for me to take my headphones off. I do and say, a little for annoyed, \"yes?\" She then says \"you should take this hun, you look like you need saving\" . I was pretty shocked but responded with \" I dont need anything thing from you maam\" and put my headphone back in. \n\n\nNow i thought that would be it but not 2 mins later she comes back with 2 of the older gentleman. They tap me on the shoulder again and berate me for being rude and not accepting the lords light into me and how I should be ashamed blah blah blah. I dont get to say anything before they walk away. I do however go right to the front desk and ask to speak to a manager.\n\nI explained to her exactly what happened and how it was pretty shocking and if something could be said to them so it doesn't happen again. She then informs her this isnt the first time it has been reported and let's me know she will handle it. I walk out and go back to my bike. She then comes out, gathers the 3 people who spoke to me, old lady included, and kicks them out. \n\nThey actually start pleading and apologizing and looked genuinely upset. I heard them offer to apologize but the manager had none of it. I now feel awful and didnt mean to have them kicked out or worse AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author getting a group of elderly gym members kicked out after they tried to give religious pamphlets.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author went to the gym later than usual and encountered a group of elderly people who were passing out religious materials. The author initially declined the pamphlet and then later, when approached again by the group, expressed annoyance. The manager then kicked them out after the author reported the incident. The author now feels bad about it and is questioning their actions.\n\nThe key points here are about personal boundaries, harassment, and policies. The author was in their own space, using the gym, and the elderly group approached them multiple times after being denied. The manager mentioned it wasn't the first time this kind of thing happened, which implies there's a policy against such behavior. The author's main concern is whether they overreacted.\n\nOn one hand, the elderly people were trying to share their faith, which is a personal right, but in a public space like a gym, there are usually policies against solicitation or harassment. Repeatedly approaching someone who has already declined can be seen as harassment. The manager's action suggests that the gym has rules against this, and the author was within their rights to report it.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel guilty for causing the elderly people to be kicked out and even apologized. However, the author's right to a respectful environment should also be considered. The key is whether the author's actions were justified given the context. Since the manager confirmed it was not the first incident and acted accordingly, the author's report was a responsible action to uphold the gym's policies.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong because they addressed a repeated issue that was affecting their personal space and well-being. The manager's handling of the situation aligns with standard procedures for such complaints. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
