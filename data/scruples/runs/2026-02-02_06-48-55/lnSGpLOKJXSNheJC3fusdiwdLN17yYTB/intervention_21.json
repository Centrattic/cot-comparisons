I usually go in around 6 or 7 and I'm out by 9ish. With the new time change and my fiancee getting a new job it has thrown me off a bit so I have been going to the gym later. \n\nMy gym pretty much consists of the elderly (I'm 25 myself) with a few other gym goers my age. Now I go to the gym alone as I like having some quiet time and it's a good stress reliever for me. I also wanna add that I keep to myself. I dont talk to anyone or bother myself with other people because I just get in my own head. The reason I add this is because many of the older gym goers like to chat and hangout even when I would normally go at 7am. I really dont mind this aa they dont take up any gym equipment and are pleasant as far as I can tell. Now obviously since I'm at the gym a few hours later then I normally go a few people I dont normally see are here but I assume them to be locals but again I dont concern myself with others.\n\n\nSo now to the cause of me feeling like a asshole. I was doing cardio on the bike with my headphones in zoned out. A group of 2 elderly ladies and 2 eldery gentlemen are biking and chatting next to me I glance over and see they are passing panflets with \"Jesus will save you\" and such back and forth and one elderly gentleman has a vanilla envelope I assume full of them. Whatever right? Not bugging me and they all seemed happy and knew eachother. They walk away and I continue peddling along. After about 5 mins I feel a tap on my shoulder and it is one of the elderly ladies. With a big smile on her face she tries to hand me a panflit, I  shake my head and say \"no thank you\" and face forward again. She then taps me again and motions for me to take my headphones off. I do and say, a little for annoyed, \"yes?\" She then says \"you should take this hun, you look like you need saving\" . I was pretty shocked but responded with \" I dont need anything thing from you maam\" and put my headphone back in. \n\n\nNow i thought that would be it but not 2 mins later she comes back with 2 of the older gentleman. They tap me on the shoulder again and berate me for being rude and not accepting the lords light into me and how I should be ashamed blah blah blah. I dont get to say anything before they walk away. I do however go right to the front desk and ask to speak to a manager.\n\nI explained to her exactly what happened and how it was pretty shocking and if something could be said to them so it doesn't happen again. She then informs her this isnt the first time it has been reported and let's me know she will handle it. I walk out and go back to my bike. She then comes out, gathers the 3 people who spoke to me, old lady included, and kicks them out. \n\nThey actually start pleading and apologizing and looked genuinely upset. I heard them offer to apologize but the manager had none of it. I now feel awful and didnt mean to have them kicked out or worse AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking if someone else's actions were justified or not.\n\nFirst, the scenario is about the author going to the gym and encountering a group of elderly people who are passing out religious pamphlets. The author had previously ignored them, but when approached again, they said no and then went to the manager, resulting in the group being kicked out. The author is now questioning if they're the asshole (AITA) for this.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author was in their own space doing cardio, had headphones on, and didn't want to engage. When approached by the elderly group, they politely refused. The problem arises when the group persisted, approached again, and berated the author for being rude. The author then went to the manager, leading to the group's removal.\n\nFrom a legal and policy standpoint, the manager might have rules against harassment or unsolicited solicitation. If the elderly group was indeed persistently bothering customers, the manager had a duty to enforce those policies. The author reporting the incident could be seen as a responsible action to maintain a comfortable environment for everyone.\n\nHowever, the author might be at fault if they perceived the pamphleting as harassment, even if others wouldn't. The elderly group was trying to share their beliefs, which is their right, but if they crossed into harassment\u2014like persistently following or berating someone\u2014then the manager's intervention is justified. The key here is whether the group's actions were within the gym's policies and societal norms.\n\nThe author's defense is that they were trying to avoid confrontation and maintain peace, but when the group escalated by berating them, reporting it was necessary. The manager already knew about previous reports, so it's not the author's first time bringing this up. The manager's decision to remove them suggests that the gym's policy supports such actions when there's harassment.\n\nOn the flip side, the elderly group might have felt they were only sharing their beliefs and weren't aware they were crossing a line. However, the manager's role is to enforce rules, and if the gym's policy prohibits solicitation or harassment, the manager had to act. The author's actions led to the group being kicked out, but they might not be the one at fault if the gym's policies support their report.\n\nIn conclusion, the author acted within their rights to report the harassment, and the manager followed procedure. The elderly group might have overstepped, so the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
