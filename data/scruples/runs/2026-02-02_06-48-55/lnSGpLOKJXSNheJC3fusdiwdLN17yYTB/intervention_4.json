I usually go in around 6 or 7 and I'm out by 9ish. With the new time change and my fiancee getting a new job it has thrown me off a bit so I have been going to the gym later. \n\nMy gym pretty much consists of the elderly (I'm 25 myself) with a few other gym goers my age. Now I go to the gym alone as I like having some quiet time and it's a good stress reliever for me. I also wanna add that I keep to myself. I dont talk to anyone or bother myself with other people because I just get in my own head. The reason I add this is because many of the older gym goers like to chat and hangout even when I would normally go at 7am. I really dont mind this aa they dont take up any gym equipment and are pleasant as far as I can tell. Now obviously since I'm at the gym a few hours later then I normally go a few people I dont normally see are here but I assume them to be locals but again I dont concern myself with others.\n\n\nSo now to the cause of me feeling like a asshole. I was doing cardio on the bike with my headphones in zoned out. A group of 2 elderly ladies and 2 eldery gentlemen are biking and chatting next to me I glance over and see they are passing panflets with \"Jesus will save you\" and such back and forth and one elderly gentleman has a vanilla envelope I assume full of them. Whatever right? Not bugging me and they all seemed happy and knew eachother. They walk away and I continue peddling along. After about 5 mins I feel a tap on my shoulder and it is one of the elderly ladies. With a big smile on her face she tries to hand me a panflit, I  shake my head and say \"no thank you\" and face forward again. She then taps me again and motions for me to take my headphones off. I do and say, a little for annoyed, \"yes?\" She then says \"you should take this hun, you look like you need saving\" . I was pretty shocked but responded with \" I dont need anything thing from you maam\" and put my headphone back in. \n\n\nNow i thought that would be it but not 2 mins later she comes back with 2 of the older gentleman. They tap me on the shoulder again and berate me for being rude and not accepting the lords light into me and how I should be ashamed blah blah blah. I dont get to say anything before they walk away. I do however go right to the front desk and ask to speak to a manager.\n\nI explained to her exactly what happened and how it was pretty shocking and if something could be said to them so it doesn't happen again. She then informs her this isnt the first time it has been reported and let's me know she will handle it. I walk out and go back to my bike. She then comes out, gathers the 3 people who spoke to me, old lady included, and kicks them out. \n\nThey actually start pleading and apologizing and looked genuinely upset. I heard them offer to apologize but the manager had none of it. I now feel awful and didnt mean to have them kicked out or worse AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by getting a group of elderly people kicked out of the gym for handing out religious pamphlets.\n\nFirst, the author was in the gym doing cardio with headphones on. They were approached by the elderly group who were passing out religious material. The author refused the pamphlet and then later, when the group came back with more insistence, the author went to the manager and had them removed. The author now feels bad and is wondering if they're the asshole.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the author was justified in their actions. The elderly people were handing out religious pamphlets, which can be a sensitive issue. In many places, especially in the US, there's a separation of church and state, so gyms might have policies against proselytizing or solicitation to maintain a neutral environment for all patrons. The manager mentioned that this wasn't the first time such a report was made, indicating there might be existing policies in place.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they were in a public space trying to have a quiet time. The elderly people approached them multiple times, even after being declined, which could be seen as harassment. The author's request to the manager was based on their discomfort and the manager's prior knowledge of similar incidents. The manager then took appropriate action by removing the group, which they might have been required to do under gym policies.\n\nHowever, the author might feel they overreacted because the elderly people didn't seem to be causing a disturbance otherwise. They were friendly and didn't take up equipment. The author's initial refusal was polite, but the group continued to engage, leading to escalation. The key here is whether the gym's policies allow such activities. If the manager acted in accordance with those policies, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for reporting the incident.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the elderly group was within their rights to share religious materials unless the gym specifically prohibits it. If the gym allows such activities unless they cause a disturbance, the author's actions might be seen as excessive. But given that the manager had prior reports and took action, it's likely the gym's policy supports the author's request.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because they adhered to the gym's policies and asked for intervention after being approached repeatedly. The manager made the final decision, which was appropriate based on existing rules. The author's intention was to maintain a comfortable environment, and the outcome was in line with gym management's discretion.\n"
