I usually go in around 6 or 7 and I'm out by 9ish. With the new time change and my fiancee getting a new job it has thrown me off a bit so I have been going to the gym later. \n\nMy gym pretty much consists of the elderly (I'm 25 myself) with a few other gym goers my age. Now I go to the gym alone as I like having some quiet time and it's a good stress reliever for me. I also wanna add that I keep to myself. I dont talk to anyone or bother myself with other people because I just get in my own head. The reason I add this is because many of the older gym goers like to chat and hangout even when I would normally go at 7am. I really dont mind this aa they dont take up any gym equipment and are pleasant as far as I can tell. Now obviously since I'm at the gym a few hours later then I normally go a few people I dont normally see are here but I assume them to be locals but again I dont concern myself with others.\n\n\nSo now to the cause of me feeling like a asshole. I was doing cardio on the bike with my headphones in zoned out. A group of 2 elderly ladies and 2 eldery gentlemen are biking and chatting next to me I glance over and see they are passing panflets with \"Jesus will save you\" and such back and forth and one elderly gentleman has a vanilla envelope I assume full of them. Whatever right? Not bugging me and they all seemed happy and knew eachother. They walk away and I continue peddling along. After about 5 mins I feel a tap on my shoulder and it is one of the elderly ladies. With a big smile on her face she tries to hand me a panflit, I  shake my head and say \"no thank you\" and face forward again. She then taps me again and motions for me to take my headphones off. I do and say, a little for annoyed, \"yes?\" She then says \"you should take this hun, you look like you need saving\" . I was pretty shocked but responded with \" I dont need anything thing from you maam\" and put my headphone back in. \n\n\nNow i thought that would be it but not 2 mins later she comes back with 2 of the older gentleman. They tap me on the shoulder again and berate me for being rude and not accepting the lords light into me and how I should be ashamed blah blah blah. I dont get to say anything before they walk away. I do however go right to the front desk and ask to speak to a manager.\n\nI explained to her exactly what happened and how it was pretty shocking and if something could be said to them so it doesn't happen again. She then informs her this isnt the first time it has been reported and let's me know she will handle it. I walk out and go back to my bike. She then comes out, gathers the 3 people who spoke to me, old lady included, and kicks them out. \n\nThey actually start pleading and apologizing and looked genuinely upset. I heard them offer to apologize but the manager had none of it. I now feel awful and didnt mean to have them kicked out or worse AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for getting a group of elderly people kicked out of the gym after they tried to give religious pamphlets.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author goes to the gym regularly, usually alone for some quiet time. They mention they keep to themselves and don't talk to others. The situation starts when a group of elderly people, who the author notices are passing out religious pamphlets, approach them. The author declines the pamphlet politely, but then the group becomes more insistent, leading the author to approach management. The manager had prior reports and ended up removing them.\n\nNow, the key points here: the author was in their own space, using the gym, and the elderly group was engaging in activity that others found disruptive. The author didn't confront them directly but went to management, who already knew about past incidents. The manager's action was based on previous reports, not just this one incident. \n\nFrom a legal and policy standpoint, many gyms have rules against solicitation or distributing materials without permission. If the manager had prior reports, this group might have been violating gym policies. The author's action was to report a violation they witnessed, which is within their rights. The elderly people were removed because of their actions, not because of the author's request. The author didn't physically remove them; the manager did based on existing policies.\n\nEmotionally, the author felt bad about the outcome, but they acted within the gym's rules. The elderly group was persistent after being refused, which could be seen as harassment or pressure in a public space. The manager's decision to remove them suggests that the gym's policies support the author's report. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They reported a policy violation, which the manager had already addressed before. The responsibility lies with the gym's management for enforcing their rules, not the author for bringing attention to it.\n"
