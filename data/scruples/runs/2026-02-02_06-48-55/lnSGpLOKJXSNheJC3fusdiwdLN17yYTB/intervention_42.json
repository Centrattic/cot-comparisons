I usually go in around 6 or 7 and I'm out by 9ish. With the new time change and my fiancee getting a new job it has thrown me off a bit so I have been going to the gym later. \n\nMy gym pretty much consists of the elderly (I'm 25 myself) with a few other gym goers my age. Now I go to the gym alone as I like having some quiet time and it's a good stress reliever for me. I also wanna add that I keep to myself. I dont talk to anyone or bother myself with other people because I just get in my own head. The reason I add this is because many of the older gym goers like to chat and hangout even when I would normally go at 7am. I really dont mind this aa they dont take up any gym equipment and are pleasant as far as I can tell. Now obviously since I'm at the gym a few hours later then I normally go a few people I dont normally see are here but I assume them to be locals but again I dont concern myself with others.\n\n\nSo now to the cause of me feeling like a asshole. I was doing cardio on the bike with my headphones in zoned out. A group of 2 elderly ladies and 2 eldery gentlemen are biking and chatting next to me I glance over and see they are passing panflets with \"Jesus will save you\" and such back and forth and one elderly gentleman has a vanilla envelope I assume full of them. Whatever right? Not bugging me and they all seemed happy and knew eachother. They walk away and I continue peddling along. After about 5 mins I feel a tap on my shoulder and it is one of the elderly ladies. With a big smile on her face she tries to hand me a panflit, I  shake my head and say \"no thank you\" and face forward again. She then taps me again and motions for me to take my headphones off. I do and say, a little for annoyed, \"yes?\" She then says \"you should take this hun, you look like you need saving\" . I was pretty shocked but responded with \" I dont need anything thing from you maam\" and put my headphone back in. \n\n\nNow i thought that would be it but not 2 mins later she comes back with 2 of the older gentleman. They tap me on the shoulder again and berate me for being rude and not accepting the lords light into me and how I should be ashamed blah blah blah. I dont get to say anything before they walk away. I do however go right to the front desk and ask to speak to a manager.\n\nI explained to her exactly what happened and how it was pretty shocking and if something could be said to them so it doesn't happen again. She then informs her this isnt the first time it has been reported and let's me know she will handle it. I walk out and go back to my bike. She then comes out, gathers the 3 people who spoke to me, old lady included, and kicks them out. \n\nThey actually start pleading and apologizing and looked genuinely upset. I heard them offer to apologize but the manager had none of it. I now feel awful and didnt mean to have them kicked out or worse AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about getting a group of elderly people kicked out of the gym for handing out religious pamphlets.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author goes to the gym late, usually alone and quiet. They encounter a group of elderly people passing out religious flyers. When one lady insists, the author declines and then later reports them to the manager, resulting in their expulsion. The manager says it's not the first time this has happened.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants a second opinion. So, I need to evaluate both sides. \n\nFrom the author's perspective: They were trying to have a quiet workout, didn't want to engage with the religious material, and felt harassed when the group kept approaching. They approached the manager to address the issue, which is a reasonable step. The manager had already been informed before, so maybe this is a recurring problem that the gym is handling.\n\nFrom the elderly group's side: They might be doing what they see as a personal mission, sharing their faith. However, if they're being persistent and disruptive in a public space like a gym, that could be problematic. The employees have a duty to maintain a safe and respectful environment for all patrons. If the gym has policies against solicitation or harassment, the group may be violating those rules.\n\nThe manager's decision to kick them out suggests that the gym's policy supports the author's complaint. The elderly people apologized and seemed upset, but if they're repeatedly causing issues, the gym has to enforce rules. The author didn't confront them directly but went through proper channels, which is appropriate.\n\nHowever, there's a nuance. Religious expression is a right, but it's not absolute. If someone is being forced to listen to religious messages in a public space, especially if it's persistent, that could be considered harassment. The author's actions were within their rights to report the behavior if it's against gym policies.\n\nBut some might argue the author escalated the situation unnecessarily. However, given that the manager had prior complaints, it's a pattern, so the author's action was reasonable. The elderly group's approach might be seen as overstepping, especially when they persisted after being declined.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They handled it through the proper channels and the manager acted on existing issues. The real issue is the elderly group's behavior, not the author's response.\n"
