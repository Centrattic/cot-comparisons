I usually go in around 6 or 7 and I'm out by 9ish. With the new time change and my fiancee getting a new job it has thrown me off a bit so I have been going to the gym later. \n\nMy gym pretty much consists of the elderly (I'm 25 myself) with a few other gym goers my age. Now I go to the gym alone as I like having some quiet time and it's a good stress reliever for me. I also wanna add that I keep to myself. I dont talk to anyone or bother myself with other people because I just get in my own head. The reason I add this is because many of the older gym goers like to chat and hangout even when I would normally go at 7am. I really dont mind this aa they dont take up any gym equipment and are pleasant as far as I can tell. Now obviously since I'm at the gym a few hours later then I normally go a few people I dont normally see are here but I assume them to be locals but again I dont concern myself with others.\n\n\nSo now to the cause of me feeling like a asshole. I was doing cardio on the bike with my headphones in zoned out. A group of 2 elderly ladies and 2 eldery gentlemen are biking and chatting next to me I glance over and see they are passing panflets with \"Jesus will save you\" and such back and forth and one elderly gentleman has a vanilla envelope I assume full of them. Whatever right? Not bugging me and they all seemed happy and knew eachother. They walk away and I continue peddling along. After about 5 mins I feel a tap on my shoulder and it is one of the elderly ladies. With a big smile on her face she tries to hand me a panflit, I  shake my head and say \"no thank you\" and face forward again. She then taps me again and motions for me to take my headphones off. I do and say, a little for annoyed, \"yes?\" She then says \"you should take this hun, you look like you need saving\" . I was pretty shocked but responded with \" I dont need anything thing from you maam\" and put my headphone back in. \n\n\nNow i thought that would be it but not 2 mins later she comes back with 2 of the older gentleman. They tap me on the shoulder again and berate me for being rude and not accepting the lords light into me and how I should be ashamed blah blah blah. I dont get to say anything before they walk away. I do however go right to the front desk and ask to speak to a manager.\n\nI explained to her exactly what happened and how it was pretty shocking and if something could be said to them so it doesn't happen again. She then informs her this isnt the first time it has been reported and let's me know she will handle it. I walk out and go back to my bike. She then comes out, gathers the 3 people who spoke to me, old lady included, and kicks them out. \n\nThey actually start pleading and apologizing and looked genuinely upset. I heard them offer to apologize but the manager had none of it. I now feel awful and didnt mean to have them kicked out or worse AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they went to the gym later than usual and encountered a group of elderly people passing out religious pamphlets. The key points here are about the interaction between the author and the group.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that they like their quiet time at the gym and keep to themselves. When approached by the elderly lady with a pamphlet, the author declines politely, then becomes annoyed when the group returns and confronts them again. They go to the manager, who then kicks the group out.\n\nNow, considering the author's actions: they were approached twice, which might have been more than they wanted. But the group was passing out religious materials, which is generally protected speech in public places. However, the gym is a private space, so the management can set rules about solicitation. The manager already knew about previous reports, so this might be a pattern.\n\nThe author's response was to go to the manager and have them removed. The manager handled it, and the group left after apologizing. The author is now feeling guilty and questioning if they did the wrong thing.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's intent was to stop the harassment they felt. But the group was just sharing their beliefs, even if it was unwelcome. The manager's role is to enforce gym policies, so if there's a rule against solicitation, the author reporting it isn't wrong. However, the author might have overreacted if the group wasn't violating any rules. But the manager's decision suggests there were prior issues, making the group's actions a policy violation.\n\nSo, the author's actions were within their rights to report harassment. They didn't physically confront the group but went through proper channels. The manager's response indicates the gym had policies against such behavior. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
