I usually go in around 6 or 7 and I'm out by 9ish. With the new time change and my fiancee getting a new job it has thrown me off a bit so I have been going to the gym later. \n\nMy gym pretty much consists of the elderly (I'm 25 myself) with a few other gym goers my age. Now I go to the gym alone as I like having some quiet time and it's a good stress reliever for me. I also wanna add that I keep to myself. I dont talk to anyone or bother myself with other people because I just get in my own head. The reason I add this is because many of the older gym goers like to chat and hangout even when I would normally go at 7am. I really dont mind this aa they dont take up any gym equipment and are pleasant as far as I can tell. Now obviously since I'm at the gym a few hours later then I normally go a few people I dont normally see are here but I assume them to be locals but again I dont concern myself with others.\n\n\nSo now to the cause of me feeling like a asshole. I was doing cardio on the bike with my headphones in zoned out. A group of 2 elderly ladies and 2 eldery gentlemen are biking and chatting next to me I glance over and see they are passing panflets with \"Jesus will save you\" and such back and forth and one elderly gentleman has a vanilla envelope I assume full of them. Whatever right? Not bugging me and they all seemed happy and knew eachother. They walk away and I continue peddling along. After about 5 mins I feel a tap on my shoulder and it is one of the elderly ladies. With a big smile on her face she tries to hand me a panflit, I  shake my head and say \"no thank you\" and face forward again. She then taps me again and motions for me to take my headphones off. I do and say, a little for annoyed, \"yes?\" She then says \"you should take this hun, you look like you need saving\" . I was pretty shocked but responded with \" I dont need anything thing from you maam\" and put my headphone back in. \n\n\nNow i thought that would be it but not 2 mins later she comes back with 2 of the older gentleman. They tap me on the shoulder again and berate me for being rude and not accepting the lords light into me and how I should be ashamed blah blah blah. I dont get to say anything before they walk away. I do however go right to the front desk and ask to speak to a manager.\n\nI explained to her exactly what happened and how it was pretty shocking and if something could be said to them so it doesn't happen again. She then informs her this isnt the first time it has been reported and let's me know she will handle it. I walk out and go back to my bike. She then comes out, gathers the 3 people who spoke to me, old lady included, and kicks them out. \n\nThey actually start pleading and apologizing and looked genuinely upset. I heard them offer to apologize but the manager had none of it. I now feel awful and didnt mean to have them kicked out or worse AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting a group of elderly people kicked out of the gym after they approached them with religious pamphlets.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author goes to the gym regularly and likes to have quiet time, especially since they're there for stress relief. The gym has a lot of elderly people, and the author usually doesn't interact with them. However, on this particular day, because of their schedule change, they're at the gym later and encounter these elderly individuals who are passing out religious pamphlets. The author initially ignores the first attempt to give them a pamphlet but then gets approached again, leading to some verbal exchange where the elderly group is confrontational. The author feels upset and reports them to the manager, who then kicks them out. Now the author is questioning if they did the right thing.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the elderly people's actions crossed a line into harassment or if the author's response was justified. Let's break down the key points.\n\n1. **Initial Interaction**: The elderly group was passing out pamphlets. This is generally considered a form of free speech and is protected in many places. However, the context matters. If they were doing this in a public space without being intrusive, it's typically allowed.\n\n2. **Approach and Persistence**: The elderly lady approached the author after the first refusal and then came back with others a second time. The author felt berated and confronted. The key here is whether the approach was respectful or harassing. If someone refuses the first offer and the person persists, it can be seen as harassment, especially if it becomes aggressive or confrontational.\n\n3. **Author's Response**: The author went to the manager, explained the situation, and the manager acted. The manager mentioned this wasn't the first complaint, implying there was a history of issues with these individuals. So, there's a prior pattern of behavior that might have warranted action.\n\n4. **Impact on the Author**: The author was disturbed and wanted to maintain their peace at the gym. The elderly group, on the other hand, seemed genuinely upset when removed, offering apologies. This raises questions about the severity of the situation and whether the author's actions were proportionate.\n\nNow, considering legal and social norms. In terms of legal aspects, soliciting people in public spaces is generally allowed unless it's done in a disruptive manner. If the elderly individuals were in a public area of the gym and not blocking access or being physically aggressive, their actions might be within their rights. However, if they were using a public space in a way that's interfering with others' comfort, the gym management has the authority to intervene, especially if there's a history of complaints.\n\nEthically, the author's right to their own space and peace at the gym is important. The elderly group's right to proselytize is also important, but should be balanced against the rights of others to not be harassed. The line between free speech and harassment can be thin. If the elderly individuals were persistent and confrontational after being refused, that could cross into harassment, especially if they made the author feel targeted or uncomfortable.\n\nThe manager's decision to remove them suggests that the gym sees this as an ongoing issue, which the author reported. The manager might have policies in place regarding respectful behavior and the right to remove individuals who disrupt the environment. If the elderly group had a history of this, the manager's action was within their authority.\n\nHowever, the author's feelings of guilt come from the elderly group's visible distress and apologies. This might indicate that the author's action, while perhaps justified by the gym's policies, was harsh. It's possible that a less disruptive approach, like ignoring them again or politely asking them to stop, might have been considered before reporting them. But given that the manager had prior complaints, the author's action might be seen as a necessary step to protect their own well-being.\n\nIn summary, the author's actions were likely justified given the manager's prior knowledge and the confrontational nature of the interactions. The elderly individuals' persistence after being refused and the manager's history of handling similar complaints support the author's decision. The author isn't in the wrong here because they acted within the gym's policies and their own right to a peaceful environment.\n"
