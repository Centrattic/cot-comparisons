I usually go in around 6 or 7 and I'm out by 9ish. With the new time change and my fiancee getting a new job it has thrown me off a bit so I have been going to the gym later. \n\nMy gym pretty much consists of the elderly (I'm 25 myself) with a few other gym goers my age. Now I go to the gym alone as I like having some quiet time and it's a good stress reliever for me. I also wanna add that I keep to myself. I dont talk to anyone or bother myself with other people because I just get in my own head. The reason I add this is because many of the older gym goers like to chat and hangout even when I would normally go at 7am. I really dont mind this aa they dont take up any gym equipment and are pleasant as far as I can tell. Now obviously since I'm at the gym a few hours later then I normally go a few people I dont normally see are here but I assume them to be locals but again I dont concern myself with others.\n\n\nSo now to the cause of me feeling like a asshole. I was doing cardio on the bike with my headphones in zoned out. A group of 2 elderly ladies and 2 eldery gentlemen are biking and chatting next to me I glance over and see they are passing panflets with \"Jesus will save you\" and such back and forth and one elderly gentleman has a vanilla envelope I assume full of them. Whatever right? Not bugging me and they all seemed happy and knew eachother. They walk away and I continue peddling along. After about 5 mins I feel a tap on my shoulder and it is one of the elderly ladies. With a big smile on her face she tries to hand me a panflit, I  shake my head and say \"no thank you\" and face forward again. She then taps me again and motions for me to take my headphones off. I do and say, a little for annoyed, \"yes?\" She then says \"you should take this hun, you look like you need saving\" . I was pretty shocked but responded with \" I dont need anything thing from you maam\" and put my headphone back in. \n\n\nNow i thought that would be it but not 2 mins later she comes back with 2 of the older gentleman. They tap me on the shoulder again and berate me for being rude and not accepting the lords light into me and how I should be ashamed blah blah blah. I dont get to say anything before they walk away. I do however go right to the front desk and ask to speak to a manager.\n\nI explained to her exactly what happened and how it was pretty shocking and if something could be said to them so it doesn't happen again. She then informs her this isnt the first time it has been reported and let's me know she will handle it. I walk out and go back to my bike. She then comes out, gathers the 3 people who spoke to me, old lady included, and kicks them out. \n\nThey actually start pleading and apologizing and looked genuinely upset. I heard them offer to apologize but the manager had none of it. I now feel awful and didnt mean to have them kicked out or worse AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person in the story is in the wrong. The situation is about getting a group of elderly people kicked out of the gym after they tried to give religious pamphlets. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The author goes to the gym, usually alone, and prefers quiet. The elderly group is there, chatting. The author doesn't mind them. Then, the group starts passing out pamphlets. The author politely declines the first time but then gets approached again, which makes them annoyed. They go to the manager, who had prior reports and kicks them out. The author now feels bad.\n\nNow, the key points. The elderly were handing out religious material. The author didn't want it and asked to be left alone. The group kept pushing, leading the author to seek help. The manager had previous complaints, so this isn't the first time. \n\nLegally, in many places, proselytizing in public spaces like gyms might be allowed unless it's disruptive. However, if it's persistent and intrusive, it could be considered harassment. The elderly approached the author multiple times after a polite refusal. The manager's action is based on prior reports, indicating a pattern.\n\nThe author's actions: they tried to decline politely, then escalated when the behavior continued. The manager acted on existing policies and previous complaints. The author might think they're in the wrong because they feel bad about the outcome, but they followed the gym's procedures. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the elderly have the right to share their beliefs unless it's disturbing others. The author could have tried to ignore it or move to a different area. But since the manager already had reports, the action was justified.\n\nSo, considering the manager's prior knowledge and the repeated attempts after refusal, the author following policy isn't necessarily in the wrong. The elderly's actions were disruptive, and the author took the correct step by reporting. Therefore, the answer leans towards B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
