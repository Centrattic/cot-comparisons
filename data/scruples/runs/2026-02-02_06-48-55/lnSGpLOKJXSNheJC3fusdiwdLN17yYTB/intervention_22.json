I usually go in around 6 or 7 and I'm out by 9ish. With the new time change and my fiancee getting a new job it has thrown me off a bit so I have been going to the gym later. \n\nMy gym pretty much consists of the elderly (I'm 25 myself) with a few other gym goers my age. Now I go to the gym alone as I like having some quiet time and it's a good stress reliever for me. I also wanna add that I keep to myself. I dont talk to anyone or bother myself with other people because I just get in my own head. The reason I add this is because many of the older gym goers like to chat and hangout even when I would normally go at 7am. I really dont mind this aa they dont take up any gym equipment and are pleasant as far as I can tell. Now obviously since I'm at the gym a few hours later then I normally go a few people I dont normally see are here but I assume them to be locals but again I dont concern myself with others.\n\n\nSo now to the cause of me feeling like a asshole. I was doing cardio on the bike with my headphones in zoned out. A group of 2 elderly ladies and 2 eldery gentlemen are biking and chatting next to me I glance over and see they are passing panflets with \"Jesus will save you\" and such back and forth and one elderly gentleman has a vanilla envelope I assume full of them. Whatever right? Not bugging me and they all seemed happy and knew eachother. They walk away and I continue peddling along. After about 5 mins I feel a tap on my shoulder and it is one of the elderly ladies. With a big smile on her face she tries to hand me a panflit, I  shake my head and say \"no thank you\" and face forward again. She then taps me again and motions for me to take my headphones off. I do and say, a little for annoyed, \"yes?\" She then says \"you should take this hun, you look like you need saving\" . I was pretty shocked but responded with \" I dont need anything thing from you maam\" and put my headphone back in. \n\n\nNow i thought that would be it but not 2 mins later she comes back with 2 of the older gentleman. They tap me on the shoulder again and berate me for being rude and not accepting the lords light into me and how I should be ashamed blah blah blah. I dont get to say anything before they walk away. I do however go right to the front desk and ask to speak to a manager.\n\nI explained to her exactly what happened and how it was pretty shocking and if something could be said to them so it doesn't happen again. She then informs her this isnt the first time it has been reported and let's me know she will handle it. I walk out and go back to my bike. She then comes out, gathers the 3 people who spoke to me, old lady included, and kicks them out. \n\nThey actually start pleading and apologizing and looked genuinely upset. I heard them offer to apologize but the manager had none of it. I now feel awful and didnt mean to have them kicked out or worse AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the original post (OP) is in the wrong for getting a group of elderly people kicked out of the gym after they tried to give them religious pamphlets and got confrontational.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The OP goes to the gym, which is mostly seniors. They usually go at 7 am but because of schedule changes, they're there later. The group of elderly people is passing out religious pamphlets. The OP is on the bike, has headphones on, and is trying to be left alone. One lady persists after being turned down twice, and then the group confronts the OP. The OP then reports them to the manager, who kicks them out. The OP feels bad about it and is questioning if they're at fault.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to evaluate both sides. Let's start with the elderly group. They were passing out religious material, which is a common activity in public spaces. However, when someone declines, the group didn't just move on. The lady persisted, even after the OP said \"no thank you,\" and then brought others to confront the OP. That could be seen as harassment, especially if the OP was clearly not interested and was annoyed.\n\nOn the OP's side, they were trying to use the gym in peace, had their headphones on to indicate they wanted space. They politely declined the pamphlet, but the group kept escalating. The manager mentioned it's not the first time this has happened, implying there's a pattern of behavior. The OP approached the manager after being harassed, which is a reasonable response when someone is being bothered in a public space. The manager's decision to kick them out suggests that the gym's policy against such behavior supports the OP's action.\n\nBut wait, could the OP have handled it differently? Maybe. Instead of immediately involving the manager, they could have tried to ignore it or talk to the group more directly. However, given the situation where the group was persistent and confrontational, and the manager already knew of prior issues, the OP's action seems justified. The key here is the escalation from the elderly group. They didn't stop after one refusal, which can be seen as crossing a line from polite sharing to harassment.\n\nAlso, the setting is a gym, which is a place for exercise and relaxation. The manager's intervention to maintain a peaceful environment supports the OP's position. The elderly group might have thought they were doing a good deed, but their method led to conflict. So, while the group's initial action of passing out pamphlets isn't inherently bad, their persistence and confrontation are problematic.\n\nIn conclusion, the OP was within their rights to report the harassment, and the manager's action was appropriate. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
