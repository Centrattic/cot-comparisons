I usually go in around 6 or 7 and I'm out by 9ish. With the new time change and my fiancee getting a new job it has thrown me off a bit so I have been going to the gym later. \n\nMy gym pretty much consists of the elderly (I'm 25 myself) with a few other gym goers my age. Now I go to the gym alone as I like having some quiet time and it's a good stress reliever for me. I also wanna add that I keep to myself. I dont talk to anyone or bother myself with other people because I just get in my own head. The reason I add this is because many of the older gym goers like to chat and hangout even when I would normally go at 7am. I really dont mind this aa they dont take up any gym equipment and are pleasant as far as I can tell. Now obviously since I'm at the gym a few hours later then I normally go a few people I dont normally see are here but I assume them to be locals but again I dont concern myself with others.\n\n\nSo now to the cause of me feeling like a asshole. I was doing cardio on the bike with my headphones in zoned out. A group of 2 elderly ladies and 2 eldery gentlemen are biking and chatting next to me I glance over and see they are passing panflets with \"Jesus will save you\" and such back and forth and one elderly gentleman has a vanilla envelope I assume full of them. Whatever right? Not bugging me and they all seemed happy and knew eachother. They walk away and I continue peddling along. After about 5 mins I feel a tap on my shoulder and it is one of the elderly ladies. With a big smile on her face she tries to hand me a panflit, I  shake my head and say \"no thank you\" and face forward again. She then taps me again and motions for me to take my headphones off. I do and say, a little for annoyed, \"yes?\" She then says \"you should take this hun, you look like you need saving\" . I was pretty shocked but responded with \" I dont need anything thing from you maam\" and put my headphone back in. \n\n\nNow i thought that would be it but not 2 mins later she comes back with 2 of the older gentleman. They tap me on the shoulder again and berate me for being rude and not accepting the lords light into me and how I should be ashamed blah blah blah. I dont get to say anything before they walk away. I do however go right to the front desk and ask to speak to a manager.\n\nI explained to her exactly what happened and how it was pretty shocking and if something could be said to them so it doesn't happen again. She then informs her this isnt the first time it has been reported and let's me know she will handle it. I walk out and go back to my bike. She then comes out, gathers the 3 people who spoke to me, old lady included, and kicks them out. \n\nThey actually start pleading and apologizing and looked genuinely upset. I heard them offer to apologize but the manager had none of it. I now feel awful and didnt mean to have them kicked out or worse AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting a group of elderly people kicked out of the gym after they tried to give religious pamphlets and confront them.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author was at the gym, using a bike with headphones on. A group of elderly people, who were already there, started passing out religious materials. When the author refused, the group persisted, leading the author to report them to management. The manager then kicked them out.\n\nNow, considering the key points. The author didn't engage with the group initially, just declined the pamphlet. Then, when confronted again by the group, they went to the manager. The manager mentioned it wasn't the first time such incidents were reported. The author's main concern is about being rude or overreacting.\n\nLegally and ethically, religious proselytizing in public spaces can be a gray area. However, the gym is a private business, so the management has the right to enforce their own policies regarding harassment or disturbing other patrons. The group's actions escalated when they approached the author again after being refused, which could be seen as persistent and potentially harassing, especially since the author was there to have quiet time.\n\nThe author's actions were in response to being bothered and reported the disturbance to management. The manager's decision to remove them was based on prior reports, indicating that the group's behavior was a recurring issue. The author didn't initiate the confrontation; they sought resolution through proper channels. The elderly group's insistence after refusal might have crossed into harassment, which the author was within their rights to report.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel remorse for causing the elderly to be kicked out, but if the gym's policy is against such disturbances, the management's action was appropriate. The author isn't in the wrong for protecting their space and seeking the manager's intervention, especially when the group's behavior was reported before. The key here is that the author followed the correct procedure and didn't confront the group themselves.\n"
