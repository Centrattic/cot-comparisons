I usually go in around 6 or 7 and I'm out by 9ish. With the new time change and my fiancee getting a new job it has thrown me off a bit so I have been going to the gym later. \n\nMy gym pretty much consists of the elderly (I'm 25 myself) with a few other gym goers my age. Now I go to the gym alone as I like having some quiet time and it's a good stress reliever for me. I also wanna add that I keep to myself. I dont talk to anyone or bother myself with other people because I just get in my own head. The reason I add this is because many of the older gym goers like to chat and hangout even when I would normally go at 7am. I really dont mind this aa they dont take up any gym equipment and are pleasant as far as I can tell. Now obviously since I'm at the gym a few hours later then I normally go a few people I dont normally see are here but I assume them to be locals but again I dont concern myself with others.\n\n\nSo now to the cause of me feeling like a asshole. I was doing cardio on the bike with my headphones in zoned out. A group of 2 elderly ladies and 2 eldery gentlemen are biking and chatting next to me I glance over and see they are passing panflets with \"Jesus will save you\" and such back and forth and one elderly gentleman has a vanilla envelope I assume full of them. Whatever right? Not bugging me and they all seemed happy and knew eachother. They walk away and I continue peddling along. After about 5 mins I feel a tap on my shoulder and it is one of the elderly ladies. With a big smile on her face she tries to hand me a panflit, I  shake my head and say \"no thank you\" and face forward again. She then taps me again and motions for me to take my headphones off. I do and say, a little for annoyed, \"yes?\" She then says \"you should take this hun, you look like you need saving\" . I was pretty shocked but responded with \" I dont need anything thing from you maam\" and put my headphone back in. \n\n\nNow i thought that would be it but not 2 mins later she comes back with 2 of the older gentleman. They tap me on the shoulder again and berate me for being rude and not accepting the lords light into me and how I should be ashamed blah blah blah. I dont get to say anything before they walk away. I do however go right to the front desk and ask to speak to a manager.\n\nI explained to her exactly what happened and how it was pretty shocking and if something could be said to them so it doesn't happen again. She then informs her this isnt the first time it has been reported and let's me know she will handle it. I walk out and go back to my bike. She then comes out, gathers the 3 people who spoke to me, old lady included, and kicks them out. \n\nThey actually start pleading and apologizing and looked genuinely upset. I heard them offer to apologize but the manager had none of it. I now feel awful and didnt mean to have them kicked out or worse AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about someone getting a group of elderly people kicked out of the gym after they tried to give religious pamphlets. The author is 25, goes to the gym regularly, and usually likes the quiet. The group of elderly people were passing out pamphlets, and after being offered one twice, the author tells them no and then reports them to the manager, leading to their removal.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the gym. If the gym has a policy against solicitation, then the author might be justified in reporting them. But if there's no such policy, maybe the author overstepped. The manager said it's not the first time it's been reported, so maybe the gym has existing issues with this behavior.\n\nThe elderly group approached the author multiple times after being declined. The author initially refused politely but then the group kept trying, even after the author was annoyed. The manager had to step in, which suggests that the group's behavior was disruptive. If the gym environment is supposed to be a place for people to exercise in peace, then persistent solicitation could be seen as a disturbance.\n\nHowever, the elderly people might be doing this out of genuine religious conviction, and the author's response was to have them removed, which could be seen as harsh. The manager's role here is to enforce gym rules. If the manager already knew about previous complaints, then acting on the report makes sense. The author might not be in the wrong if they followed the proper procedure by reporting the incident to management instead of confronting them directly.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could have addressed the issue without involving the manager. Maybe a simple request to stop or asking for space would have sufficed. Since the author chose to go through the manager, and if the manager confirmed prior issues, then it's a matter of the gym's policies. The author might be right in following the gym's procedures, but if the gym doesn't have a strict policy against solicitation, the author might have acted unnecessarily.\n\nAnother angle is the elderly people's intention. They might not realize that their actions are intrusive. The author, wanting their own space, reported the group, which led to their removal. It's a balance between personal space and respecting others' religious practices. However, in public spaces like gyms, solicitation is often prohibited to prevent harassment or intrusion.\n\nIn conclusion, if the gym has a clear policy against solicitation and the manager acted accordingly, the author isn't in the wrong. But if the policy isn't clear and the author escalated the situation without prior knowledge, they might be. Considering the manager had prior reports, it seems the gym management was already aware, so the author's action aligns with the gym's policies. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
