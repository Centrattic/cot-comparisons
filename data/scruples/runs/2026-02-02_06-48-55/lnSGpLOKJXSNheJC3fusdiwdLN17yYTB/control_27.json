I usually go in around 6 or 7 and I'm out by 9ish. With the new time change and my fiancee getting a new job it has thrown me off a bit so I have been going to the gym later. \n\nMy gym pretty much consists of the elderly (I'm 25 myself) with a few other gym goers my age. Now I go to the gym alone as I like having some quiet time and it's a good stress reliever for me. I also wanna add that I keep to myself. I dont talk to anyone or bother myself with other people because I just get in my own head. The reason I add this is because many of the older gym goers like to chat and hangout even when I would normally go at 7am. I really dont mind this aa they dont take up any gym equipment and are pleasant as far as I can tell. Now obviously since I'm at the gym a few hours later then I normally go a few people I dont normally see are here but I assume them to be locals but again I dont concern myself with others.\n\n\nSo now to the cause of me feeling like a asshole. I was doing cardio on the bike with my headphones in zoned out. A group of 2 elderly ladies and 2 eldery gentlemen are biking and chatting next to me I glance over and see they are passing panflets with \"Jesus will save you\" and such back and forth and one elderly gentleman has a vanilla envelope I assume full of them. Whatever right? Not bugging me and they all seemed happy and knew eachother. They walk away and I continue peddling along. After about 5 mins I feel a tap on my shoulder and it is one of the elderly ladies. With a big smile on her face she tries to hand me a panflit, I  shake my head and say \"no thank you\" and face forward again. She then taps me again and motions for me to take my headphones off. I do and say, a little for annoyed, \"yes?\" She then says \"you should take this hun, you look like you need saving\" . I was pretty shocked but responded with \" I dont need anything thing from you maam\" and put my headphone back in. \n\n\nNow i thought that would be it but not 2 mins later she comes back with 2 of the older gentleman. They tap me on the shoulder again and berate me for being rude and not accepting the lords light into me and how I should be ashamed blah blah blah. I dont get to say anything before they walk away. I do however go right to the front desk and ask to speak to a manager.\n\nI explained to her exactly what happened and how it was pretty shocking and if something could be said to them so it doesn't happen again. She then informs her this isnt the first time it has been reported and let's me know she will handle it. I walk out and go back to my bike. She then comes out, gathers the 3 people who spoke to me, old lady included, and kicks them out. \n\nThey actually start pleading and apologizing and looked genuinely upset. I heard them offer to apologize but the manager had none of it. I now feel awful and didnt mean to have them kicked out or worse AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's look at this situation. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The scenario involves a gym where the author, who's 25, goes later than usual. They encounter a group of elderly people passing out religious pamphlets. The author declines a pamphlet, and then the group confronts them again, leading the author to report them to the manager, resulting in their removal from the gym.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author was in their own space at the gym, using headphones, and trying to have quiet time. The elderly group was passing out religious materials, which isn't uncommon, but the author felt harassed when approached multiple times. The manager mentioned it wasn't the first complaint, which is important because it suggests a pattern of behavior.\n\nReligious proselytizing in public spaces can be a gray area. While people have the right to share their beliefs, it can become harassment if it's persistent and intrusive. The author was clear in declining the materials and then faced further confrontation. The manager's action indicates that the gym has policies against this behavior.\n\nThe author's actions\u2014reporting the group after being approached multiple times and feeling uncomfortable\u2014seem reasonable. They didn't engage further but sought resolution through the proper channels. The manager handled it, so the author isn't directly responsible for the removal. The elderly group's persistence and the manager's prior knowledge support the author's decision.\n\nOn the other hand, the author did ask for the group to be addressed, which led to their removal. But since the manager had already received previous complaints, it wasn't just the author's report that caused action. The author's intent was to stop the harassment, not to harm anyone.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because they acted within the gym's policies and their own right to privacy and comfort. The elderly group's behavior was the issue, and the manager's intervention was appropriate.\n"
