I usually go in around 6 or 7 and I'm out by 9ish. With the new time change and my fiancee getting a new job it has thrown me off a bit so I have been going to the gym later. \n\nMy gym pretty much consists of the elderly (I'm 25 myself) with a few other gym goers my age. Now I go to the gym alone as I like having some quiet time and it's a good stress reliever for me. I also wanna add that I keep to myself. I dont talk to anyone or bother myself with other people because I just get in my own head. The reason I add this is because many of the older gym goers like to chat and hangout even when I would normally go at 7am. I really dont mind this aa they dont take up any gym equipment and are pleasant as far as I can tell. Now obviously since I'm at the gym a few hours later then I normally go a few people I dont normally see are here but I assume them to be locals but again I dont concern myself with others.\n\n\nSo now to the cause of me feeling like a asshole. I was doing cardio on the bike with my headphones in zoned out. A group of 2 elderly ladies and 2 eldery gentlemen are biking and chatting next to me I glance over and see they are passing panflets with \"Jesus will save you\" and such back and forth and one elderly gentleman has a vanilla envelope I assume full of them. Whatever right? Not bugging me and they all seemed happy and knew eachother. They walk away and I continue peddling along. After about 5 mins I feel a tap on my shoulder and it is one of the elderly ladies. With a big smile on her face she tries to hand me a panflit, I  shake my head and say \"no thank you\" and face forward again. She then taps me again and motions for me to take my headphones off. I do and say, a little for annoyed, \"yes?\" She then says \"you should take this hun, you look like you need saving\" . I was pretty shocked but responded with \" I dont need anything thing from you maam\" and put my headphone back in. \n\n\nNow i thought that would be it but not 2 mins later she comes back with 2 of the older gentleman. They tap me on the shoulder again and berate me for being rude and not accepting the lords light into me and how I should be ashamed blah blah blah. I dont get to say anything before they walk away. I do however go right to the front desk and ask to speak to a manager.\n\nI explained to her exactly what happened and how it was pretty shocking and if something could be said to them so it doesn't happen again. She then informs her this isnt the first time it has been reported and let's me know she will handle it. I walk out and go back to my bike. She then comes out, gathers the 3 people who spoke to me, old lady included, and kicks them out. \n\nThey actually start pleading and apologizing and looked genuinely upset. I heard them offer to apologize but the manager had none of it. I now feel awful and didnt mean to have them kicked out or worse AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted the story is in the wrong. The situation is about the author getting a group of elderly people kicked out of the gym after they tried to give him religious pamphlets and berated him when he refused.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The author was at the gym, which is a place where people go in part to avoid being disturbed, especially if they're there for quiet time. The elderly group was passing out religious materials, which the author found intrusive. When he refused, they continued to confront him, leading him to report them to the manager, who then kicked them out.\n\nNow, from a legal standpoint, in many places, proselytizing in public spaces like gyms is generally allowed unless it's disruptive. However, if the group was being persistent or harassing, that might cross a line. The author was polite when he refused the pamphlet, but the group escalated by confronting him more forcefully. The manager mentioned it wasn't the first time this was reported, which suggests there might be a history of similar issues.\n\nEthically, the question is about personal space and tolerance. The author has the right to be free from unwanted solicitation, especially if it's persistent and intrusive. On the other hand, the elderly people might have felt they were just sharing their beliefs, which is their right unless it's causing harassment. The manager's role is to maintain a safe and respectful environment, so intervening when there's a pattern of behavior that's disturbing others makes sense.\n\nThe author didn't initiate the confrontation; he simply refused the pamphlet. The group then escalated the situation by berating him, which could be considered harassment. By reporting the incident, the author was seeking to address a situation that was making him uncomfortable and potentially violating gym policies on harassment or solicitation. The manager's decision to remove them was likely based on existing policies and prior reports.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions were within his rights. He didn't provoke the situation and was acting to protect his own space and well-being. The elderly group's behavior crossed into harassment territory by continuing to confront him after he refused. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
