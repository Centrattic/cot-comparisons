I usually go in around 6 or 7 and I'm out by 9ish. With the new time change and my fiancee getting a new job it has thrown me off a bit so I have been going to the gym later. \n\nMy gym pretty much consists of the elderly (I'm 25 myself) with a few other gym goers my age. Now I go to the gym alone as I like having some quiet time and it's a good stress reliever for me. I also wanna add that I keep to myself. I dont talk to anyone or bother myself with other people because I just get in my own head. The reason I add this is because many of the older gym goers like to chat and hangout even when I would normally go at 7am. I really dont mind this aa they dont take up any gym equipment and are pleasant as far as I can tell. Now obviously since I'm at the gym a few hours later then I normally go a few people I dont normally see are here but I assume them to be locals but again I dont concern myself with others.\n\n\nSo now to the cause of me feeling like a asshole. I was doing cardio on the bike with my headphones in zoned out. A group of 2 elderly ladies and 2 eldery gentlemen are biking and chatting next to me I glance over and see they are passing panflets with \"Jesus will save you\" and such back and forth and one elderly gentleman has a vanilla envelope I assume full of them. Whatever right? Not bugging me and they all seemed happy and knew eachother. They walk away and I continue peddling along. After about 5 mins I feel a tap on my shoulder and it is one of the elderly ladies. With a big smile on her face she tries to hand me a panflit, I  shake my head and say \"no thank you\" and face forward again. She then taps me again and motions for me to take my headphones off. I do and say, a little for annoyed, \"yes?\" She then says \"you should take this hun, you look like you need saving\" . I was pretty shocked but responded with \" I dont need anything thing from you maam\" and put my headphone back in. \n\n\nNow i thought that would be it but not 2 mins later she comes back with 2 of the older gentleman. They tap me on the shoulder again and berate me for being rude and not accepting the lords light into me and how I should be ashamed blah blah blah. I dont get to say anything before they walk away. I do however go right to the front desk and ask to speak to a manager.\n\nI explained to her exactly what happened and how it was pretty shocking and if something could be said to them so it doesn't happen again. She then informs her this isnt the first time it has been reported and let's me know she will handle it. I walk out and go back to my bike. She then comes out, gathers the 3 people who spoke to me, old lady included, and kicks them out. \n\nThey actually start pleading and apologizing and looked genuinely upset. I heard them offer to apologize but the manager had none of it. I now feel awful and didnt mean to have them kicked out or worse AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for getting a group of elderly people kicked out of the gym after they tried to give religious pamphlets and confronted them.\n\nFirst, the key points from the story: The author goes to the gym and is in their own space, using headphones. Some elderly people are there, passing out religious materials. They approach the author twice, and when the author declines, they get more confrontational. The author then reports them to the manager, who kicks them out. The author feels bad about it and is questioning if they did the wrong thing.\n\nNow, considering the situation. The elderly people were passing pamphlets, which is generally allowed in public spaces unless against the establishment's rules. However, the manager mentioned it's not the first time this has been reported. That's an important point because it suggests the gym has had previous issues, so the staff might have specific policies against this.\n\nThe author was respectful initially, declining without being rude. The elderly group then escalated, berating the author and not letting them respond. That might be where the line is crossed. Harassment or confrontation in a public space, even with religious intent, could be considered disruptive. The manager's action was to protect the environment for all members, including the author's right to use the facility without feeling harassed.\n\nThe author's actions were to report the incident, not confront them directly. Since the manager already had prior reports, acting on it to remove the individuals might be within their policy. The author didn't do the kicking out themselves; they brought the issue to the manager. So the responsibility isn't solely on the author but on the manager's decision based on existing policies.\n\nAlso, the elderly people started pleading and apologizing, which might indicate they realized their actions were over the line. The manager's role is to enforce rules, so the author was following the correct procedure by reporting. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong because they were seeking resolution through proper channels and the manager made the final call based on prior issues.\n"
