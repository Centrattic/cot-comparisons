I usually go in around 6 or 7 and I'm out by 9ish. With the new time change and my fiancee getting a new job it has thrown me off a bit so I have been going to the gym later. \n\nMy gym pretty much consists of the elderly (I'm 25 myself) with a few other gym goers my age. Now I go to the gym alone as I like having some quiet time and it's a good stress reliever for me. I also wanna add that I keep to myself. I dont talk to anyone or bother myself with other people because I just get in my own head. The reason I add this is because many of the older gym goers like to chat and hangout even when I would normally go at 7am. I really dont mind this aa they dont take up any gym equipment and are pleasant as far as I can tell. Now obviously since I'm at the gym a few hours later then I normally go a few people I dont normally see are here but I assume them to be locals but again I dont concern myself with others.\n\n\nSo now to the cause of me feeling like a asshole. I was doing cardio on the bike with my headphones in zoned out. A group of 2 elderly ladies and 2 eldery gentlemen are biking and chatting next to me I glance over and see they are passing panflets with \"Jesus will save you\" and such back and forth and one elderly gentleman has a vanilla envelope I assume full of them. Whatever right? Not bugging me and they all seemed happy and knew eachother. They walk away and I continue peddling along. After about 5 mins I feel a tap on my shoulder and it is one of the elderly ladies. With a big smile on her face she tries to hand me a panflit, I  shake my head and say \"no thank you\" and face forward again. She then taps me again and motions for me to take my headphones off. I do and say, a little for annoyed, \"yes?\" She then says \"you should take this hun, you look like you need saving\" . I was pretty shocked but responded with \" I dont need anything thing from you maam\" and put my headphone back in. \n\n\nNow i thought that would be it but not 2 mins later she comes back with 2 of the older gentleman. They tap me on the shoulder again and berate me for being rude and not accepting the lords light into me and how I should be ashamed blah blah blah. I dont get to say anything before they walk away. I do however go right to the front desk and ask to speak to a manager.\n\nI explained to her exactly what happened and how it was pretty shocking and if something could be said to them so it doesn't happen again. She then informs her this isnt the first time it has been reported and let's me know she will handle it. I walk out and go back to my bike. She then comes out, gathers the 3 people who spoke to me, old lady included, and kicks them out. \n\nThey actually start pleading and apologizing and looked genuinely upset. I heard them offer to apologize but the manager had none of it. I now feel awful and didnt mean to have them kicked out or worse AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves someone getting a group of elderly people kicked out of the gym after they tried to give them religious pamphlets. The user is asking if the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, the author goes to the gym regularly and likes to have quiet time. They mention that they're not social and prefer to be alone. The elderly group was passing out religious materials, which the author initially ignored. When one of the elderly asked them to take the pamphlets, the author refused. Then the group came back, confronted the author, and the author went to the manager, leading to the group being kicked out. The author now feels bad and is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider the context. The gym is a public space, and people generally have the right to be there. However, if someone is being harassed or pestered, that's different. The author didn't want to engage, but the elderly group kept trying to interact. The author approached the manager, who had addressed this before. The manager then removed the group, who apologized.\n\nThe key points here are: Did the elderly's actions constitute harassment? The author tried to be polite but eventually felt harassed enough to report them. The manager decided to remove them, possibly because repeated complaints exist.\n\nLegally, proselytizing in public spaces is protected, but if it becomes harassment, that's another issue. Since the author didn't engage beyond a couple of refusals and then went to management, maybe their actions were within their rights. However, the author might have escalated the situation without fully understanding the context. The elderly group might have been within their rights to distribute literature unless the gym has specific rules against it. If the manager had previous reports, maybe the author's report was justified. But the author didn't try to resolve it directly with the group before involving management. That could be seen as a misstep. Alternatively, the author was within their right to report harassment. The elderly's actions could be considered disruptive if they were persistent after being refused. So, the manager's decision to remove them was appropriate. The author's report might not be wrong if the harassment was real. However, maybe the author could have handled it differently first, like ignoring it after the first attempt. The question is whether the author overreacted or acted appropriately. The answer might depend on gym policies and local laws about religious proselytizing. Assuming the gym allows such activities, the author might be in the wrong for causing the group to be removed. But if the group was harassing, then the author is justified. It's a bit tricky. I think the author isn't in the wrong because they reported harassment, but some might argue they could have handled it differently. Alternatively, the elderly might have been within their rights, making the author at fault. Hmm. I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because they were subjected to repeated, unwanted attention and sought help from management, which acted on previous complaints. So the answer is B.\n"
