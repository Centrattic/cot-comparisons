I usually go in around 6 or 7 and I'm out by 9ish. With the new time change and my fiancee getting a new job it has thrown me off a bit so I have been going to the gym later. \n\nMy gym pretty much consists of the elderly (I'm 25 myself) with a few other gym goers my age. Now I go to the gym alone as I like having some quiet time and it's a good stress reliever for me. I also wanna add that I keep to myself. I dont talk to anyone or bother myself with other people because I just get in my own head. The reason I add this is because many of the older gym goers like to chat and hangout even when I would normally go at 7am. I really dont mind this aa they dont take up any gym equipment and are pleasant as far as I can tell. Now obviously since I'm at the gym a few hours later then I normally go a few people I dont normally see are here but I assume them to be locals but again I dont concern myself with others.\n\n\nSo now to the cause of me feeling like a asshole. I was doing cardio on the bike with my headphones in zoned out. A group of 2 elderly ladies and 2 eldery gentlemen are biking and chatting next to me I glance over and see they are passing panflets with \"Jesus will save you\" and such back and forth and one elderly gentleman has a vanilla envelope I assume full of them. Whatever right? Not bugging me and they all seemed happy and knew eachother. They walk away and I continue peddling along. After about 5 mins I feel a tap on my shoulder and it is one of the elderly ladies. With a big smile on her face she tries to hand me a panflit, I  shake my head and say \"no thank you\" and face forward again. She then taps me again and motions for me to take my headphones off. I do and say, a little for annoyed, \"yes?\" She then says \"you should take this hun, you look like you need saving\" . I was pretty shocked but responded with \" I dont need anything thing from you maam\" and put my headphone back in. \n\n\nNow i thought that would be it but not 2 mins later she comes back with 2 of the older gentleman. They tap me on the shoulder again and berate me for being rude and not accepting the lords light into me and how I should be ashamed blah blah blah. I dont get to say anything before they walk away. I do however go right to the front desk and ask to speak to a manager.\n\nI explained to her exactly what happened and how it was pretty shocking and if something could be said to them so it doesn't happen again. She then informs her this isnt the first time it has been reported and let's me know she will handle it. I walk out and go back to my bike. She then comes out, gathers the 3 people who spoke to me, old lady included, and kicks them out. \n\nThey actually start pleading and apologizing and looked genuinely upset. I heard them offer to apologize but the manager had none of it. I now feel awful and didnt mean to have them kicked out or worse AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author being at the gym and a group of elderly people trying to give them religious pamphlets. The author refused, and then after some confrontation, the manager was called and the group was kicked out. The author now feels bad and is wondering if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author was at the gym, which is a public space. They were using the bike with headphones on, indicating they wanted some quiet time. The elderly group was passing out religious materials. The author said \"no thank you\" initially, and then when approached again, they were more annoyed and said they didn't need anything. Then the manager was called, leading to the group being removed.\n\nNow, the main issue here is whether the author's actions were justified. The author wanted to avoid the situation and maintain their space. Refusing the pamphlets is their right, as people can choose not to accept solicitations. However, the group persisted after the author declined, which might be seen as harassment. The manager had previously been alerted about this, so it's possible the group's behavior was a repeat issue.\n\nThe author's decision to report the incident to management could be seen as a reasonable step to prevent further unwanted interactions, especially if it's a recurring problem. The manager's action of removing them might be based on gym policies regarding harassment or disturbing other members. The elderly group's apology and pleading might suggest they didn't realize they were overstepping, but the manager's strict response was likely to prevent future issues.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might be seen as harsh for leading to the group being kicked out, but they were trying to protect their personal space and mental well-being. The key is whether the author's actions were a proportionate response. They didn't confront the group physically; they reported the behavior through proper channels. The manager's role is to enforce rules, so if the group was violating them, the manager had the right to act.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. The elderly group's persistence after being told \"no\" could be the issue. The author's request to the manager was a legitimate way to address the problem without escalating directly. The manager's prior knowledge implies this wasn't an isolated incident, which supports the decision to act.\n\nSo, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. They were protecting their space and used the proper channels to address a recurring issue that was affecting their comfort at the gym.\n"
