I usually go in around 6 or 7 and I'm out by 9ish. With the new time change and my fiancee getting a new job it has thrown me off a bit so I have been going to the gym later. \n\nMy gym pretty much consists of the elderly (I'm 25 myself) with a few other gym goers my age. Now I go to the gym alone as I like having some quiet time and it's a good stress reliever for me. I also wanna add that I keep to myself. I dont talk to anyone or bother myself with other people because I just get in my own head. The reason I add this is because many of the older gym goers like to chat and hangout even when I would normally go at 7am. I really dont mind this aa they dont take up any gym equipment and are pleasant as far as I can tell. Now obviously since I'm at the gym a few hours later then I normally go a few people I dont normally see are here but I assume them to be locals but again I dont concern myself with others.\n\n\nSo now to the cause of me feeling like a asshole. I was doing cardio on the bike with my headphones in zoned out. A group of 2 elderly ladies and 2 eldery gentlemen are biking and chatting next to me I glance over and see they are passing panflets with \"Jesus will save you\" and such back and forth and one elderly gentleman has a vanilla envelope I assume full of them. Whatever right? Not bugging me and they all seemed happy and knew eachother. They walk away and I continue peddling along. After about 5 mins I feel a tap on my shoulder and it is one of the elderly ladies. With a big smile on her face she tries to hand me a panflit, I  shake my head and say \"no thank you\" and face forward again. She then taps me again and motions for me to take my headphones off. I do and say, a little for annoyed, \"yes?\" She then says \"you should take this hun, you look like you need saving\" . I was pretty shocked but responded with \" I dont need anything thing from you maam\" and put my headphone back in. \n\n\nNow i thought that would be it but not 2 mins later she comes back with 2 of the older gentleman. They tap me on the shoulder again and berate me for being rude and not accepting the lords light into me and how I should be ashamed blah blah blah. I dont get to say anything before they walk away. I do however go right to the front desk and ask to speak to a manager.\n\nI explained to her exactly what happened and how it was pretty shocking and if something could be said to them so it doesn't happen again. She then informs her this isnt the first time it has been reported and let's me know she will handle it. I walk out and go back to my bike. She then comes out, gathers the 3 people who spoke to me, old lady included, and kicks them out. \n\nThey actually start pleading and apologizing and looked genuinely upset. I heard them offer to apologize but the manager had none of it. I now feel awful and didnt mean to have them kicked out or worse AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for getting a group of elderly people kicked out of the gym after they tried to give religious pamphlets and confronted them.\n\nFirst, the key points from the story: The author was at the gym later than usual, encountered a group of elderly people passing out religious materials. They tried to give a pamphlet to the author, who refused. The group then returned with others, reprimanded the author for being rude, and the author reported them to the manager, leading to their expulsion. The author feels bad about it now and is questioning their actions.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author's actions were justified. Let's consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the elderly people were in a public space (the gym) and engaging in religious outreach. While some might find it annoying, unless they are being disruptive, it's generally protected speech. The author declined the pamphlet and was then confronted by the group. The manager had previously been informed about similar incidents, suggesting there was a pattern. The author's request to report the confrontation might have been necessary if the group was indeed being aggressive or violating gym policies.\n\nOn the other hand, the elderly individuals might have been within their rights to distribute literature, unless the gym had a specific rule against it. The confrontation escalated when the author refused the pamphlet, leading the group to approach again and reprimand them. The manager's decision to remove them could be based on policies about harassment or disturbing other members. The author's intent was to stop what they perceived as unwanted interaction, but the outcome led to the group being kicked out, which the author now feels guilty about.\n\nThe author's perspective is that they wanted quiet time and were stressed, leading to a defensive reaction. The elderly group might have been well-meaning but overstepped by persisting and confronting the author after being refused. The manager's intervention suggests that the gym had protocols in place for such situations.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The author might not be in the wrong if the gym's policies allowed for such actions to maintain a respectful environment. However, there's a case to be made that the elderly group was exercising their right to share their beliefs unless they were being aggressive. The manager's role here is crucial as they assessed the situation and acted according to policy.\n\nThe author's initial refusal was polite, but the group's continued interaction might have crossed a line, leading the author to seek help. The manager's decision indicates that the gym prioritizes a non-harassment policy. Therefore, the author's actions were likely in line with maintaining a respectful gym environment, and they might not be in the wrong. However, some might argue that the group had the right to their beliefs unless disruptive.\n\nGiven that the manager had prior reports, the author's report was probably a responsible action. So, the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong.\n"
