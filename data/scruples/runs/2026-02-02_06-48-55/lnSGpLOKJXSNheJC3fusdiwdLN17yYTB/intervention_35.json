I usually go in around 6 or 7 and I'm out by 9ish. With the new time change and my fiancee getting a new job it has thrown me off a bit so I have been going to the gym later. \n\nMy gym pretty much consists of the elderly (I'm 25 myself) with a few other gym goers my age. Now I go to the gym alone as I like having some quiet time and it's a good stress reliever for me. I also wanna add that I keep to myself. I dont talk to anyone or bother myself with other people because I just get in my own head. The reason I add this is because many of the older gym goers like to chat and hangout even when I would normally go at 7am. I really dont mind this aa they dont take up any gym equipment and are pleasant as far as I can tell. Now obviously since I'm at the gym a few hours later then I normally go a few people I dont normally see are here but I assume them to be locals but again I dont concern myself with others.\n\n\nSo now to the cause of me feeling like a asshole. I was doing cardio on the bike with my headphones in zoned out. A group of 2 elderly ladies and 2 eldery gentlemen are biking and chatting next to me I glance over and see they are passing panflets with \"Jesus will save you\" and such back and forth and one elderly gentleman has a vanilla envelope I assume full of them. Whatever right? Not bugging me and they all seemed happy and knew eachother. They walk away and I continue peddling along. After about 5 mins I feel a tap on my shoulder and it is one of the elderly ladies. With a big smile on her face she tries to hand me a panflit, I  shake my head and say \"no thank you\" and face forward again. She then taps me again and motions for me to take my headphones off. I do and say, a little for annoyed, \"yes?\" She then says \"you should take this hun, you look like you need saving\" . I was pretty shocked but responded with \" I dont need anything thing from you maam\" and put my headphone back in. \n\n\nNow i thought that would be it but not 2 mins later she comes back with 2 of the older gentleman. They tap me on the shoulder again and berate me for being rude and not accepting the lords light into me and how I should be ashamed blah blah blah. I dont get to say anything before they walk away. I do however go right to the front desk and ask to speak to a manager.\n\nI explained to her exactly what happened and how it was pretty shocking and if something could be said to them so it doesn't happen again. She then informs her this isnt the first time it has been reported and let's me know she will handle it. I walk out and go back to my bike. She then comes out, gathers the 3 people who spoke to me, old lady included, and kicks them out. \n\nThey actually start pleading and apologizing and looked genuinely upset. I heard them offer to apologize but the manager had none of it. I now feel awful and didnt mean to have them kicked out or worse AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for getting a group of elderly people kicked out of the gym after refusing some religious pamphlets and then being approached again by them.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The user goes to the gym regularly, likes to have quiet time, and has been there later than usual. They encountered a group of older people passing out religious materials. Initially, they ignored them, but when one lady persisted after they said no, the user went to the manager. The manager had already been informed before and ended up kicking them out. The user feels bad about it now.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the group was distributing religious materials, which might be against gym policies. The user was clear in declining the pamphlets and then felt harassed when the group came back with others. The user reported the incident, leading to the group being asked to leave.\n\nIs the user in the wrong? Let's consider. The user tried to be polite, said no, and when the group became confrontational, they took action. The manager already knew about previous issues. The user wasn't aggressive; they just asked to speak to the manager. The group's behavior might have violated gym rules about solicitation or harassment. However, the user's action led to the group being kicked out, which the user now feels bad about because the group seemed upset.\n\nBut from a policy standpoint, if the gym prohibits solicitation, the user didn't do anything wrong by reporting. The user had a right to not be harassed. Even though the people were elderly and maybe well-meaning, if their actions were against the rules, the user's report was appropriate. The user didn't directly kick them out; the manager did after being informed. So the user isn't in the wrong here. They followed proper channels. The answer should be B.\n"
