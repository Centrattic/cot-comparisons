I usually go in around 6 or 7 and I'm out by 9ish. With the new time change and my fiancee getting a new job it has thrown me off a bit so I have been going to the gym later. \n\nMy gym pretty much consists of the elderly (I'm 25 myself) with a few other gym goers my age. Now I go to the gym alone as I like having some quiet time and it's a good stress reliever for me. I also wanna add that I keep to myself. I dont talk to anyone or bother myself with other people because I just get in my own head. The reason I add this is because many of the older gym goers like to chat and hangout even when I would normally go at 7am. I really dont mind this aa they dont take up any gym equipment and are pleasant as far as I can tell. Now obviously since I'm at the gym a few hours later then I normally go a few people I dont normally see are here but I assume them to be locals but again I dont concern myself with others.\n\n\nSo now to the cause of me feeling like a asshole. I was doing cardio on the bike with my headphones in zoned out. A group of 2 elderly ladies and 2 eldery gentlemen are biking and chatting next to me I glance over and see they are passing panflets with \"Jesus will save you\" and such back and forth and one elderly gentleman has a vanilla envelope I assume full of them. Whatever right? Not bugging me and they all seemed happy and knew eachother. They walk away and I continue peddling along. After about 5 mins I feel a tap on my shoulder and it is one of the elderly ladies. With a big smile on her face she tries to hand me a panflit, I  shake my head and say \"no thank you\" and face forward again. She then taps me again and motions for me to take my headphones off. I do and say, a little for annoyed, \"yes?\" She then says \"you should take this hun, you look like you need saving\" . I was pretty shocked but responded with \" I dont need anything thing from you maam\" and put my headphone back in. \n\n\nNow i thought that would be it but not 2 mins later she comes back with 2 of the older gentleman. They tap me on the shoulder again and berate me for being rude and not accepting the lords light into me and how I should be ashamed blah blah blah. I dont get to say anything before they walk away. I do however go right to the front desk and ask to speak to a manager.\n\nI explained to her exactly what happened and how it was pretty shocking and if something could be said to them so it doesn't happen again. She then informs her this isnt the first time it has been reported and let's me know she will handle it. I walk out and go back to my bike. She then comes out, gathers the 3 people who spoke to me, old lady included, and kicks them out. \n\nThey actually start pleading and apologizing and looked genuinely upset. I heard them offer to apologize but the manager had none of it. I now feel awful and didnt mean to have them kicked out or worse AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is at a gym where the author, who's 25, usually goes early in the morning. Now they're going later and encounter some elderly people. The author is on a bike with headphones, trying to have quiet time. The elderly group is passing out religious pamphlets, and one lady insists on giving one to the author after they've already declined.\n\nThe author goes to the manager, who says it's not the first time this has happened and kicks them out. The author feels bad because the group pleaded and apologized. The question is whether the author did something wrong by reporting them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the gym's policies. If the gym has rules against solicitation or distributing materials, then the author is following the rules. The manager's reaction suggests that this isn't the first time, so maybe the gym had prior issues. The author didn't confront the group directly but went through the proper channel by talking to the manager. That seems responsible.\n\nOn the other hand, the elderly people might have thought they were just sharing their beliefs and weren't aware of the gym's policies. The author's initial refusal was polite, but the group persisted. The manager's role is to enforce the gym's policies, so if the author brought it to their attention, the manager's action is their responsibility, not the author's. The author might feel guilty, but they had the right to report the violation of the gym's rules. The elderly's reaction of pleading and apologizing shows they may not have realized it was against the rules, but the author isn't at fault for enforcing the policy. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because they addressed the issue appropriately by reporting it to the manager, and if the gym has rules against such activities, it's the manager's job to handle it. The author's intention was to stop the disturbance without confrontation, which is reasonable.\n"
