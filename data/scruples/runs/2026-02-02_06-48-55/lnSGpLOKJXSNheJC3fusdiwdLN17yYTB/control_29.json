I usually go in around 6 or 7 and I'm out by 9ish. With the new time change and my fiancee getting a new job it has thrown me off a bit so I have been going to the gym later. \n\nMy gym pretty much consists of the elderly (I'm 25 myself) with a few other gym goers my age. Now I go to the gym alone as I like having some quiet time and it's a good stress reliever for me. I also wanna add that I keep to myself. I dont talk to anyone or bother myself with other people because I just get in my own head. The reason I add this is because many of the older gym goers like to chat and hangout even when I would normally go at 7am. I really dont mind this aa they dont take up any gym equipment and are pleasant as far as I can tell. Now obviously since I'm at the gym a few hours later then I normally go a few people I dont normally see are here but I assume them to be locals but again I dont concern myself with others.\n\n\nSo now to the cause of me feeling like a asshole. I was doing cardio on the bike with my headphones in zoned out. A group of 2 elderly ladies and 2 eldery gentlemen are biking and chatting next to me I glance over and see they are passing panflets with \"Jesus will save you\" and such back and forth and one elderly gentleman has a vanilla envelope I assume full of them. Whatever right? Not bugging me and they all seemed happy and knew eachother. They walk away and I continue peddling along. After about 5 mins I feel a tap on my shoulder and it is one of the elderly ladies. With a big smile on her face she tries to hand me a panflit, I  shake my head and say \"no thank you\" and face forward again. She then taps me again and motions for me to take my headphones off. I do and say, a little for annoyed, \"yes?\" She then says \"you should take this hun, you look like you need saving\" . I was pretty shocked but responded with \" I dont need anything thing from you maam\" and put my headphone back in. \n\n\nNow i thought that would be it but not 2 mins later she comes back with 2 of the older gentleman. They tap me on the shoulder again and berate me for being rude and not accepting the lords light into me and how I should be ashamed blah blah blah. I dont get to say anything before they walk away. I do however go right to the front desk and ask to speak to a manager.\n\nI explained to her exactly what happened and how it was pretty shocking and if something could be said to them so it doesn't happen again. She then informs her this isnt the first time it has been reported and let's me know she will handle it. I walk out and go back to my bike. She then comes out, gathers the 3 people who spoke to me, old lady included, and kicks them out. \n\nThey actually start pleading and apologizing and looked genuinely upset. I heard them offer to apologize but the manager had none of it. I now feel awful and didnt mean to have them kicked out or worse AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author was at the gym, doing cardio on a bike with headphones in, trying to be alone. A group of elderly people were there passing out religious pamphlets. The author refused one, and then the group came back with more people and verbally confronted the author about being rude and not accepting their message. The author then went to the manager, who had them kicked out. Now the author is feeling bad and asking if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was in a public space, the gym, which is a place where people go to exercise and maybe socialize, but also to have some quiet time. The elderly individuals were passing out religious materials, which is a form of proselytizing. The author was in a personal space, using equipment, and when approached, they politely declined the pamphlet. However, the group persisted, approaching again with more people and berating the author for being rude. This seems like harassment, even if it's not physical. The manager had previous reports, which suggests this wasn't an isolated incident.\n\nThe author's actions: they were in their right to decline the pamphlet. Harassment in public places, even if it's verbal, can be addressed by management. The manager's decision to kick them out might be based on policies against harassment or disturbing other patrons. The author didn't physically confront them; they reported the issue to management. The elderly people were the ones who continued to approach and berate, which escalated the situation.\n\nBut the author might feel guilty because they didn't expect such a strong reaction. However, the manager's role is to maintain a safe and comfortable environment for all members. If the elderly group was causing disturbances, the manager's action was appropriate. The author acted within their rights to report a problem that was affecting their experience. The elderly group's actions crossed the line from friendly outreach to harassment, especially after the author declined once and they continued aggressively.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They exercised their right to decline, reported a disturbance, and the manager handled it. The real issue is the elderly group's persistence and the manager's duty to enforce rules against harassment. The author isn't at fault here.\n"
