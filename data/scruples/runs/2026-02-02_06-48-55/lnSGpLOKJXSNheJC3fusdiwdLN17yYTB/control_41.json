I usually go in around 6 or 7 and I'm out by 9ish. With the new time change and my fiancee getting a new job it has thrown me off a bit so I have been going to the gym later. \n\nMy gym pretty much consists of the elderly (I'm 25 myself) with a few other gym goers my age. Now I go to the gym alone as I like having some quiet time and it's a good stress reliever for me. I also wanna add that I keep to myself. I dont talk to anyone or bother myself with other people because I just get in my own head. The reason I add this is because many of the older gym goers like to chat and hangout even when I would normally go at 7am. I really dont mind this aa they dont take up any gym equipment and are pleasant as far as I can tell. Now obviously since I'm at the gym a few hours later then I normally go a few people I dont normally see are here but I assume them to be locals but again I dont concern myself with others.\n\n\nSo now to the cause of me feeling like a asshole. I was doing cardio on the bike with my headphones in zoned out. A group of 2 elderly ladies and 2 eldery gentlemen are biking and chatting next to me I glance over and see they are passing panflets with \"Jesus will save you\" and such back and forth and one elderly gentleman has a vanilla envelope I assume full of them. Whatever right? Not bugging me and they all seemed happy and knew eachother. They walk away and I continue peddling along. After about 5 mins I feel a tap on my shoulder and it is one of the elderly ladies. With a big smile on her face she tries to hand me a panflit, I  shake my head and say \"no thank you\" and face forward again. She then taps me again and motions for me to take my headphones off. I do and say, a little for annoyed, \"yes?\" She then says \"you should take this hun, you look like you need saving\" . I was pretty shocked but responded with \" I dont need anything thing from you maam\" and put my headphone back in. \n\n\nNow i thought that would be it but not 2 mins later she comes back with 2 of the older gentleman. They tap me on the shoulder again and berate me for being rude and not accepting the lords light into me and how I should be ashamed blah blah blah. I dont get to say anything before they walk away. I do however go right to the front desk and ask to speak to a manager.\n\nI explained to her exactly what happened and how it was pretty shocking and if something could be said to them so it doesn't happen again. She then informs her this isnt the first time it has been reported and let's me know she will handle it. I walk out and go back to my bike. She then comes out, gathers the 3 people who spoke to me, old lady included, and kicks them out. \n\nThey actually start pleading and apologizing and looked genuinely upset. I heard them offer to apologize but the manager had none of it. I now feel awful and didnt mean to have them kicked out or worse AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for getting a group of elderly gym members kicked out. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author goes to the gym and usually avoids interacting with others, valuing their quiet time. They mention that they've been going later than usual and encountered a group of elderly people who were passing out religious pamphlets. When one of them tried to give a pamphlet, the author declined, and then the group became more insistent, leading the author to report them to the manager, who then kicked them out.\n\nNow, I need to consider the key points here. The gym is a public space, and people have the right to their beliefs, but does that include proselytizing in such an environment? The author was in their own space, using the bike with headphones on, and the elderly group approached them despite being declined once. The manager mentioned this wasn't the first complaint, which suggests there might be a pattern.\n\nReligious outreach in public spaces can be a sensitive topic. While the First Amendment protects freedom of speech in the U.S., private businesses can set their own rules about such activities. If the gym has a policy against solicitation or harassment, then the manager's action would be justified. The author approached the manager with a complaint, which is a reasonable step when they feel harassed.\n\nHowever, the elderly group did seem apologetic after being confronted, which might indicate they didn't realize their actions were crossing a line. The author might feel bad for causing them to be removed, especially since they were genuine in their apologies.\n\nBut the author's actions were a direct response to being harassed. They tried to decline politely, but the group persisted. In a public place like a gym, where people expect to exercise without unwanted interactions, the author's request for the manager to intervene is understandable. The manager's decision to enforce the policy aligns with maintaining a respectful environment for all members.\n\nSo, considering all factors: the author's right to a harassment-free environment, the manager's enforcement of existing policies, and the fact that the elderly group had a history of such behavior, it seems the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
