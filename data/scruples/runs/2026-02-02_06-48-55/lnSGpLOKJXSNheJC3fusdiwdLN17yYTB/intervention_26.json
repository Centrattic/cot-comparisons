I usually go in around 6 or 7 and I'm out by 9ish. With the new time change and my fiancee getting a new job it has thrown me off a bit so I have been going to the gym later. \n\nMy gym pretty much consists of the elderly (I'm 25 myself) with a few other gym goers my age. Now I go to the gym alone as I like having some quiet time and it's a good stress reliever for me. I also wanna add that I keep to myself. I dont talk to anyone or bother myself with other people because I just get in my own head. The reason I add this is because many of the older gym goers like to chat and hangout even when I would normally go at 7am. I really dont mind this aa they dont take up any gym equipment and are pleasant as far as I can tell. Now obviously since I'm at the gym a few hours later then I normally go a few people I dont normally see are here but I assume them to be locals but again I dont concern myself with others.\n\n\nSo now to the cause of me feeling like a asshole. I was doing cardio on the bike with my headphones in zoned out. A group of 2 elderly ladies and 2 eldery gentlemen are biking and chatting next to me I glance over and see they are passing panflets with \"Jesus will save you\" and such back and forth and one elderly gentleman has a vanilla envelope I assume full of them. Whatever right? Not bugging me and they all seemed happy and knew eachother. They walk away and I continue peddling along. After about 5 mins I feel a tap on my shoulder and it is one of the elderly ladies. With a big smile on her face she tries to hand me a panflit, I  shake my head and say \"no thank you\" and face forward again. She then taps me again and motions for me to take my headphones off. I do and say, a little for annoyed, \"yes?\" She then says \"you should take this hun, you look like you need saving\" . I was pretty shocked but responded with \" I dont need anything thing from you maam\" and put my headphone back in. \n\n\nNow i thought that would be it but not 2 mins later she comes back with 2 of the older gentleman. They tap me on the shoulder again and berate me for being rude and not accepting the lords light into me and how I should be ashamed blah blah blah. I dont get to say anything before they walk away. I do however go right to the front desk and ask to speak to a manager.\n\nI explained to her exactly what happened and how it was pretty shocking and if something could be said to them so it doesn't happen again. She then informs her this isnt the first time it has been reported and let's me know she will handle it. I walk out and go back to my bike. She then comes out, gathers the 3 people who spoke to me, old lady included, and kicks them out. \n\nThey actually start pleading and apologizing and looked genuinely upset. I heard them offer to apologize but the manager had none of it. I now feel awful and didnt mean to have them kicked out or worse AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out if the author did something wrong by getting the elderly group kicked out of the gym. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is 25 and goes to a gym that's mostly for older people. They usually go at 6 or 7, but lately, they've been going later because of time changes and their fianc\u00e9e's new job. The gym is mostly quiet, with some elderly people who don't take up equipment and are pleasant. The author likes the quiet and keeps to themselves. \n\nOne day, while on the bike, a group of elderly people (2 ladies, 2 gentlemen) are passing out religious pamphlets. The author is on the bike with headphones on. One lady approaches twice, trying to give a pamphlet. The author declines and asks her to stop. Then, the lady brings two others, and they berate the author for being rude and not accepting their \"Lord's light.\" The author goes to the manager, who says this isn't the first time, and they're kicked out. The author feels bad and is worried about being in the wrong.\n\nSo, the question is: Is the author in the wrong?\n\nFirst, let's consider the author's actions. They were at the gym, trying to do their workout in a quiet space. They were approached multiple times by a group of elderly people with religious pamphlets. When they refused, they were confronted by the group, which was stressful. The author then reported the incident to the manager, who took action. \n\nThe key points here are the right to religious expression versus the right to a harassment-free environment. In public spaces like a gym, individuals can generally express their religious beliefs, as long as they're not being aggressive or disruptive. However, if someone feels harassed or threatened, they have the right to report it. \n\nIn this case, the author was approached more than once after declining, and the group escalated by confronting the author. The manager mentioned it's not the first time this has been reported, implying there were prior complaints. That suggests there might be a pattern of behavior that the gym staff is aware of and needs to address. \n\nThe elderly group might believe they're doing good by sharing their faith, but if their actions cross the line into harassment, especially when someone explicitly declines and they continue, it could be considered inappropriate. The author's response was to seek help from the manager, which is a reasonable step. The manager handled it by removing the group, which indicates that the gym's policy supports addressing such incidents.\n\nHowever, there's a nuance here. The elderly individuals might not have intended to harass, and their actions could be seen as well-meaning but persistent. The author might have felt targeted, but it's possible the group didn't realize the impact of their actions. The manager's decision to remove them suggests that the gym sees this as a valid concern, especially if it's a recurring issue.\n\nOn the other hand, the elderly individuals were in a public space and sharing their beliefs, which is a protected activity in many places. The author's initial approach was to decline politely, but the group didn't stop. The manager's action might have been necessary to maintain a respectful environment for all members.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? I think not. They were in their right to feel uncomfortable and seek help from the manager. The manager's action indicates that the gym supports addressing such behavior if it's persistent. The author didn't confront the group themselves but used the proper channels. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
