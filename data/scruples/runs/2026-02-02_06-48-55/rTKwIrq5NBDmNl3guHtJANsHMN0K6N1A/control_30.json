April Fools! We\u2019re not. Specifically I posted \u201c[Birth Announcement] 2: Electric Boogaloo, Due Fall 2019\u201d. Of course there were some people who took it at face value and liked it and congratulationed us, some were quick to comment with April Fool\u2019s skepticism, others congratulationed us with the caveat \u201cif it\u2019s real\u201d to make sure we knew we didn\u2019t totally fool them in the event it was a joke. Here\u2019s the troublesome part: some folks decided to call me out for extreme insensitivity toward people who have suffered through infertility/miscarriage/stillbirth saying that I shouldn\u2019t joke about things that have brought people so much pain. None of the people leveling these accusations have personally struggled through those circumstances yet friends of mine who have were fine with the joke. I said I\u2019m willing to give any necessary apologies to people who were directly hurt but told the complainers to stop being offended on behalf of hypothetical people and have, so far, refused to admit any wrongdoing or apologize to anyone. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person made a fake pregnancy announcement on April Fools' Day. They used a hashtag with \"Due Fall 2019\" which clearly hints it's a joke, right? But some people took offense, feeling it's insensitive to those dealing with infertility or pregnancy loss.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that some people who actually have experienced those issues were okay with the joke. That's a point in their favor. The joke was on April Fools', which is a day for pranks, so maybe people expected humor. However, even with that context, there's a line between a joke and being insensitive. \n\nThe issue is whether the topic of pregnancy is too sensitive to joke about, especially when it relates to real struggles. The author argues they didn't mean to be offensive and that some people were overreacting. But others felt hurt, which is valid. The author didn't apologize to those who were upset and thought people shouldn't be offended on behalf of others. \n\nBut here's the thing: even if the author didn't intend to hurt, the impact matters. Making light of something as serious as infertility or miscarriage can be hurtful. The fact that some who've experienced it were okay doesn't erase the possibility that others might not be. The author's refusal to apologize or take responsibility could come off as dismissive. \n\nSo, while the context of April Fools' is a factor, the topic itself is sensitive. The author might not have intended harm, but the action still caused distress. The right thing would be acknowledging the potential for harm and apologizing, even if they don't personally see it as wrong. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they didn't consider the impact on others beyond their own intent.\n"
