April Fools! We\u2019re not. Specifically I posted \u201c[Birth Announcement] 2: Electric Boogaloo, Due Fall 2019\u201d. Of course there were some people who took it at face value and liked it and congratulationed us, some were quick to comment with April Fool\u2019s skepticism, others congratulationed us with the caveat \u201cif it\u2019s real\u201d to make sure we knew we didn\u2019t totally fool them in the event it was a joke. Here\u2019s the troublesome part: some folks decided to call me out for extreme insensitivity toward people who have suffered through infertility/miscarriage/stillbirth saying that I shouldn\u2019t joke about things that have brought people so much pain. None of the people leveling these accusations have personally struggled through those circumstances yet friends of mine who have were fine with the joke. I said I\u2019m willing to give any necessary apologies to people who were directly hurt but told the complainers to stop being offended on behalf of hypothetical people and have, so far, refused to admit any wrongdoing or apologize to anyone. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person posted a fake pregnancy announcement on April Fools' Day. The key points here are the intent, the context, and the reactions.\n\nFirst, the intent was clearly a joke since it was April Fools. The author mentioned that some people caught on quickly, others didn't. The problem arises when some people found it insensitive towards those who have experienced infertility or pregnancy loss. \n\nNow, even though it was a prank, the topic of pregnancy can be very sensitive. The author argues that friends who have gone through real struggles were fine with the joke, but others are not. However, the fact that some people felt hurt is significant. The author's response was to apologize only if someone was directly hurt and not to apologize to those who were offended for others. \n\nThe question is whether this was wrong. On one hand, the author had a right to make an April Fools joke. On the other, the topic they chose could be triggering for some. Even if it was a joke, the impact on others matters. The author's refusal to acknowledge wrongdoing despite some people feeling hurt suggests a lack of empathy. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on balancing the intent versus the impact. Even if the joke was meant to be harmless, the subject matter's sensitivity means that the author should have considered the potential hurt it might cause. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not being considerate enough of others' feelings.\n"
