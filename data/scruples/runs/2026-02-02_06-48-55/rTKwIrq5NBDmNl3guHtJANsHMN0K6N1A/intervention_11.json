April Fools! We\u2019re not. Specifically I posted \u201c[Birth Announcement] 2: Electric Boogaloo, Due Fall 2019\u201d. Of course there were some people who took it at face value and liked it and congratulationed us, some were quick to comment with April Fool\u2019s skepticism, others congratulationed us with the caveat \u201cif it\u2019s real\u201d to make sure we knew we didn\u2019t totally fool them in the event it was a joke. Here\u2019s the troublesome part: some folks decided to call me out for extreme insensitivity toward people who have suffered through infertility/miscarriage/stillbirth saying that I shouldn\u2019t joke about things that have brought people so much pain. None of the people leveling these accusations have personally struggled through those circumstances yet friends of mine who have were fine with the joke. I said I\u2019m willing to give any necessary apologies to people who were directly hurt but told the complainers to stop being offended on behalf of hypothetical people and have, so far, refused to admit any wrongdoing or apologize to anyone. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for announcing a fake pregnancy on April Fools' Day. The author posted a joke about a second child, but some people took it seriously and others found it insensitive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. April Fools' Day is a time for jokes, so the author might have thought it was appropriate. However, pregnancy announcements are serious matters, and joking about them can be hurtful, especially to people who have experienced infertility, miscarriage, or stillbirth. The author mentions that some people called him out for insensitivity, and while friends who've faced these issues were okay with the joke, others were not. \n\nThe key points here are intent vs. impact. The author intended it as a joke, but the impact on others is what matters. Even if the joke was meant to be light-hearted, it's possible that it caused distress to some. The author refuses to apologize and tells critics to stop being offended on behalf of others, which might come off as dismissive. \n\nIt's also important to note that not everyone who is hurt by a joke will have direct experience with the issue. People can empathize with others' struggles even if they haven't faced them themselves. So, even if the author's friends who have dealt with infertility were fine with the joke, others might still feel hurt. \n\nIn terms of social norms, joking about sensitive topics can be risky. While the author might not be malicious, the potential for causing pain exists. The fact that some people felt offended suggests that the author should consider their impact. The author's refusal to acknowledge wrongdoing could be seen as not taking the concerns seriously enough. \n\nSo, putting it all together, even though the joke was on April Fools' Day, the topic is sensitive. The author's dismissive response to those who were hurt might mean they are in the wrong. However, since the author is willing to apologize to those directly affected, maybe there's some nuance. But the general stance of not admitting fault could tip the balance.\n"
