April Fools! We\u2019re not. Specifically I posted \u201c[Birth Announcement] 2: Electric Boogaloo, Due Fall 2019\u201d. Of course there were some people who took it at face value and liked it and congratulationed us, some were quick to comment with April Fool\u2019s skepticism, others congratulationed us with the caveat \u201cif it\u2019s real\u201d to make sure we knew we didn\u2019t totally fool them in the event it was a joke. Here\u2019s the troublesome part: some folks decided to call me out for extreme insensitivity toward people who have suffered through infertility/miscarriage/stillbirth saying that I shouldn\u2019t joke about things that have brought people so much pain. None of the people leveling these accusations have personally struggled through those circumstances yet friends of mine who have were fine with the joke. I said I\u2019m willing to give any necessary apologies to people who were directly hurt but told the complainers to stop being offended on behalf of hypothetical people and have, so far, refused to admit any wrongdoing or apologize to anyone. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who made a fake pregnancy announcement on April Fool's Day is in the wrong. The person posted a humorous message, and while some people were in on the joke or skeptical, others were upset, especially those sensitive to infertility or miscarriage issues. The author acknowledges that some people were offended but only wants to apologize if someone was directly hurt. They haven't admitted wrongdoing.\n\nHmm. So first, the context is April Fool's Day, which is a day for pranks and jokes. The author used a common format for a real pregnancy announcement but added \"April Fools!\" and the [Birth Announcement] 2: Electric Boogaloo, Due Fall 2019\" which is a funny twist. However, some people took it seriously and then felt hurt, especially those with experiences of infertility, etc. The author is saying they're not wrong but are willing to apologize to those directly affected. \n\nNow, the question is whether they are in the wrong. The key points here are the intent versus the impact. The author's intention was to make a joke on April Fool's Day. But the impact on others, particularly those who have experienced pain related to the topic, was negative. The author claims that their friends who faced those issues were fine with the joke, but others weren't. \n\nSo, even if it was a joke, using a topic that is sensitive for many people might not be appropriate, even on a day for pranks. While the author included a clear indication it was a joke, the fact that some people were genuinely upset and the author hasn't apologized to them or the critics could be seen as dismissive. The response to the complainers is to not be offended on behalf of hypothetical people, which might come off as not taking their concerns seriously. \n\nI think there's a balance here. April Fool's is for jokes, but the appropriateness of the joke's subject matter matters. Pregnancy announcements are typically joyous and personal, so joking about them could be hurtful. The author might not be entirely wrong if they didn't have malicious intent, but they could be seen as insensitive because they didn't consider the potential impact on those who have experienced related trauma. The fact that they are only offering apologies to those directly hurt, not the critics, might not be enough. \n\nIn some cases, even if it's a joke, it's better to be cautious with topics that can trigger others. So the author could be in the wrong for not anticipating how the joke might affect people and not fully acknowledging the valid concerns raised.\n"
