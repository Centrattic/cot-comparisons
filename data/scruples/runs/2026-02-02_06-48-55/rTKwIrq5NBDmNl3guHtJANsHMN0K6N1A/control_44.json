April Fools! We\u2019re not. Specifically I posted \u201c[Birth Announcement] 2: Electric Boogaloo, Due Fall 2019\u201d. Of course there were some people who took it at face value and liked it and congratulationed us, some were quick to comment with April Fool\u2019s skepticism, others congratulationed us with the caveat \u201cif it\u2019s real\u201d to make sure we knew we didn\u2019t totally fool them in the event it was a joke. Here\u2019s the troublesome part: some folks decided to call me out for extreme insensitivity toward people who have suffered through infertility/miscarriage/stillbirth saying that I shouldn\u2019t joke about things that have brought people so much pain. None of the people leveling these accusations have personally struggled through those circumstances yet friends of mine who have were fine with the joke. I said I\u2019m willing to give any necessary apologies to people who were directly hurt but told the complainers to stop being offended on behalf of hypothetical people and have, so far, refused to admit any wrongdoing or apologize to anyone. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for announcing a fake pregnancy on April Fols' Day. The situation is a bit nuanced.\n\nFirst, the author made a joke on April Fools' Day, which is a common day for pranks. The joke was a fake pregnancy announcement. Some people took it seriously and congratulated them, others were skeptical. But there were also people who accused the author of being insensitive to those dealing with infertility, miscarriage, or stillbirth. The author defends himself by saying that some people who have experienced those issues were okay with the joke. He's offering apologies to those directly hurt but doesn't want to apologize to others who are being offended on behalf of others.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the intent (April Fools' Day), the context (a joke), and the potential harm to a sensitive topic. Even though it's April Fools', pregnancy is a serious topic, and joking about it could hurt people who have gone through real struggles. The author might have not intended to hurt anyone, but the impact is there. The fact that some who have experienced infertility were okay with it is a point in his favor. But others were upset, and the author is not fully apologizing.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, even if it's a joke, he should consider how it affects others. The fact that some people were hurt and the author isn't acknowledging his wrongdoing even if he didn't mean to cause harm could make him at least partially responsible. The response to stop being offended on behalf of hypothetical people might come off as dismissive. Maybe the right answer is that he's in the wrong because he didn't consider the potential harm and is not fully taking responsibility.\n"
