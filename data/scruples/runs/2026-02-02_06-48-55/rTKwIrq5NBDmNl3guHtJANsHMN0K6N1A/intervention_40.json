April Fools! We\u2019re not. Specifically I posted \u201c[Birth Announcement] 2: Electric Boogaloo, Due Fall 2019\u201d. Of course there were some people who took it at face value and liked it and congratulationed us, some were quick to comment with April Fool\u2019s skepticism, others congratulationed us with the caveat \u201cif it\u2019s real\u201d to make sure we knew we didn\u2019t totally fool them in the event it was a joke. Here\u2019s the troublesome part: some folks decided to call me out for extreme insensitivity toward people who have suffered through infertility/miscarriage/stillbirth saying that I shouldn\u2019t joke about things that have brought people so much pain. None of the people leveling these accusations have personally struggled through those circumstances yet friends of mine who have were fine with the joke. I said I\u2019m willing to give any necessary apologies to people who were directly hurt but told the complainers to stop being offended on behalf of hypothetical people and have, so far, refused to admit any wrongdoing or apologize to anyone. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for announcing a fake pregnancy on April Fools' Day.\n\nFirst, the context: the person announced a fake second child on April Fools. Some people took it seriously, others realized it was a joke. But some people found it insensitive towards those with infertility, miscarriage, etc. The author acknowledges that friends who went through those issues were okay with the joke, but others who didn't are upset. The author refuses to apologize and says they only need to apologize to those directly hurt, not those who are offended on behalf of others.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. The possible answers are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to evaluate if the author was wrong. The key points here are intent vs. impact. The author's intent was a joke on April Fools, which is known for pranks. However, the impact caused some people emotional distress. The author claims that those who have experienced infertility were okay with it, but others who haven't are upset. \n\nBut even if some people who have dealt with those issues were fine with it, others took offense. The author's argument is that they should only apologize to those directly affected. However, the issue is that the joke could be triggering or hurtful to others who are dealing with those issues, even if they aren't the ones who made the comment. By making a joke about pregnancy, which is a sensitive topic for some, the author might not have considered the broader impact. \n\nEven though it's April Fools, not all people might be in the right frame of mind to make light of such topics. The fact that some people were upset and brought up the insensitivity suggests that the author didn't account for how their joke could affect others. The author's refusal to apologize to those who felt hurt, even if indirectly, shows a lack of empathy towards people who might be triggered. \n\nOn the other hand, the author did mention being willing to apologize to those directly hurt. But the problem is that the author dismisses the concerns of others who are advocating for people who have experienced infertility, etc. It's possible that the author didn't realize the insensitivity, but the fact that it's a common concern (as seen in similar situations) means that the author should have been more cautious. \n\nIn similar cases, people have been criticized for making jokes about sensitive topics even in the context of a prank. The line here is thin, but the author's joke, while intended as a prank, could have caused pain. The author's stance that they are not wrong because they were on April Fools and some friends were okay with it doesn't negate the fact that others took offense. \n\nSo, even though the author's intention wasn't malicious, the impact on others matters. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider the potential hurt their joke could cause, even if it was a prank.\n"
