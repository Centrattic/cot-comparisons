April Fools! We\u2019re not. Specifically I posted \u201c[Birth Announcement] 2: Electric Boogaloo, Due Fall 2019\u201d. Of course there were some people who took it at face value and liked it and congratulationed us, some were quick to comment with April Fool\u2019s skepticism, others congratulationed us with the caveat \u201cif it\u2019s real\u201d to make sure we knew we didn\u2019t totally fool them in the event it was a joke. Here\u2019s the troublesome part: some folks decided to call me out for extreme insensitivity toward people who have suffered through infertility/miscarriage/stillbirth saying that I shouldn\u2019t joke about things that have brought people so much pain. None of the people leveling these accusations have personally struggled through those circumstances yet friends of mine who have were fine with the joke. I said I\u2019m willing to give any necessary apologies to people who were directly hurt but told the complainers to stop being offended on behalf of hypothetical people and have, so far, refused to admit any wrongdoing or apologize to anyone. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user wants to know if the person who posted a fake pregnancy on April Fools' Day is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: April Fools' Day is a time when people do pranks or jokes. The author posted a fake pregnancy announcement with the April Fools tag, but some people reacted negatively, saying it was insensitive to those who have experienced infertility or pregnancy loss. The author defends by saying that friends who have gone through that were okay with it, and that they're not apologizing unless someone directly hurt by it asks.\n\nNow, considering the possible perspectives. On one hand, the joke was on a holiday meant for humor, and the author included the April Fools note. On the other hand, the topic of pregnancy can be sensitive, and even if it's a joke, it might trigger people with related trauma. The fact that some people were offended, even if others weren't, complicates things.\n\nThe key issue here is whether the joke crossed a line. While the author's intention was to be humorous, the subject matter might not be appropriate for a joke, regardless of the date. Infertility and pregnancy loss are deeply personal and painful experiences. Even if the author didn't mean to cause harm, the impact on others matters. The fact that some found it insensitive suggests that the joke might not have been well-received by everyone, even if others found it funny.\n\nThe author's response is also a factor. They're willing to apologize if someone is directly hurt but dismiss others' feelings as hypothetical. That approach might not address the broader concern that the joke could still hurt people, even if indirectly. The author's stance of not apologizing unless directly asked could be seen as dismissive of those who are affected.\n\nIn conclusion, while the intent was to joke on April Fools' Day, the subject matter's sensitivity might make the author at least partially responsible for the negative reactions. The right answer here isn't straightforward, but considering the potential impact on people's emotional well-being, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
