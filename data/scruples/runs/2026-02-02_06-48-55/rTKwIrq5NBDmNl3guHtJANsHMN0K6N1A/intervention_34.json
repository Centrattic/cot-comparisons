April Fools! We\u2019re not. Specifically I posted \u201c[Birth Announcement] 2: Electric Boogaloo, Due Fall 2019\u201d. Of course there were some people who took it at face value and liked it and congratulationed us, some were quick to comment with April Fool\u2019s skepticism, others congratulationed us with the caveat \u201cif it\u2019s real\u201d to make sure we knew we didn\u2019t totally fool them in the event it was a joke. Here\u2019s the troublesome part: some folks decided to call me out for extreme insensitivity toward people who have suffered through infertility/miscarriage/stillbirth saying that I shouldn\u2019t joke about things that have brought people so much pain. None of the people leveling these accusations have personally struggled through those circumstances yet friends of mine who have were fine with the joke. I said I\u2019m willing to give any necessary apologies to people who were directly hurt but told the complainers to stop being offended on behalf of hypothetical people and have, so far, refused to admit any wrongdoing or apologize to anyone. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person made a fake pregnancy announcement on April Fools' Day. Some people were upset because they thought it was insensitive to those who've experienced infertility or pregnancy loss. The author didn't apologize to the complainers, only offering to apologize to those directly hurt.\n\nHmm. April Fools' jokes are common, but this one involved a sensitive topic. Even if it's a joke, using something like pregnancy loss, which is a real trauma for many, can be hurtful. The author argues that friends who've gone through it were okay with the joke, but others felt targeted. The key here is the potential harm vs. the intent. The author's defense is that it's April Fools', but not everyone will see it the same way. The complainers might not be in the situation, but their reaction is valid because the joke could invalidate real people's pain.\n\nThe author's stance is to not apologize to those who aren't directly affected, which might come off as dismissive. Even if some people found it funny, the fact that it's a sensitive topic means the author should consider the broader impact. So, even with the April Fools' context, making a joke about pregnancy when it's a real struggle for others could be seen as inconsiderate. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not acknowledging the potential harm, regardless of intent.\n"
