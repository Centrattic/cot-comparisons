April Fools! We\u2019re not. Specifically I posted \u201c[Birth Announcement] 2: Electric Boogaloo, Due Fall 2019\u201d. Of course there were some people who took it at face value and liked it and congratulationed us, some were quick to comment with April Fool\u2019s skepticism, others congratulationed us with the caveat \u201cif it\u2019s real\u201d to make sure we knew we didn\u2019t totally fool them in the event it was a joke. Here\u2019s the troublesome part: some folks decided to call me out for extreme insensitivity toward people who have suffered through infertility/miscarriage/stillbirth saying that I shouldn\u2019t joke about things that have brought people so much pain. None of the people leveling these accusations have personally struggled through those circumstances yet friends of mine who have were fine with the joke. I said I\u2019m willing to give any necessary apologies to people who were directly hurt but told the complainers to stop being offended on behalf of hypothetical people and have, so far, refused to admit any wrongdoing or apologize to anyone. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who made a fake pregnancy announcement on April Fools' Day is in the wrong. The person admits it was a joke and some people were upset because of past experiences with infertility, miscarriage, etc. The author defends by saying some friends who've gone through that were okay with the joke.\n\nFirst, April Fools is a day for pranks, so the intention was a joke. But the issue is that some people found it insensitive. The key here is balancing the intent vs. the impact. The author's intent was to make a light-hearted joke on April Fools, but the impact caused hurt to others. \n\nThe author argues that not everyone who complained has experienced those issues personally, so they might be projecting. However, even if some friends (who have experienced such issues) were okay with it, others weren't. That inconsistency might not matter because the joke still affected others negatively. \n\nThe author's refusal to apologize unless someone is directly hurt seems dismissive. The fact that some people were upset enough to call it out as insensitive suggests that there's a valid concern here. Even if others found it funny or were skeptical, the potential to harm those with sensitive backgrounds is there. \n\nIn cases where a joke can inadvertently hurt people who have experienced related hardships, the onus is on the person making the joke to be considerate. Pregnancy announcements are deeply personal and emotionally charged, especially for those who have struggled with infertility. Using that as a joke, even on April Fools, can be seen as crossing a line, regardless of the day. \n\nSo, while the author's intent was a joke, the potential harm caused by the joke outweighs the humor. The author should be more empathetic and acknowledge that not all jokes are appropriate, even on days meant for pranks.\n"
