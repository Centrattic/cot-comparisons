      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for photoshopping a bridesmaid's hair from iridescent blue to natural color in 600 wedding photos. The original post is from the husband, and he's asking if he's a terrible person (AITA) for doing this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of altering someone's appearance without their consent. The bridesmaid chose to have blue hair for the wedding, which is her personal choice. The husband changed it without asking her, which might be seen as a violation of her autonomy. Even though the intention was to make the photos look more \"natural\" and fit the wedding theme, it's still an alteration of her appearance.\n\nHowever, weddings are a big event, and sometimes people have strong opinions about how they want the photos to look. The husband might feel that the blue hair was distracting and wanted the photos to reflect a traditional look. But is that a valid reason to alter someone else's image without permission?\n\nAnother angle is that the bridesmaid's choice of hair color was her own, and the husband's action could be seen as dismissive of her personal expression. This might lead to resentment, especially if the bridesmaid finds out. On the other hand, the husband might have been trying to avoid awkwardness or negative reactions from guests who might not have liked the blue hair.\n\nThe key points here are consent and respect for personal choices. Altering someone's appearance in photos without their consent can be problematic because it's a form of control over their image. Even if the motive is good, the action itself can be disrespectful. The husband may be in the wrong because he didn't ask the bridesmaid first. If he had, he might have had a different outcome, like her agreeing to the change or choosing to keep the blue hair in the photos.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer would lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because he didn't seek permission and altered someone's image without their consent. The act of changing her hair color, even for a perceived benefit, disregards her autonomy in that decision. Therefore, the husband's action, while perhaps understandable in context, is ethically questionable.\n"
