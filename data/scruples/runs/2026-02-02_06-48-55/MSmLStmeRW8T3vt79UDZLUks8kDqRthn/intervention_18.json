      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who photoshopped a bridesmaid's hair color from iridescent blue to a natural color is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author's wife had a bridesmaid who showed up with iridescent blue hair for the wedding. The author then went through over 600 photos to change her hair color to something natural. They're asking if they're in the wrong for doing that.\n\nHmm. Well, I need to consider the ethics here. The bridesmaid chose her hair color, and while it might not fit the wedding's theme, does that give the author the right to alter the photos without permission? On one hand, it's their wedding, so they might have preferences about the appearance in photos. On the other, altering someone's image without their consent could be seen as violating their autonomy.\n\nBut wait, the author is modifying photos they took. They might be the photographer or have the rights to the photos. However, even if they have the technical right to edit the photos, is it respectful to change someone's appearance without their knowledge? The bridesmaid might have wanted to be portrayed as they are, even if it wasn't what the author expected.\n\nAlso, the author mentions it was \"fun\" and uses an eye-rolling emoji, which suggests they found the situation amusing. But the bridesmaid might not appreciate having her choice of appearance altered. It's a question of consent and respect for personal expression. Even if the hair color was unexpected, changing it in photos could be seen as dismissive of the bridesmaid's choice.\n\nAdditionally, the author is using the phrase \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole?), which usually seeks community judgment. The user already thinks the author is in the wrong, so maybe they're looking for validation. But I need to be neutral here.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author altered the bridesmaid's image without consent, which could be a breach of trust and respect. Even if it's their wedding, the bridesmaid has autonomy over her own appearance in photos. Therefore, the answer would be A, yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
