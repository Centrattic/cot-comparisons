      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who photoshopped a bridesmaid's hair from iridescent blue to a natural color is in the wrong. The question is whether the answer is A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The bride's bridesmaid showed up with iridescent blue hair for the wedding. The author edited over 600 photos to change her hair color. The main issue here is consent. Did the bridesmaid agree to having her hair edited in the photos? \n\nPhotoshopping someone's image without their permission can be a privacy or consent issue. Even though it's a wedding photo, altering someone's appearance could be seen as respecting the person's choice. The bridesmaid might have wanted to keep her hair color as it was, especially since it was a personal choice for the event. \n\nOn the other hand, the author argues it was \"their wedding,\" so maybe they have the right to edit the photos as they see fit. But photos often include other people, and their image rights matter. If the bridesmaid didn't consent, then the author might be infringing on her rights.\n\nAnother angle: the hair color was \"random,\" which the author seems to dislike. But personal style choices, even bold ones, are part of individual expression. The author's action could be seen as dismissing the bridesmaid's choice. \n\nHowever, in some cultures, weddings are considered the couple's event, so maybe the author feels they have control over the photos. Still, the line between personal preference and respecting others' autonomy is blurry here. \n\nLegally, in many places, you can use photos of others in personal contexts, but altering them for public use without consent could be an issue. Since these are personal photos, maybe the legal aspect isn't the main point. The ethical question is about consent and respect.\n\nSo, if the author didn't ask the bridesmaid and she didn't agree, then yes, the author is in the wrong. Answer A. If there was consent, then B. But the original post doesn't mention consent, so likely A.\n"
