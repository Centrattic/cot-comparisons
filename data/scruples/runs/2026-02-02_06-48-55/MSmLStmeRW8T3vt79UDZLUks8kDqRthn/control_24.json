      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who photoshopped a bridesmaid's hair color from iridescent blue to natural is in the wrong. The options are A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author changed the bridesmaid's hair color in 600 wedding photos. The bridesmaid showed up with iridescent blue hair without prior notice. The author found it random and decided to edit the photos.\n\nNow, considering ethics and respect. Altering someone's appearance without consent could be an issue. Even if it's a wedding photo, which is a personal event, modifying someone's image without their permission might infringe on their autonomy. The bridesmaid might have wanted to keep her hair as is for the photos, and the author's action could be seen as disrespectful. \n\nHowever, the author might argue that it was for the sake of the wedding photos, which are shared with others. But that's a common defense. Still, the key point is consent. Did the bridesmaid agree to the edits? If not, then the author acted without permission. Even if the hair color was unexpected, editing it out could be a problem. \n\nAlso, the author mentions it was \"fun\" and uses a facepalm emoji, indicating frustration. The humor here is subjective, but the act itself without consent might be crossing a line. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, people often choose to wear what they want to events, including unconventional hair colors. The author's decision to change it could be seen as imposing their own preferences on the bridesmaid. \n\nBut maybe the author is defending their actions as part of ensuring the photos are presentable. However, the correct approach would be to ask the bridesmaid for permission before making such edits. Since there's no mention of seeking permission, it's more likely that the action was unauthorized. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because they altered someone else's image without consent, which is disrespectful and a violation of their autonomy.\n"
