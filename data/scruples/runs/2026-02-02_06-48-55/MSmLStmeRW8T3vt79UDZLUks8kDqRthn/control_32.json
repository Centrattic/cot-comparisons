      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who photoshopped a bridesmaid's hair from iridescent blue to natural color is in the wrong. The question is whether that's acceptable or not.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the context. The person is editing their own wedding photos. They took over 600 pictures, and the bridesmaid showed up with an unexpected iridescent blue hair color. The author changed it to a natural color. \n\nNow, considering the ethics of photo editing. When you take photos for an event like a wedding, there's an expectation that the photos will be edited for the client's satisfaction. Bridesmaids are part of the wedding party, so their appearance in the photos is important to the couple. However, the bridesmaid might have chosen that hair color intentionally. \n\nBut wait, the key point here is consent. Did the author ask the bridesmaid if it's okay to change her hair color? If not, even if the couple wanted the photos to look a certain way, altering someone's appearance without their permission could be problematic. However, in many photo editing contexts, especially for events, photographers often make adjustments to enhance the overall look. But this is a personal project, not a professional one. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is the one who took the photos. They might consider the photos as their creative property. Still, the bridesmaid might have a right to her image. If she showed up with that hair color, she might have intended for it to be included in the photos. Changing it without her knowledge could be seen as respecting the couple's preferences over the individual's choice. \n\nBut then again, in weddings, the couple usually has the final say on how the photos are presented. The author is editing their own wedding photos, so they might have the right to make those adjustments. However, if they shared these edited photos publicly, the bridesmaid might not appreciate the change. \n\nThe main issue here is whether the author overstepped by changing someone else's appearance without asking. In personal photos, people often have the right to edit their own images, but there could be a line when it involves altering someone else's features. However, in the context of wedding photos, it's common to do some retouching. So maybe it's acceptable. \n\nAnother angle: the author uses \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole?), which suggests they're aware that others might think they're wrong. The humor in the post (\"it was fun\") might indicate that they didn't take it seriously. \n\nBut ultimately, the answer depends on whether changing someone's hair color in photos without their consent is considered wrong. In many cases, people do edit photos for their own use, especially in events like weddings where they want the photos to look a certain way. Unless the edits are defamatory or used for malicious purposes, it's usually acceptable. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be in the wrong. They are editing their own wedding photos, and the change was to make the color natural, not something offensive. Unless the bridesmaid had a specific reason for the blue hair, the author's action is within their rights as the photographer and client of the wedding photos.\n"
