      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who photoshopped their wife's bridesmaid's iridescent blue hair to a natural color is in the wrong. The question is presented as an \"Am I the asshole?\" scenario.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The bridesmaid showed up with an unexpected, bright blue hair color for a wedding. The author spent a lot of time editing 600 photos to change the hair color. They mention that it was \"fun,\" so maybe they didn't take it too seriously.\n\nNow, the key points here are consent and intent. Did the bridesmaid know or agree to the hair color change? Since she chose to wear it, but others might find it disruptive. The wedding is a significant event, and the photos are important for the couple and their family. However, altering someone's appearance without their permission could be an issue. \n\nFrom a personal perspective, some might argue that it's the photographer's responsibility to capture the event as is, not to change people's appearances. But in this case, it's the author's own photos, so they might feel ownership. However, the bridesmaid isn't the author, so there might be a privacy or consent issue. \n\nBut on the other hand, the author is editing their own photos. If they didn't have any malicious intent and just wanted to make the photos more consistent with their expectations, maybe it's not entirely wrong. However, changing someone's image without permission could be seen as disrespectful. \n\nThe humor emoji and the \"fun\" comment might indicate that the author found it amusing, which could be seen as lighthearted. But others might see it as meddling. Also, the term \"randomly\" suggests the author disapproves of the hair color choice, which might add to the conflict.\n\nIn AITA forums, people often consider if the action caused harm. If the bridesmaid found out and was upset, that would lean towards the author being in the wrong. But if the author kept the edited photos and the original, maybe not. However, the scenario doesn't mention if the original was deleted or shared. \n\nOverall, the line between personal preference and respecting others' choices is blurred here. The author's action was unauthorized, which could be problematic. However, since it's their own photos and the motivation was practical (to make a wedding album consistent), some might argue it's not the worst thing. But ethically, altering someone's appearance without consent might be seen as wrong. So, likely answer A (the author is in the wrong), but I need to check if the community typically sides more on consent issues.\n"
