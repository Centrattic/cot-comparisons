      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for photoshopping a bridesmaid's hair from iridescent blue to natural color in 600 wedding photos. The key points here are consent, intent, and impact.\n\nFirst, consent. Did the bridesmaid agree to this? It sounds like she showed up with blue hair without prior discussion, so the author might be reacting to something they didn't plan for. But altering someone's appearance without their consent is a big issue. Even if it was unexpected, editing photos without permission could be seen as respectful or not, depending on context.\n\nNext, intent. The author mentions it was \"fun,\" which suggests they didn't have malicious intent. They might be trying to protect the wedding photos from something they found inappropriate or distracting. However, the intent doesn't necessarily absolve the action if it's done without consent.\n\nImpact is important too. The bridesmaid might be upset if she finds out her hair was changed. It could affect their relationship with the author's wife or others. But on the other hand, the author might believe they were preserving the integrity of the wedding photos. \n\nThere's also the aspect of personal choice. The bridesmaid chose to wear iridescent blue, which is her right, but the author might have felt it clashed with the wedding's aesthetic. However, editing photos is a common practice, so it's a bit of a gray area. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, some people might find the action acceptable because the photos are from a personal event, and the author has the right to edit them as they see fit. Others might argue that it's a violation of the bridesmaid's personal expression. \n\nConsidering all these factors, the answer might hinge on whether consent was given. Since the scenario doesn't mention the bridesmaid's reaction or prior discussion, the author acted without consent. But the act itself isn't inherently malicious. So, I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong, but it's a nuanced situation. However, since the answer options are strict, and given the lack of consent, maybe the answer is A. Wait, but in many cases, people edit photos without consent, especially in personal events. So maybe B is more appropriate here. Hmm.\n"
