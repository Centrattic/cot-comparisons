      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author photoshopped one of their wife's bridesmaids' hair from iridescent blue to a natural color in over 600 wedding pictures. The author is asking if they're the asshole for doing that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The bridesmaid chose to have blue hair, which is her personal choice. The author, without consulting her, altered her appearance in the photos. That could be seen as violating the bridesmaid's autonomy. People might argue that it's the author's photos, so they can edit them as they want. But others might say it's about respecting someone else's image, especially in a significant event like a wedding.\n\nThen there's the aspect of consent. The author didn't ask the bridesmaid if it's okay to change her hair color. Even though it's the author's photos, the subjects have some rights over how they're portrayed. The fact that the author found it \"fun\" might downplay the potential harm to the bridesmaid's feelings. The humor in the post could be a defense mechanism, but it might also be seen as dismissive of the bridesmaid's choice.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might be trying to maintain the wedding photos as they were intended, maybe to preserve a certain aesthetic or to avoid the iridescent blue hair sticking out. But the key issue is the lack of communication. If the author had asked the bridesmaid first, maybe they could have reached a mutual agreement. Without that, it's an assumption that the author's preference is more important.\n\nI also need to think about societal norms. People often wear bold hair colors to weddings, especially if it's part of their personal style. The author's reaction might be seen as being overly controlling or not respecting the bridesmaid's self-expression. The fact that there were 600 photos does add a layer of effort and time, but that doesn't justify editing someone else's image without consent.\n\nIn summary, the main points are consent, respect for personal choices, and the right to control one's own image. The author didn't seek permission, which could lead to the bridesmaid feeling disrespected. Even if the author's intention was to preserve the wedding's aesthetic, the method used was without consent. So, the answer is more likely that the author is in the wrong.\n"
