      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who photoshopped a bridesmaid's hair from iridescent blue to natural color is in the wrong. They used over 600 pictures and it was for their wedding. The original post is on AITA (Am I the Asshole?), so we need to consider the context.\n\nFirst, the author is a groom or someone in the wedding party. The bridesmaid showed up with blue hair, which the author finds unexpected. They altered the photos to make it a natural color. The question is whether this is a wrongdoing.\n\nPossible angles: Privacy and consent. The bridesmaid might not have wanted her hair edited without permission. Even though it's the author's wedding, altering someone's appearance in photos can be a sensitive issue. On the other hand, the author might argue it was to maintain a traditional look for the wedding photos, which are their own to edit.\n\nSome might say it's respecting the couple's preferences, others might see it as violating the bridesmaid's personal choice. The key points are consent and the reason for the edit. Since the author didn't ask the bridesmaid, that could be a problem. However, in a wedding context, there's often some flexibility in photo editing. The humor in the original post (\"it was fun\") might suggest it was a lighthearted fix rather than malicious intent.\n\nBut in terms of right or wrong, without consent, it's a gray area. However, in many cases, people expect some editing in professional photos, especially for events like weddings. Still, if the bridesmaid felt disrespected, the author could be seen as wrong. However, the user's perspective is that they were correcting something they found inappropriate for the event. The answer might lean towards not in the wrong (B) because it's their photos and wedding, but it's a close call.\n"
