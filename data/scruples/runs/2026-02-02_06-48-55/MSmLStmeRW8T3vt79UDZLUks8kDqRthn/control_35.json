      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who Photoshop'd a bridesmaid's hair from iridescent blue to natural color is in the wrong. The situation is about a wedding with over 600 photos, and the author found it \"fun\" to edit the hair color. The question is asking to determine if the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The key points are consent and the context. The author didn't get permission from the bridesmaid to alter her appearance in the photos. Even though it was their wedding, editing someone's image without their consent can be problematic. The bridesmaid chose to wear iridescent blue hair, which was her personal choice. By changing it to natural, the author is altering how she presented herself, which might not be appreciated.\n\nHowever, some might argue that since it's the author's wedding, they have some rights over the photos they took. But even so, the bridesmaid has a right to her image, especially if she hadn't agreed to the edits. The author's action could be seen as a violation of her autonomy. The fact that they found it \"fun\" might trivialize the other person's feelings. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author's intention was to make the wedding photos look more cohesive or to avoid an unexpected color that clashed. But that's not an excuse for not seeking consent. The number of photos (600) suggests a significant effort to alter someone's image without asking, which could be seen as disrespectful. \n\nThere's also the aspect of personal expression. The bridesmaid's choice of hair color was a form of self-expression, and changing it without permission could be considered an infringement on her rights. Even if the author thought it was random, they still have a responsibility to respect others' personal choices in such a public and personal event.\n\nIn terms of social norms, while people might joke about this, from an ethical standpoint, consent is crucial. Without consent, altering someone's image in photos, especially in a professional or semi-professional context like a wedding, can be problematic. The author might not be in the wrong in terms of legal standing, but ethically, they did something that could be considered disrespectful.\n\nSo, putting this all together, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong because they altered someone else's appearance without consent, which is a breach of respect for the individual's autonomy and personal choices.\n"
