      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who photoshopped a bridesmaid's hair color from iridescent blue to a natural color is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author changed the hair color without the bridesmaid's consent. Even though the original color was unexpected, altering someone's appearance in photos without their permission can be an issue. It's about autonomy and control over one's image.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that the blue hair was random and they wanted a more traditional wedding photo. But that doesn't justify editing someone else's features without asking. It's a privacy and respect matter. The bridesmaid might have wanted to stand out intentionally, and the author's actions could be seen as disregarding that choice.\n\nAlso, there are over 600 photos. Even if the editor did it for good reasons, the scale is significant. Without consent, it's a problem. So, the answer would be A\u2014yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
