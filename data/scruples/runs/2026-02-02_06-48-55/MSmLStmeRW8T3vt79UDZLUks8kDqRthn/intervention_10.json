      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who photoshopped a bridesmaid's hair color from iridescent blue to a natural color is in the wrong. The situation is that the bridesmaid showed up with random blue hair for the wedding, and the author edited over 600 pictures.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of altering someone's appearance in photos without their consent. The author's intention was to make the hair a natural color, maybe to fit the wedding theme or personal preferences. But did they have the right to do that without asking the bridesmaid?\n\nPhotoshopping someone's image can be seen as a form of altering their personal image, which might be a privacy issue. Even if it's a friend, changing their appearance in photos they didn't agree to can be problematic. The bridesmaid might have wanted to show off her choice of hair color, and editing it without permission could be a breach of trust.\n\nAlso, the fact that there are over 600 pictures makes it more significant. It's not just one photo; it's a large number, which could affect how the bridesmaid feels about the event. Even if the author thought it was a joke or fun, others might see it as disrespectful.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that since it's a personal event, the photographer (or someone taking photos) has the right to edit the photos. But usually, the photographer would have a responsibility to capture the event as it is unless there's a prior agreement to edit. The author didn't mention consulting the bridesmaid first, so that's a point against them.\n\nIn terms of consent, the key issue here is whether the author had the right to make that change. Without consent, altering someone's appearance in photos can be considered a violation. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the bridesmaid's choice and autonomy over her own image.\n"
