      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who photoshopped a bridesmaid's hair color from iridescent blue to a natural color is in the wrong. The original post is from a groom, probably, who took over 600 photos and thought it was fun to edit the hair color.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The bridesmaid chose to show up with an unusual hair color, which might be her personal choice. The groom edited the photos without her permission. Even though the blue hair was unexpected, does that give him the right to alter her appearance in the photos?\n\nOwnership of the photos is a factor. If he took the photos, he might own them, but the subjects have rights to their image. Editing someone's appearance without consent could be seen as violating that right. Bridesmaids might expect their photos to be shared as they appeared, unless they agreed otherwise. \n\nAlso, the groom's intention matters. He said it was \"fun,\" but others might find it disrespectful. The bride might be upset if she wasn't consulted. The groom's actions could affect the bridesmaid's feelings, even if the groom didn't mean any harm. \n\nIn terms of etiquette, changing someone's image without their knowledge might be considered wrong, even if the original choice was unexpected. People have the right to their own image, and altering it without permission can be a breach of trust. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be A, the author is in the wrong. The key points are lack of consent, the right to one's image, and potential disrespect towards the bridesmaid's choice.\n"
