      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for photoshopping a bridesmaid's hair color from iridescent blue to natural.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author changed the hair color in 600 photos. The bridesmaid showed up with blue hair, which the author found random. He edited it to natural. The question is whether he's wrong for doing that without permission.\n\nSo, from a rights perspective, the bridesmaid might be upset about her appearance being altered without consent. Editing photos, especially in a large number, could be seen as violating her right to how her image is presented. Even if it's a wedding photo, the subject has some rights. However, it's a personal event, so maybe there's an expectation that photos can be edited for the couple's album. But the key issue is consent. Did he ask her first? If he didn't, it's a problem. Also, the use of humor (\"it was fun\") might trivialize the situation. On the other hand, some might argue that the couple has the right to edit their own wedding photos. But if the bridesmaid later objects, the author could face backlash. So, the answer hinges on whether altering someone's appearance without consent is considered wrong. I think the answer is A because the author didn't ask and changed the person's appearance, which could be seen as respecting her autonomy. So, he's in the wrong.\n"
