      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the person who photoshopped a bridesmaid's hair from iridescent blue to natural color is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user is a husband who took over 600 wedding photos. A bridesmaid showed up with iridescent blue hair, which the husband found random. He then edited all the photos to change her hair color. The key points here are consent and the reason for the edit.\n\nOn one hand, the bridesmaid chose her own hair color for the wedding. Editing it without her permission could be seen as altering someone else's appearance without their say-so. Even if it's a wedding photo, the bridesmaid might have wanted to keep her hair as it was. The husband might have done it to make the photos look more traditional or because he didn't like the color, but that's his preference. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband might argue that the iridescent blue was unexpected and perhaps clashed with the wedding theme. He might feel that the photos should reflect a more natural look, especially for a wedding album. However, editing someone's appearance without their consent can be problematic. The bridesmaid might not be happy if she finds out, feeling her choice was disrespected.\n\nAlso, the act of editing 600 photos is a lot of work. While it shows dedication to the project, it doesn't necessarily justify the lack of consent. The main issue here is about respecting others' autonomy in their own appearance, even in photos. \n\nI think the key here is consent. Without the bridesmaid's permission, the husband made a decision that affects her image. Even if the intention was to make the photos look better, it's still an alteration without her input. So, the husband might be in the wrong because he didn't ask and went ahead with a change that could be seen as altering someone else's personal choice.\n"
