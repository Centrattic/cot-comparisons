      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who photoshopped a bridesmaid's hair from iridescent blue to a natural color is in the wrong. The question is whether that's AITA (Am I the Asshole).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author changed the hair color of a bridesmaid without permission. The bridesmaid chose to wear iridescent blue hair for the wedding. The author did this in over 600 photos, which seems like a lot. The reason given is that the blue hair was unexpected and they found it \"random.\"\n\nNow, thinking about ethics and respect. Altering someone's appearance in photos without their consent could be an issue. Even if the author thought the blue hair was inappropriate for the wedding, they didn't have the right to change it. The bridesmaid has a right to how her image is presented, especially in official wedding photos. The act of editing without permission could be seen as disrespectful, regardless of the reason.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author was trying to maintain the aesthetic of the wedding photos. However, that's not a valid excuse for altering someone's image without consent. The key point here is the lack of consent. The bridesmaid probably didn't expect her hair color to be altered, which could lead to embarrassment or upset.\n\nAlso, the author mentions it was \"fun,\" which might come off as dismissive of the bridesmaid's feelings. The humor or personal satisfaction from editing 600 photos doesn't justify the action. Respect for others' choices and autonomy is important, even if the choices seem strange to others.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is in the wrong because they altered someone's image without consent, which is a breach of personal boundaries and could be considered unethical.\n"
