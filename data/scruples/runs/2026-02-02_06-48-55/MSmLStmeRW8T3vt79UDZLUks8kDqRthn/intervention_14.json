      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who photoshopped a bridesmaid's hair color from iridescent blue to natural is in the wrong. The author says it was over 600 pics and they found it \"fun.\" The person is asking if they are at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The bridesmaid chose to wear iridescent blue hair for the wedding. The author altered the photos without permission. The key points here are consent and intent. Did the author have the right to edit someone else's appearance without their approval? Even though it was for a wedding, the bridesmaid's choice of hair color was her own. \n\nPhotoshopping someone's image without their consent could be seen as a violation of their autonomy. Even if the author thought it was for the better, changing someone's appearance in photos without asking might be considered disrespectful or overstepping. The fact that there were 600 pictures makes it more significant, as it's not just a one-time edit but a large-scale alteration.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author owns the photos since they were the ones who took them, so they have the right to edit them. However, the bridesmaid might have expected to be portrayed as she appeared on the day, so altering that could be problematic. It's a question of respect for personal choices versus creative control over the photos.\n\nI think the answer hinges on consent. Without the bridesmaid's permission, altering her hair color in all those photos could be seen as disrespectful. The author's reasoning about \"fun\" might not justify the action, especially if it disregards the other person's autonomy. So, I would lean towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
