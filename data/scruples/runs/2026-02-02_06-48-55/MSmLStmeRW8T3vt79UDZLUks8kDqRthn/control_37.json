      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the person is in the wrong. The user is asking about a situation where someone photoshopped a bridesmaid's hair from iridescent blue to a natural color. The original post mentions that the bridesmaid showed up \"randomly\" with that hair color for the wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of altering someone's image without their consent. Photoshopping someone's appearance, even in photos, can be a touchy subject. The person argues that they had over 600 pictures and it was fun, but the key issue here is whether changing the bride's hair color was respectful.\n\nThe bridesmaid chose to wear iridescent blue hair, which might have been her personal style or a fashion choice. By changing it, the photographer (assuming the author is the photographer) is altering the person's self-expression. Even if it was done for the sake of the wedding photos, it's about consent. The bridesmaid might not have wanted her hair color changed, and the author didn't ask permission.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that in professional photography, there's a duty to present the best possible images, and maybe adjusting colors could be part of that. But the color was a personal choice, so changing it without consent could be seen as disrespectful. The author's frustration is evident with the emoji, but that doesn't justify the action.\n\nSo, the main points are consent and respect for personal choices. If the author didn't ask and went ahead to alter the photo, that's crossing a line. Hence, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
