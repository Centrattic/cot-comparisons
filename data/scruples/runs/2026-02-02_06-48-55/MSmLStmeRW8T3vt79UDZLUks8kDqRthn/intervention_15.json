      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who photoshopped a bridesmaid's hair color from blue to natural is in the wrong. The question is AITA (Am I the Asshole) style.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author didn't like the bridesmaid's blue hair at the wedding and edited over 600 photos. They think it might be wrong. The user says they think the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nI need to decide if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). Let me break it down. The key factors here are consent, respect for the person's choice, and the context of the wedding photos.\n\nThe bridesmaid chose to wear blue hair, which the author found random. But people have the right to express themselves however they want, especially in a personal event like a wedding. By editing the hair color without permission, the author is altering someone else's appearance in photos that they might have shared publicly. This could be seen as a violation of the bridesmaid's autonomy. Even if the author owns the photos (if they're the photographer or the one who took them), changing someone's features without their consent could be problematic. \n\nHowever, some might argue that it's the author's photos and they can edit them as they please. But the bride's wedding is a shared event, so sharing edited photos of others might affect the bridesmaid's experience. The author might have a good intention (wanting to preserve natural hair color), but respecting the person's choice is important. The act of doing it to 600 photos seems excessive and possibly disrespectful, even if done in a humorous way with the facepalm emoji. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is whether the action harmed someone else or disrespected their choice. Here, the bridesmaid might feel her choice was not respected, even if the photos are the author's. So, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong). The author crossed a line by not respecting the bridesmaid's decision to have blue hair, even if it was unexpected.\n"
