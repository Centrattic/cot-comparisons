      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who Photoshop'd a bridesmaid's hair color from blue to natural is in the wrong. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the person is asking if they're the \"a**hole\" (AITA) for changing a bridesmaid's hair color in 600+ wedding photos. The bridesmaid showed up with iridescent blue hair, which the author found random. They edited it to a natural color because they found it too much.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my opinion. I need to decide between A (Yes, in the wrong) or B (No).\n\nHmm. Let's consider the ethics here. The author is altering someone else's appearance in personal photos. Even if it's their wedding, the bridesmaid has the right to how they present themselves. The author might not have asked for permission, which is a problem. Editing someone's hair color without their consent could be seen as disrespectful. The bride's side might have their own opinions, but the groom editing a bridesmaid's photos without permission could be crossing a line. Also, the fact that it was over 600 pictures makes it more significant, as it's a lot of edits. The reason given is that the color was \"random,\" but that's subjective. The bridesmaid chose their hair, so the author shouldn't impose their preference. It's possible the author thought they were helping for the wedding photos, but without asking, it's meddling. So, probably A. But maybe some people would say it's their photos to edit. But the key issue is consent. So I think the answer is A.\n"
