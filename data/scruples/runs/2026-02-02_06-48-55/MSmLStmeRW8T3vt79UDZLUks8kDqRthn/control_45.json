      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who photoshopped a bridesmaid's hair from iridescent blue to natural color is in the wrong. The original question is from a Reddit-style \"Am I the Asshole\" scenario.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author changed the hair color in over 600 wedding photos. The bride's bridesmaid showed up with an unexpected iridescent blue hair, which the author found random for a wedding. The author then edited the photos to make it natural. The question is whether this action is wrong.\n\nI should think about consent and privacy. The author is altering someone else's appearance without their permission. Even if they are a bridesmaid, it's their personal choice to have that hair color. Editing it without asking could be seen as disrespectful. However, there's also the argument that these are photos of a wedding, which the author might be curating for their own memories and sharing. \n\nBut photoshopping someone's appearance in photos can be a privacy issue. If the bridesmaid didn't want her hair to be changed, then the author overstepped. On the other hand, if the author is only editing photos they are sharing publicly, maybe there's a difference if the altered photos aren't used maliciously. \n\nThe tone of the original post includes an emoji that shows frustration, but the author seems to be annoyed at the bride's choice. That might influence whether others see it as a justified edit. However, the key point is the lack of consent. Even if the author didn't mean to harm, changing someone's appearance without permission could be seen as wrong. \n\nI need to check if there are any legal aspects, but in a social context, it's about respect. The answer would likely depend on whether the author had the right to alter someone else's image in photos. Since the photos are of a shared event, but the individuals have the right to their own image, the author might be in the wrong. \n\nSo, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they altered someone's appearance without consent, which can be seen as a violation of their autonomy.\n"
