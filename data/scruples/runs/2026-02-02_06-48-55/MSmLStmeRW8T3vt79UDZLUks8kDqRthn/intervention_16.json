      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who photoshopped a bridesmaid's hair color from iridescent blue to natural is in the wrong. The original post is on AITA (Am I the Asshole), so the context is that they're seeking opinions on if their actions were wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The person changed the hair color of a bridesmaid without permission. The bridesmaid chose to wear iridescent blue hair, which is a personal choice. The author did this after the event, over 600 photos, which took time and effort. They mention it was \"fun,\" so maybe they see it as harmless editing.\n\nBut the key points here are consent and respect. The bridesmaid's choice of hair color, even if it's unexpected, is her personal expression. Altering it without her permission could be seen as disrespectful. The author is essentially changing how someone else looks in photos taken for a public event, which others might view as crossing a boundary. Even if the author thinks it's a good idea, it's about respecting others' autonomy. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that the photos are their own and they can edit them as they like. However, the photos include other people, so there's a consideration of their feelings and privacy. If the bridesmaid found out and was upset, that would support the idea that the author was wrong. But without knowing the reaction, it's about the principle. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers intention and impact. The author's intention was to make the photos look more \"natural,\" but the impact is altering someone else's appearance without their consent. That's a gray area, but the act of editing someone else's image without asking could be seen as disrespectful. So, the answer might lean towards A (they are in the wrong). However, some might say that since it's their own photos, they have the right to edit them. \n\nBut the key here is that the author didn't ask the bridesmaid. Even if they have the photos, altering another person's image in such a way could be considered an overstep. The bridesmaid might not want her natural hair color shown, or she might prefer to be seen with the blue hair as part of her style. The author made a decision for her, which is the crux of the issue. So, I think the answer is A.\n"
