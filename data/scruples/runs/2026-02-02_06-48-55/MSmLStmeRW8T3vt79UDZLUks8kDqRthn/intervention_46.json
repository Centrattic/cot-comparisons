      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who Photoshop'd a bridesmaid's hair color from iridescent blue to natural is in the wrong. They mentioned over 600 pictures and called it fun with a facepalm emoji.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The bridesmaid showed up with an unexpected hair color. The author changed it in the photos. The key points here are consent and intent. Did the bridesmaid agree to have her hair color edited? If she didn't, then it's a privacy issue. Also, the author took a lot of photos, which might be seen as intrusive or disrespectful. Even if the hair color was different, altering it without permission could be seen as violating the person's autonomy. The author's action might be a way to avoid dealing with the situation, but the bridesmaid's choice of hair color, even if random, is her own. So, altering it without consent could be wrong. On the other hand, some might argue it's the photographer's role to edit for the client's satisfaction. But in this case, it's the author's own wedding photos, so maybe the client is themselves. However, the bridesmaid is another person involved, so her consent is important. Since the author didn't ask, it's a gray area. But generally, editing someone's image without their permission could be considered respectful. So, I think the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
