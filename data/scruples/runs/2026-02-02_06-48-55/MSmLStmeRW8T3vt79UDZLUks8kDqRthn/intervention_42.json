      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who photoshopped a bridesmaid's hair color from iridescent blue to natural is in the wrong. The question is whether they should be the asshole (AITA) for doing that. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: the author is the person who did the editing. The bridesmaid showed up with blue hair for the wedding, which the author found random. They edited over 600 photos, changing the hair color. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants others' opinions.\n\nI need to consider the ethics here. Editing photos for a wedding is common, especially for the couple's portraits. But when it comes to other people in the photos, like guests, does the photographer have the right to alter their appearance? The bridesmaid chose her own hair color, even if the author didn't like it. However, the photos are part of the wedding documentation, and the couple might have final say over their photos. \n\nBut is it wrong to edit someone else's appearance without their consent? The bridesmaid didn't ask for it, so the author made a personal choice to change her hair. That could be seen as crossing a line, especially if it's done without asking her. On the other hand, the author might argue that it's their photos to edit as they see fit, since they are the ones paying for the service. \n\nAnother angle: weddings are personal events, and the couple usually has control over the photos they receive. If the author is the one who took the photos, they might feel ownership over the images. However, editing someone else's physical appearance in the photos could be considered disrespectful, as it's altering someone's identity without their knowledge or agreement. \n\nAlso, the number of photos edited (over 600) suggests a significant effort, which might not sit well with the bridesmaid if she found out. It's possible that the author's actions could cause embarrassment or upset the bridesmaid, especially if she wanted to showcase her blue hair as a personal choice. \n\nIn terms of social norms, people often have different opinions on this. Some might see it as harmless editing to fit the wedding's aesthetic, while others might view it as an invasion of privacy or disrespect towards the individual's choice. \n\nConsidering all these factors, I think the author might be in the wrong because they altered someone else's appearance without consent. Even if it's their photos, making such a personal change without the person's approval could be seen as inappropriate. However, there's a counter-argument that the photographer has the right to edit the photos as they see fit. \n\nBut given the context, where the author is the one who took the photos and is the one sharing them, their responsibility might lie in maintaining the integrity of the guests' appearances. So, the answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
