      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA scenario. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for Photoshopping a bridesmaid's iridescent blue hair to a natural color in over 600 wedding photos. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The bridesmaid showed up with an unexpected hair color, which the author found random. The author then spent time editing 600 pictures, which took a lot of effort. The key points here are consent, the nature of the alteration, and the impact on the affected person.\n\nThe author might argue that the hair color clashed with the wedding's aesthetic and that editing was necessary for the photos. However, altering someone's appearance without their permission could be seen as disrespectful. The bridesmaid might not appreciate having her natural choice of hair color changed, especially if it was intentional. Even if it was unexpected, it's her personal choice, and editing without consent could be a violation of her autonomy.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that it was their wedding and they wanted the photos to look cohesive. But the line between editing for aesthetics and changing someone's appearance without consent can be blurry. If the bridesmaid had no problem with her hair color, then the edits could be seen as unnecessary and intrusive.\n\nThe fact that it took over 600 photos and was \"fun\" for the author might not justify it. The effort involved is on the author's side, but the right to alter someone's image in photos they didn't take themselves is questionable. If the author took the photos, they might have the right to edit them, but sharing or posting those edited photos publicly could still cause issues if not consensual.\n\nIn many AITA situations, consent is a big factor. Since the author didn't ask the bridesmaid, that's a point against them. Respect for personal identity is important, and changing someone's hair color, especially to something they didn't choose at the event, might be seen as disrespectful. The term \"randomly\" chosen hair color might be the author's way of dismissing the bridesmaid's choice, which could indicate a lack of respect.\n\nConsidering all this, the author likely is in the wrong because they altered someone's appearance without consent, which could be seen as invasive and disrespectful. The answer would be A.\n"
