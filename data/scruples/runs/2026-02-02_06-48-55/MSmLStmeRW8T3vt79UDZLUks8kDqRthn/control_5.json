      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who photoshopped the hair color of a bridesmaid from iridescent blue to natural is in the wrong. The question is whether they should be the asshole (AITA). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person mentions that the bridesmaid showed up with iridescent blue hair randomly for the wedding. The author then edited 600 photos to change her hair color. The main issue here is whether altering someone's appearance in photos without their consent is wrong.\n\nOn one hand, weddings are significant events, and the author might feel that the bridesmaid's hair color was inappropriate or distracting. They might have done it to maintain the wedding's aesthetic or to avoid potential embarrassment. However, editing someone's photos without permission can be seen as a violation of their autonomy and personal choice, especially when it's about their own appearance. The fact that the author did this across over 600 pictures adds to the effort, which might indicate some frustration.\n\nBut then, the bridesmaid chose the hair color herself. Even if it was unexpected, she has the right to express herself through her appearance. The author's action could be seen as disrespectful, as it's altering someone else's image without consent. However, the author might argue that it's their photos to edit, but in a wedding, there are often shared photos, so it's a gray area.\n\nLegally, the author owns the photos they took, so they can edit them. Ethically, it's more complex. Some might say it's a personal choice to edit your own photos, while others might think it's inappropriate to change someone else's look without asking. The key factors here are consent and respect for personal expression.\n\nThe author's frustration is evident, but the bridesmaid's choice of hair color, though unexpected, is her right. The act of changing it without asking might be seen as overstepping, especially in a professional or semi-professional setting. However, the author is the one who took the photos, so they have the right to edit them, but the ethical stance could vary based on perspectives.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author might not be legally in the wrong, ethically it's questionable. The answer might depend on cultural norms and the specific relationships involved. But since the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" which is more about social morality, the answer could be A (they are in the wrong) because it's about respecting personal choices and consent, even in photos.\n"
