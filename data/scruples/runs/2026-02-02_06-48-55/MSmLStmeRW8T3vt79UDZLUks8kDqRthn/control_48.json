      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who photoshopped a bridesmaid's hair from iridescent blue to natural color is in the wrong. They posted over 600 photos and found it fun. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The bridesmaid showed up with an unexpected hair color, which the author didn't like. The act of editing photos is a personal choice, but does it cross a line here?\n\nThe key points are consent and intent. The author didn't ask the bridesmaid if they could change her hair in the photos. Modifying someone's appearance without their permission could be seen as disrespectful, especially in a sensitive event like a wedding. Even if the author found it amusing or entertaining, the bridesmaid might feel her choice of hair color was being altered without her input. \n\nAlso, the term \"randomly\" suggests disapproval of the hair color choice, which might imply judgment. The author's action could be perceived as a way to correct or normalize the bridesmaid's appearance, which isn't the author's right. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the photos are the author's property and they can edit them as they wish. But in group settings, especially weddings, there's an expectation of including others as they are. \n\nIn terms of social norms, people often have different opinions on such matters. The bride might be more concerned than the groom, but the question is about the author's wrongdoing. \n\nI think the answer leans towards A (the author is in the wrong) because of the lack of consent and potential disrespect towards the bridesmaid's personal choice.\n"
