      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who Photoshop-ed a bridesmaid's hair from iridescent blue to a natural color is in the wrong. The original post is from a husband who did this to over 600 wedding photos. He mentions the color was \"randomly\" chosen, which might imply he disagrees with the choice. \n\nFirst, I need to think about the ethics here. The bridesmaid didn't consent to this change. Even if the husband thought the blue was inappropriate for the wedding, altering someone's appearance without their permission could be a privacy issue. The bridesmaid might have wanted to express herself that way, and changing it without asking could be seen as disrespectful.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the blue hair was distracting in the photos, and the husband was trying to make the pictures more cohesive. But that's a stretch. The key point is consent. Without consent, editing someone's image after the fact isn't okay. Also, the fact that there were 600 photos is a lot, so it's a significant effort. The author might not realize that this crosses a line.\n\nSo, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he altered someone else's image without their permission, which is a breach of privacy and respect.\n"
