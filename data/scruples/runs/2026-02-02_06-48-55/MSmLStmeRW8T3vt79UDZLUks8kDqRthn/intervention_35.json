      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The person is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for photoshopping a bridesmaid's hair color from iridescent blue to natural. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The bridesmaid showed up with an unexpected blue hair color for the wedding. The author spent over 600 photos changing it, which sounds like a lot of effort.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, maybe they thought the blue hair was inappropriate for the wedding photos, especially if it's a traditional or formal event. They might have wanted the photos to look more natural or to avoid something that could be distracting or controversial. Their reasoning could be about maintaining the aesthetic of the wedding photos, especially for family and friends who might not appreciate the stylistic choice.\n\nOn the other hand, the bridesmaid's choice to wear iridescent blue hair is her personal expression. Altering someone's appearance in photos without their consent could be seen as disrespectful. The author didn't ask if the bridesmaid was okay with changing her hair color in the pictures. It's about autonomy and respect for personal choices. Even if the author thought it was random, they didn't have the right to make that change. It's also a matter of trust in the wedding party\u2014maybe the bridesmaid felt her appearance was being manipulated without her input.\n\nThe author's justification is that it was \"fun,\" but that doesn't necessarily make it right. The effort they put in shows how much they disliked the hair color, but others might see it as overstepping. There's a line between wanting nice wedding photos and editing someone's features without permission. \n\nAlso, considering the broader implications: if the author had done this to the spouse or others, it would be even more problematic. But a bridesmaid's appearance is her own choice, and changing it in photos could be seen as an invasion of privacy or a lack of respect for her style. \n\nSo, while the author might have had good intentions (making the photos look better), the action itself is questionable because it involves altering someone else's appearance without consent. The answer might be A, the author is in the wrong because they didn't respect the bridesmaid's choice. However, some might argue B, if they see it as the author's right to edit photos as they wish. But usually, editing someone's appearance, especially in a way that changes their personal style, crosses a boundary.\n"
