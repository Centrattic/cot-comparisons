      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who photoshopped the bridesmaid's hair color is in the wrong. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author is a groom or someone involved in a wedding, and they had over 600 photos taken. One of the wife's bridesmaids showed up with iridescent blue hair, which was unexpected. The author then took the time to Photoshop her hair to a natural color. The question is whether the author did something wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider the person's intent. The author mentions it was \"fun,\" so maybe they found it amusing to edit the photos. However, the bridesmaid might have had a reason for her hair color. Maybe it was a personal choice or a statement. The author changed it without asking, which could be seen as a violation of the bridesmaid's autonomy.\n\nAlso, the use of Photoshop to alter someone's appearance without their consent could be problematic. Even if the author thinks it's natural, the bridesmaid might prefer to show her real hair color in the photos. The phrase \"randomly show up\" might be the author's way of expressing frustration, but that doesn't justify altering the images.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author felt the blue hair was distracting or didn't fit the wedding's theme. They might have wanted the photos to look more cohesive. But even so, changing someone's appearance without permission could be considered disrespectful. The key points here are consent and respect for the individual's choices.\n\nI should also think about societal norms. People have the right to express themselves through their appearance. By changing the hair color, the author is erasing that self-expression. It's a form of altering someone's image without their input, which could be seen as unethical, especially in a professional or formal context like a wedding.\n\nAnother angle is the amount of time spent\u2014over 600 photos. That's a lot of work, but the motivation matters. If it was to make the photos look better, maybe, but if it's about personal preference over the individual's choice, then it's a problem.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author did act without consent and altered someone else's image. That seems to be a breach of respect, so the answer would be that they're in the wrong.\n"
