      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading the situation again.\n\nThe author is asking if they're at fault for photoshopping a bridesmaid's hair color from iridescent blue to natural. The context is their wife's wedding, and the bridesmaid showed up with unexpected blue hair. The author took over 600 photos and found it \"fun\" to edit the hair color back. They used an emoji that shows face-palming, indicating frustration or embarrassment maybe.\n\nFirst, I should consider the ethics of altering someone's appearance without permission. The bridesmaid might have wanted to express themselves with the blue hair, and editing it out could be seen as dismissing their personal choice. On the other hand, the wedding photos are the couple's, so they might have a right to edit them as they see fit, especially if the color was distracting or didn't fit the wedding's aesthetic. \n\nBut there's also a privacy and consent aspect. The author didn't ask the bridesmaid if it was okay to change her hair color in the photos. Even if it's their own photos, altering someone's appearance without their consent could be intrusive. The bridesmaid might feel their personal style was erased, which could lead to hurt feelings.\n\nHowever, the author might argue that it's their wedding and they want the photos to look a certain way for their memories. Plus, iridescent blue might not be typical for a wedding photo, so they might prefer a more traditional look. But then again, the bridesmaid's choice to wear blue was a personal expression, and the author is overriding that. \n\nI should also think about societal norms. In some circles, bright hair colors are accepted, especially for special events. If the bridesmaid chose that color for the wedding, she might have intended to showcase it. Editing it out could be seen as disrespectful. On the flip side, the author is the one who took the photos and is using them for their own purposes, so they might have the right to edit for their preferences.\n\nAnother angle: the author did it \"for fun\" and took 600+ pics, which suggests it was a project they enjoyed. But maybe the bridesmaid wasn't aware of this. If the edited photos are the only ones the author will share, the bridesmaid might not get to have their true appearance represented. \n\nI think the key points are consent and respect for personal expression. Since the author didn't get permission, it's a gray area. Some might say the author is in the wrong for altering someone else's appearance without consent, while others might side with the author's right to edit their own photos. But considering the potential for the bridesmaid to be upset about their choice being changed, the author might be in the wrong. So maybe answer A.\n"
