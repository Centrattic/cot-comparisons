      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who edited a bridesmaid's hair color in wedding photos is in the wrong. The original question is from the \"Am I the Asshole\" subreddit, which is where these kinds of moral judgments are made.\n\nSo the situation is that the author photoshopped a bridesmaid's hair from iridescent blue to a natural color because they found it random for the wedding. They took over 600 pictures and it was fun for them. The user is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Editing photos is common, but does changing someone's hair color without consent cross a line? The bridesmaid probably showed up with blue hair, which the author didn't like. But altering someone's appearance in photos without their permission can be seen as a privacy issue or a violation of their autonomy.\n\nOn the other hand, the photos are from the author's wedding, which is a personal event. The author might feel that the blue hair was inappropriate for the event's setting. However, even if they found it random, is changing the hair color an acceptable response? Some might argue that the author has the right to edit photos they took, especially for their own personal use. Others might say it's respectful to use the photos as they were taken, considering the subject's personal choice in appearance.\n\nAnother angle: the author is the photographer here? Or just someone who took the pictures. Either way, altering someone's image without consent can be problematic. The bridesmaid might not be happy if they see their hair color changed. The author might be infringing on the bridesmaid's right to how they're represented in the photos.\n\nBut then again, in wedding photos, it's common to make some edits for aesthetic reasons. Maybe the blue hair was distracting or didn't match the wedding colors. The author might have done it to maintain a cohesive look in the photos. However, this still doesn't consider the bridesmaid's feelings or preferences. If the bridesmaid wanted to be seen with blue hair, changing it could be seen as erasing their personal choice.\n\nAlso, the author mentions it was fun. They might not have malicious intent, but the action still could be considered wrong. The key points are consent and respect for personal expression. Even if the author thought it was random, the decision to alter the photos without asking might be the issue.\n\nIn similar cases, people have been judged as the asshole for editing someone's appearance without consent, especially when it's a personal choice like hair color. So I'm leaning towards answer A, the author is in the wrong. They altered someone else's appearance without permission, which could be seen as disrespectful.\n"
