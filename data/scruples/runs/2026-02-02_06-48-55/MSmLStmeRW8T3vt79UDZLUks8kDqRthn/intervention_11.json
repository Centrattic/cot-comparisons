      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for editing a bridesmaid's hair color in wedding photos. The situation is that the bridesmaid showed up with iridescent blue hair, which the author found random and decided to change to a natural color using Photoshop. The user thinks the author is in the wrong and wants a second opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics and social norms around photo editing. Generally, altering someone's appearance in photos without their consent can be a gray area. If the change is minor, like adjusting lighting or removing blemishes, it's often accepted. But changing a significant feature like hair color, especially without permission, might be problematic. \n\nThe key points here are consent and context. The author didn't ask the bridesmaid if it's okay to change her hair color. The bridesmaid made a choice to have blue hair, which might be her personal style. The author modified 600 pictures, which is a lot and might be more impactful. The author's reasoning is that the blue hair was \"random,\" implying disapproval of the choice. \n\nHowever, the wedding is the author's event, and they might feel a need to maintain a certain aesthetic in the photos. On the other hand, the bridesmaid's appearance is her own choice, and editing it could be seen as a violation of her autonomy. \n\nIn some cases, people might argue that photos are the photographer's or the couple's to edit as they see fit. But if the bridesmaid would be uncomfortable seeing her hair color altered without her knowledge, that could be an issue. The author's approach might come off as dismissive of the bridesmaid's personal expression. \n\nSo, considering all this, it seems the author acted without consent and possibly overstepped by making a significant change on a large scale. Therefore, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong.\n"
