      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who photoshopped a bridesmaid's iridescent blue hair to a natural color is in the wrong. The original poster (AITA) claims they did this because the bridesmaid showed up with random blue hair for the wedding, and they took over 600 pictures, calling it fun with a facepalm emoji.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The bridesmaid chose to have iridescent blue hair, which is unconventional but her personal choice. The author altered the photos without permission. Now, the question is about whether this action was wrong.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, altering someone's appearance in photos without their consent can be an issue of respect for their autonomy and personal expression. The bridesmaid might have wanted her look to be represented as is in the wedding photos. The author's justification is that it was random and they found it funny, but that might not be a valid reason for editing someone else's image without asking.\n\nHowever, some might argue that it's the photographer's or the person's own photos, so they have the right to edit them as they see fit. But when it comes to a wedding, there's a shared experience, and guests might expect their appearance to be accurately captured. The alteration could be seen as disrespecting the bridesmaid's choice and possibly causing embarrassment or distress.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that there are over 600 photos suggests a significant amount of editing, which might be more intrusive. The author's tone with the facepalm emoji indicates a dismissive attitude towards the bridesmaid's choice, which could come off as judgmental.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might not have malicious intent, just found the hair color amusing. But intent versus impact\u2014regardless of the intent, the action could be hurtful. The bridesmaid might feel that her personal choice was not respected, especially in such a public and important event like a wedding.\n\nSo, weighing these factors, the author's action of photoshopping the hair without consent could be considered wrong because it disregards the bridesmaid's autonomy and personal expression, even if done in a humorous or lighthearted manner.\n"
