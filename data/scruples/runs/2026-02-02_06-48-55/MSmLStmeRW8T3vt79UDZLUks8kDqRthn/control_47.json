      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who photoshopped a bridesmaid's hair from iridescent blue to a natural color is in the wrong. The situation is about a wedding photo where one of the wife's bridesmaids showed up with an unexpected blue hair color. The author did this to over 600 pictures and found it \"fun,\" using the facepalm emoji.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of altering someone's image without permission. Even though it's a wedding photo, which is a personal event, the bride and groom usually have some say in how the photos turn out. However, the bridesmaid's choice to wear iridescent blue hair is her personal decision. The author is changing her appearance, which could be seen as respecting (maybe the spouse was uncomfortable) or as an overreach.\n\nBut wait, the author is the photographer here? Or the person who took the photos? The original question is about the person who wrote this, so maybe the author is the one handling the wedding photos. The key point is whether they had the right to alter someone's hair color without asking. Bridesmaids might have their own preferences, and changing their hair could be a personal choice. The author might have done it to make the photo more aesthetically pleasing or to avoid an unusual color that clashes. However, it's not their decision to make, especially if the bridesmaid didn't consent. \n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. In many cases, editing photos, especially for personal use, is considered acceptable if the intent is not harmful. However, if the photos are going to be used publicly or in a professional capacity, altering someone's appearance without consent could be problematic. Since this is a wedding, the photos are likely personal, but the bridesmaid might have wanted her true look to be preserved. \n\nThe humor in the post (\"over 600 pics...it was fun\") suggests the author might be joking about the effort rather than being serious. Still, the act itself could be controversial. The answer would depend on context like consent and purpose. If the author didn't ask and the bridesmaid might be upset, then maybe AITA. But if the spouse was uncomfortable and the author did it to make the photos more acceptable for the couple, some might argue it's not wrong. \n\nBut generally, editing someone's appearance without their permission, even in a personal event, can be seen as crossing a line. So the answer might be A (in the wrong). However, some might say it's not a big deal since it's a personal photo. The key here is whether the alteration is considered respectful or not. Since the hair color was \"random,\" the author might have been trying to maintain a certain look for the wedding. But again, the bridesmaid's choice to wear that color should be respected. \n\nI think the answer would be A, because altering someone's appearance without consent, even if it's a wedding photo, is generally considered wrong. People might have different opinions, but the act itself is a violation of their autonomy in the image.\n"
