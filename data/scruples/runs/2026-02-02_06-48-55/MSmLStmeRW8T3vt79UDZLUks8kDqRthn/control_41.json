      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who photoshopped a bridesmaid's hair from iridescent blue to a natural color is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person is a groom, right? He's talking about his wife's wedding. The bridesmaid showed up with an unexpected blue hair color, maybe something that wasn't approved or just a last-minute decision. The groom then edited over 600 photos to change that hair color. He's asking if he's at fault here.\n\nSo, the key points are: the groom altered photos of a bridesmaid without her permission. The hair color was iridescent blue, which the groom found random. He spent time editing all the pictures for the wedding. The question is whether this action was wrong.\n\nNow, from an ethical standpoint, editing someone's appearance in photos without their consent could be an issue. People have the right to how they present themselves in photographs, especially in professional or important events like a wedding. Even if the groom found the hair color inappropriate, he didn't have the right to change it in the photos. That could be seen as a violation of the bridesmaid's autonomy and personal choice.\n\nBut maybe there's another angle. The groom might have felt that the hair color was unflattering or didn't fit the wedding's theme. However, the solution was to edit the photos rather than address it directly. The bridesmaid could have been offended by the change, even if the groom had good intentions. The act of editing without consent could lead to feelings of disrespect or invasion of privacy.\n\nOn the other hand, the groom might argue that it was just a personal choice to make the photos look better for the album. But the problem is that the bridesmaid's appearance was altered without their knowledge. Even if it was for the wedding, the groom doesn't own the rights to the bridesmaid's image. There's a difference between editing the background or lighting and changing someone's appearance. It's more personal.\n\nAlso, considering the effort\u2014600 photos is a lot. It shows that the groom took the time to do this, which might indicate he felt strongly about it. But that doesn't justify the action. If the groom had concerns, he should have communicated with the bridesmaid before the event. If that wasn't possible, maybe he should have discussed it with her after the wedding instead of editing the photos without her input.\n\nIn terms of social norms, people often choose unique hair colors for events, especially if it's their own wedding. The term \"randomly show up with\" suggests the groom found it unexpected or unprofessional. However, it's not his place to dictate someone else's appearance unless there's a specific reason, like a dress code he was aware of. If the wedding had a strict theme, maybe there was an expectation, but the bridesmaid might not have known that.\n\nIn conclusion, the groom did act without the bridesmaid's consent, which is a breach of her autonomy. Even if his intention was to preserve a certain look for the wedding photos, the action itself was inappropriate. Therefore, the answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
