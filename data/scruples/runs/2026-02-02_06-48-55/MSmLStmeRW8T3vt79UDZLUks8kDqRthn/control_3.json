      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who photoshopped a bridesmaid's hair from iridescent blue to natural color is in the wrong. The context is a wedding, where the bridesmaid showed up with an unexpected hair color.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of altering someone's image without their permission. The person did this over 600 times, which seems excessive. Even if the intention was to make the photos look better, it's a private image of someone else. The bridesmaid might not have wanted her hair color changed. It's about consent. The author didn't ask the bridesmaid if it was okay to edit her hair. That's a key point.\n\nThen there's the aspect of the relationship. The author is the one who did this, and it's part of their wedding photos. But the bridesmaid's choice of hair color was her own, even if the author found it random. The author might be projecting their own preferences onto the photos. However, the photos are of the author's wedding, so there's a balance between personal preference and respecting others' autonomy.\n\nAnother angle is the context of the event. Weddings are personal events, but the images are shared with others. Altering someone's appearance significantly might affect how the bridesmaid is perceived. The iridescent blue could be a statement, and changing it might erase her personal expression. \n\nAlso, the humor or light-hearted tone in the post (\"over 600 pics...it was fun\") might downplay the seriousness of the act. But the question is about right and wrong, not just whether it's funny.\n\nI should also think about whether there's a cultural or societal norm that supports altering photos. In some cases, minor edits are common, but changing someone's hair color drastically without consent crosses a line. The key distinction here is consent and the extent of the alteration. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author didn't get consent to change the bridesmaid's hair color, which is a personal and visible feature. Even though it's a wedding photo, the bridesmaid has the right to how her image is presented. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they edited someone else's appearance without permission.\n"
