      "text": "Okay, let's think about this. The user is asking if the person who photoshopped a bridesmaid's hair from iridescent blue to natural color is in the wrong. The situation is a wedding, which is a big event with many photos.\n\nFirst, the author's reasoning: They had over 600 pictures and found it \"fun\" to change the hair color. The bride's bridesmaid showed up with an unexpected blue hair color. The key points here are consent and intent. \n\nThe bridesmaid didn't ask for her hair to be altered. Even if the blue was random, the author made a decision without asking her. Photoshopping someone's appearance can be a privacy issue. The author might be trying to fit the bridesmaid into a certain aesthetic, maybe to make the photos look more traditional or cohesive, but that's their choice. However, without consent, altering someone's image could be seen as disrespectful. \n\nOn the other hand, weddings are personal events, and the author might feel that the bride's preferences should be respected. But the bridesmaid is an individual who chose her own hair color. The author's action could be considered as overstepping, especially if the bridesmaid wanted to express herself through her hair. \n\nAlso, the tone of the original post mentions \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole), which implies the author is questioning their own actions. The responder's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong. Considering all angles, the lack of consent and the alteration without the bridesmaid's approval seems like a violation of her autonomy, even if the motive was to make the photos look better. So, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
