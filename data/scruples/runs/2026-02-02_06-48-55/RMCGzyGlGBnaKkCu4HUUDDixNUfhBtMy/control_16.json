      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for denying his terminally ill wife the chance to have a baby. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple is young, in their mid-20s. The wife has a terminal illness with a prognosis of 2-3 years. Initially, having a baby was impossible because it would kill her, so the author didn't want one. Now, she's considering other methods (maybe surrogacy or other medical interventions) to have a child. She really wants to be a mother, and the author feels conflicted.\n\nThe author's main arguments are that he doesn't want a baby, doesn't want to take care of a child while also caring for a dying wife, and doesn't want his child to go through losing a parent. He also references his own father dying when he was 3, and how that affected his mother. He's worried about the emotional toll and feels it's selfish to agree to this.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's desire to be a mother is strong. She might feel this is her last chance to fulfill a lifelong dream. The author is denying her that opportunity, which could be seen as not supporting her wishes, especially given her terminal condition. But is it his call to make? Do they have the right to make such decisions together, or is one overriding the other?\n\nThe ethical angle here is complex. The author is prioritizing his own emotional capacity and future well-being. However, denying his wife's wish to become a mother could be seen as a lack of support in her final years. The question is whether his decision is selfish or a responsible choice. \n\nThe author isn't being cruel for his own desires; he's considering the long-term impact on himself and any child. But he's also taking away a significant possibility for his wife. The answer might depend on whether the decision is mutual or if one is overriding the other. If the wife is still pushing despite his objections, there might be a conflict in priorities. However, since the author is the one making the final decision (as per the question), the key is whether his refusal is justifiable.\n\nIn many cases, such decisions require mutual agreement. If the wife is insistent and the author refuses, he's denying her a choice. But given the circumstances, his concerns about the child's future and his own capacity are valid. It's a tough balance between personal desires and practical realities. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether it's the author's right to deny the child. If they are in a committed relationship, both partners' wishes matter. But since the author is the one making the decision here, and he's not being a \"prick\" as he admits, maybe he's justified. However, the wife's right to fulfill her maternal desires is also important. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because his reasons are based on realistic concerns about the future. However, there's a strong argument that he should support his wife's wish, especially given her terminal condition. But given the practical aspects and his own history, maybe his decision is understandable. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
