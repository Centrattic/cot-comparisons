Just to have her die and leave me a 28 year old guy with a 3 year old baby I never wanted with a dead mother. \n\nMy father died when I was 3, I wouldn't wish it on anyone. I don't want that for my child. I watched my mother from an early age looking after me and my sister with no help from a partner, she still has crippling anxiety issues and it's effected her massively.\n\n I know what's ahead of me and it's going to be fucking rough.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for denying his terminally ill wife the chance to be a mother. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the wife is terminally ill, probably with 2-3 years left. She was told initially that having a baby would kill her, but now she's looking into other methods. The author doesn't want a baby and is concerned about the future. He mentions his own father died when he was 3, and he doesn't want his child to go through that. He also talks about his mother's anxiety and how taking care of a child plus a dying wife would be too much for him. He says he wants to go into a depression after she dies and can't handle a baby.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's being selfish or if his decision is valid. On one hand, the wife wants to be a mother and the author is denying her that dream. On the other hand, he's considering the practical and emotional toll of raising a child while dealing with her illness and then her death. \n\nI need to consider both perspectives. The wife's wish to be a mother is significant, but the author is also trying to protect himself from future trauma. There's a balance between respecting her desires and his own capacity to handle the situation. \n\nIs it selfish? The author is prioritizing his own well-being and the child's well-being, arguing that raising a child under such circumstances could be harmful. However, denying her the chance to fulfill her dream could be seen as not supporting her fully. But maybe the author is realistic about his limitations. \n\nThe answer might depend on whether the decision is about his own inability to handle it versus her wish. The AITA (Am I the Asshole) context often looks for whether someone is being unkind or inconsiderate. Here, the author is considering future scenarios and his capacity. But is he being selfish? He does express empathy for his wife's desire but can't commit. In AITA scenarios, sometimes the \"selfish\" answer is considered if someone's needs are prioritized over others, but in this case, the author is also considering the child's well-being. \n\nI think the answer is B: No, he's not in the wrong. He's making a difficult decision based on his circumstances and the potential impact on everyone involved. The question is complex, but the author isn't being a prick here\u2014he's being honest about his limitations.\n"
