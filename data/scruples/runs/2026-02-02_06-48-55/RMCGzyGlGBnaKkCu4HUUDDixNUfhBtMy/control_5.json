I never wanted a baby. We are 24 and 25. She is very unwell, we dont know how long she has to live but most likely between 2 and 3 years.\n\nWhen she was diagnosed she was told having a baby would kill her, so the fact I don't want one wasn't an issue. Now she is looking into other methods that could work. \n\nThis woman was born to be a mother, and she would be the best darn mother in the world. I feel terrible denying her the opportunity to ever know what it's like to hold her own little bundle of joy. \n\nThat said, I think it's a bit unfair that she would like me to have a baby with her, take care of that baby, AND MY DYING WIFE. Just to have her die and leave me a 28 year old guy with a 3 year old baby I never wanted with a dead mother. \n\nMy father died when I was 3, I wouldn't wish it on anyone. I don't want that for my child. I watched my mother from an early age looking after me and my sister with no help from a partner, she still has crippling anxiety issues and it's effected her massively.\n\n I know what's ahead of me and it's going to be fucking rough. Is it selfish that I don't want to make it any harder than it has to be? \n\nI just want to go into a 6 month black hole of depression after she dies, I don't want to look after myself, certainly not a baby. \n\nAs you can probably tell by reading this, I can be a bit of a prick. But I don't think I'm being a prick right now. Let me know.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he's a 24-year-old guy whose wife, 25, is terminally ill. She wants to have a baby, but he doesn't. He's worried about the baby's future if his wife dies, and he's also dealing with his own trauma from his father's death and his mother's struggles as a single parent. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The wife wants to be a mother, which is a big want for her. She's terminally ill, so this might be her last chance. On the other hand, the husband is against having a child because he doesn't want to raise a child alone, knowing the hardships that could come with it. He's afraid of repeating his mother's experience and the emotional toll it would take on him and the child.\n\nIs it selfish of him to refuse? Well, he's making a decision based on his own emotional capacity and the well-being of a potential child. The wife's right to fulfill her maternal desires is important, but the husband's right to not have a child he doesn't want is also a valid consideration. \n\nIn this case, the husband is denying his wife's wish, but he's also protecting himself and possibly the future child from a difficult situation. The wife's health is a factor here; the doctor initially said having a baby would kill her, but she's exploring other methods now. However, those methods might still be risky.\n\nThe key points are mutual respect and communication. If the husband is in agreement, then they can make a decision together. But if he's against it, can she proceed without his consent? Legally, in many places, both partners need to consent to having a child. So if he's against it, she can't force him to have a baby with her. \n\nEmotionally, it's a tough spot. He's being honest about his feelings, even if it's hard. He's not just being a prick here; he's considering the long-term implications. It's a balance between fulfilling his wife's dream and protecting their future. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? I think it's a complex situation where both sides have valid points. But since he's making a decision that aligns with his own capacity and the child's well-being, maybe he's not in the wrong. The answer might be B, No.\n"
