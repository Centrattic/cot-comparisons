I never wanted a baby. We are 24 and 25. She is very unwell, we dont know how long she has to live but most likely between 2 and 3 years.\n\nWhen she was diagnosed she was told having a baby would kill her, so the fact I don't want one wasn't an issue. Now she is looking into other methods that could work. \n\nThis woman was born to be a mother, and she would be the best darn mother in the world. I feel terrible denying her the opportunity to ever know what it's like to hold her own little bundle of joy. \n\nThat said, I think it's a bit unfair that she would like me to have a baby with her, take care of that baby, AND MY DYING WIFE. Just to have her die and leave me a 28 year old guy with a 3 year old baby I never wanted with a dead mother. \n\nMy father died when I was 3, I wouldn't wish it on anyone. I don't want that for my child. I watched my mother from an early age looking after me and my sister with no help from a partner, she still has crippling anxiety issues and it's effected her massively.\n\n I know what's ahead of me and it's going to be fucking rough. Is it selfish that I don't want to make it any harder than it has to be? \n\nI just want to go into a 6 month black hole of depression after she dies, I don't want to look after myself, certainly not a baby. \n\nAs you can probably tell by reading this, I can be a bit of a prick.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for denying his terminally ill wife the chance to be a mother. The situation is pretty complex. The wife is very ill, maybe 2-3 years left. She wants to have a baby, but the author doesn't. He doesn't want a child because he's worried about the future\u2014raising a child alone after she dies, dealing with his own grief, and not wanting his child to experience loss at a young age. He also mentions his own father died when he was 3, which affects his perspective.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The wife's autonomy versus the husband's right to refuse. The wife has a strong desire to be a mother, which is a personal and important goal for her. But the husband is concerned about the practical and emotional challenges of raising a child alone after her death. There's also the medical aspect: initially, having a baby was considered life-threatening for her, but now she's looking into other methods. The husband's main argument is that he doesn't want to take on the responsibility of a child, not out of selfishness, but because of the trauma he experienced as a child when his father died.\n\nNow, the question is whether denying her wish makes him wrong. On one hand, respecting her autonomy and her desire to be a mother is important. She might feel that this is her last chance to fulfill a lifelong dream. On the other hand, the husband has valid concerns about his ability to handle the situation, especially considering his past and the potential impact on a future child.\n\nI should also think about the legal and ethical frameworks. Typically, reproductive decisions are joint, but if one partner refuses, there's a gray area, especially in cases of terminal illness. However, since the wife is the one with the medical risk, the husband's consent is necessary. But is it ethical for him to deny her a chance to become a mother if she's capable, even if it's not his desire?\n\nAnother angle: the husband is prioritizing his own well-being and the child's well-being. He doesn't want the child to go through losing a parent, similar to his experience. That's a valid concern, but it's also his own fear of depression and inability to care for himself or a child after her death. So is that selfish? Or is it a realistic assessment of his capacity?\n\nI think there's no clear right or wrong here. The husband's feelings are understandable, given his background. However, denying his wife's wish might be seen as prioritizing his own comfort over her last wish. But he's also considering the child's future. The key is whether there's a way to find a middle ground, like exploring other options that might satisfy her desire without him having to take full responsibility. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong. \n\nGiven that, maybe the answer isn't straightforward. However, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to decide whether the husband's refusal is justified. If he's not being selfish but rather realistic about his limitations, then maybe he's not in the wrong. But if the wife's wish is so important to her, it's a hard choice. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because he's making a decision based on his own capacity and the child's well-being. He's not forcing her to do anything but he's refusing to participate in a way that would create additional suffering for himself and potentially the child. So answer B.\n"
