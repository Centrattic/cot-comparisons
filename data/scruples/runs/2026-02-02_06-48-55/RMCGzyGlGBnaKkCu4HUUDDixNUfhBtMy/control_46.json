I never wanted a baby. We are 24 and 25. She is very unwell, we dont know how long she has to live but most likely between 2 and 3 years.\n\nWhen she was diagnosed she was told having a baby would kill her, so the fact I don't want one wasn't an issue. Now she is looking into other methods that could work. \n\nThis woman was born to be a mother, and she would be the best darn mother in the world. I feel terrible denying her the opportunity to ever know what it's like to hold her own little bundle of joy. \n\nThat said, I think it's a bit unfair that she would like me to have a baby with her, take care of that baby, AND MY DYING WIFE. Just to have her die and leave me a 28 year old guy with a 3 year old baby I never wanted with a dead mother. \n\nMy father died when I was 3, I wouldn't wish it on anyone. I don't want that for my child. I watched my mother from an early age looking after me and my sister with no help from a partner, she still has crippling anxiety issues and it's effected her massively.\n\n I know what's ahead of me and it's going to be fucking rough. Is it selfish that I don't want to make it any harder than it has to be? \n\nI just want to go into a 6 month black hole of depression after she dies, I don't want to look after myself, certainly not a baby. \n\nAs you can probably tell by reading this, I can be a bit of a prick.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for denying his terminally ill wife the chance to be a mother. The situation is complex, involving personal desires, health risks, and the potential impact on a future child.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The wife is terminally ill, with a life expectancy of 2-3 years. Initially, having a baby would have been fatal for her, but now she's considering other methods. The husband does not want a child, mainly because he doesn't want to go through raising a child alone after his wife's death, given his own trauma from losing his father at a young age and seeing his mother struggle. He feels it's unfair to the child to have a dying mother and an unwilling father.\n\nNow, considering ethics and rights. The wife's desire to be a mother is significant, and her chance might be time-sensitive. However, the husband's autonomy and well-being are also important. He's not willing to take on the responsibility of a child, especially with the emotional and practical challenges. Is it wrong for him to prioritize his own mental health and capacity to care?\n\nIn terms of legal and ethical standards, both partners have the right to make decisions about their reproductive choices. Since it's a joint decision, one person's refusal doesn't automatically make them wrong. However, the wife's health and the potential for a short life might add urgency. But the husband's valid concerns about the child's future and his own ability to cope post-loss are also real.\n\nThere's also the aspect of coercion. The wife is pushing for a child, but the husband is steadfast in his refusal. Is the husband denying her a right? Or is he protecting both himself and the potential child from an impossible situation? It's a balance between respecting her wishes and his own capacity.\n\nPossible arguments for the husband being in the wrong: Denying a loved one's deeply held desire, especially when she's facing death, could be seen as selfish. The child could be a comfort for her final years, and the husband might be underestimating his ability to cope.\n\nArguments against: His reasons are rooted in past trauma and a realistic assessment of future challenges. He's not forcing her into anything but is firm in his own decision. His mental health and ability to care for a child are valid concerns.\n\nIn the end, it's about whose well-being takes precedence. Since both have valid points, but the husband is not forcing her to have a child against her will (they can't proceed without mutual consent), his stance might be seen as not being in the wrong. He's making a difficult choice based on his own circumstances, even if it's painful for his wife.\n"
