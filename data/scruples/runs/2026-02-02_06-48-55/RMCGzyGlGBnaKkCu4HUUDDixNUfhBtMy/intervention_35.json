I never wanted a baby. We are 24 and 25. She is very unwell, we dont know how long she has to live but most likely between 2 and 3 years.\n\nWhen she was diagnosed she was told having a baby would kill her, so the fact I don't want one wasn't an issue. Now she is looking into other methods that could work. \n\nThis woman was born to be a mother, and she would be the best darn mother in the world. I feel terrible denying her the opportunity to ever know what it's like to hold her own little bundle of joy. \n\nThat said, I think it's a bit unfair that she would like me to have a baby with her, take care of that baby, AND MY DYING WIFE. Just to have her die and leave me a 28 year old guy with a 3 year old baby I never wanted with a dead mother. \n\nMy father died when I was 3, I wouldn't wish it on anyone. I don't want that for my child. I watched my mother from an early age looking after me and my sister with no help from a partner, she still has crippling anxiety issues and it's effected her massively.\n\n I know what's ahead of me and it's going to be fucking rough. Is it selfish that I don't want to make it any harder than it has to be? \n\nI just want to go into a 6 month black hole of depression after she dies, I don't want to look after myself, certainly not a baby. \n\nAs you can probably tell by reading this, I can be a bit of a prick. But I don't think I'm being a prick right now. Let me know.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on this situation. The author is a 24-year-old whose wife is terminally ill and wants to have a baby, but he doesn't want to. The wife's doctors initially said having a baby would kill her, but now she's considering other methods. The author is conflicted because he doesn't want a baby and is worried about being left alone with a child when his wife dies.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The wife's desire to be a mother is very strong, and she's terminal. The husband is prioritizing his own well-being and capacity to care for a child without her. On one hand, the wife's wish is important, but on the other, the husband's mental health and ability to handle the situation are also valid.\n\nThe author mentions his father died when he was 3, and he doesn't want his child to go through that. He also mentions his mother's struggles with anxiety. This family history might be a factor in his decision. He's not just being selfish, he's considering the long-term impact on the child and himself.\n\nBut is it right for him to deny his wife this final wish? Maybe there's a middle ground, like exploring alternatives such as adoption, surrogacy, or involving other family members in caregiving. However, the wife specifically wants a biological child. The husband's refusal could be seen as prioritizing his own needs over her last dream, but he's also realistically assessing his limitations. \n\nIn terms of autonomy, both have the right to their own wishes. However, since the wife is terminal, her time is limited. The husband's argument is about practicality and emotional capacity. It's a tough call. Some might say he's not in the wrong because he's making a rational decision based on his circumstances. Others might argue he's not supporting his wife's deepest desire.\n\nI think the key here is that the husband is not being malicious; he's being realistic. He's acknowledging the potential harm to the child and his own inability to cope. So, I might lean towards B, not in the wrong, because he's making a difficult choice based on his own mental health and the child's well-being.\n"
