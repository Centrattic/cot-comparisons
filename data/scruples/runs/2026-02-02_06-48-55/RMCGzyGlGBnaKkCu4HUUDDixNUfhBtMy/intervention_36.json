I never wanted a baby. We are 24 and 25. She is very unwell, we dont know how long she has to live but most likely between 2 and 3 years.\n\nWhen she was diagnosed she was told having a baby would kill her, so the fact I don't want one wasn't an issue. Now she is looking into other methods that could work. \n\nThis woman was born to be a mother, and she would be the best darn mother in the world. I feel terrible denying her the opportunity to ever know what it's like to hold her own little bundle of joy. \n\nThat said, I think it's a bit unfair that she would like me to have a baby with her, take care of that baby, AND MY DYING WIFE. Just to have her die and leave me a 28 year old guy with a 3 year old baby I never wanted with a dead mother. \n\nMy father died when I was 3, I wouldn't wish it on anyone. I don't want that for my child. I watched my mother from an early age looking after me and my sister with no help from a partner, she still has crippling anxiety issues and it's effected her massively.\n\n I know what's ahead of me and it's going to be fucking rough. Is it selfish that I don't want to make it any harder than it has to be? \n\nI just want to go into a 6 month black hole of depression after she dies, I don't want to look after myself, certainly not a baby. \n\nAs you can probably tell by reading this, I can be a bit of a prick. But I don't think I'm being a prick right now. Let me know.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that his wife is terminally ill, and she wants to be a mother, but he doesn't want to have a baby. He's worried about the child's future if the wife dies and about his own ability to cope with depression after her death.\n\nFirst, I should consider both sides. The wife's desire to be a mother is strong, and she's given up that option because initially, having a baby would have been life-threatening. Now she's exploring other methods, which might be possible. The husband is against it because he doesn't want a baby and is concerned about the child's well-being if his wife dies. He also mentions his own mental health struggles after her death.\n\nOn one hand, the husband's concerns are valid. He's thinking about the long-term impact on their child if the mother dies, and his own ability to care for a child while dealing with grief. He's seen his mother struggle with single parenting and anxiety, so he's afraid of repeating that. His father died when he was young, so he doesn't want his child to go through that.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife has a strong desire to be a mother, which is a significant part of her identity. Denying her that might be seen as selfish, especially if there's a way for her to become a mother without immediate risk. However, the husband is also making a selfless decision by prioritizing the child's future and his own mental health. He's trying to protect the potential child from a difficult upbringing and himself from further trauma.\n\nIs it selfish to deny your partner's wish if you don't want a child, even if it's for valid reasons? Or is it responsible to consider the long-term consequences? The key here is whether the husband is being selfish or self-aware. He's not being cruel; he's being honest about his feelings and limitations. The wife's desire is important, but the husband's rights and well-being matter too.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's making a decision that's in the best interest of both the potential child and himself, even if it goes against the wife's wishes, maybe he's not in the wrong. But if he's disregarding her deep emotional needs without considering alternatives, that could be problematic. However, he does express feeling terrible about it, showing empathy.\n\nI think the answer hinges on mutual understanding and communication. The husband is being honest about his stance, which is necessary. The wife might need to consider his perspective and the practical aspects, but the husband's decision isn't necessarily wrong. So, the answer might be B (he's not in the wrong) because he's making a responsible choice based on his circumstances.\n"
