I never wanted a baby. We are 24 and 25. She is very unwell, we dont know how long she has to live but most likely between 2 and 3 years.\n\nWhen she was diagnosed she was told having a baby would kill her, so the fact I don't want one wasn't an issue. Now she is looking into other methods that could work. \n\nThis woman was born to be a mother, and she would be the best darn mother in the world. I feel terrible denying her the opportunity to ever know what it's like to hold her own little bundle of joy. \n\nThat said, I think it's a bit unfair that she would like me to have a baby with her, take care of that baby, AND MY DYING WIFE. Just to have her die and leave me a 28 year old guy with a 3 year old baby I never wanted with a dead mother. \n\nMy father died when I was 3, I wouldn't wish it on anyone. I don't want that for my child. I watched my mother from an early age looking after me and my sister with no help from a partner, she still has crippling anxiety issues and it's effected her massively.\n\n I know what's ahead of me and it's going to be fucking rough. Is it selfish that I don't want to make it any harder than it has to be? \n\nI just want to go into a 6 month black hole of depression after she dies, I don't want to look after myself, certainly not a baby. \n\nAs you can probably tell by reading this, I can be a bit of a prick. But I don't think I'm being a prick right now. Let me know.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to have a baby with his terminally ill wife. The wife wants to be a mother but the husband doesn't. He's concerned about the child's well-being if the wife dies, and his own ability to care for them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider autonomy and consent. The husband doesn't want children, which is his right. But the wife's desire is also valid. However, the situation is complicated by her health. If having a baby would kill her, then there's a serious medical risk. Now she's exploring other methods, which might be less dangerous but still risky.\n\nThe husband's main argument is about the child's future. He doesn't want the child to grow up without a mother, as he experienced his father's death. He also mentions his mother's struggles, which adds to his fear. He feels it's unfair to burden himself with a child he doesn't want. There's also his mental health to consider\u2014after his wife's death, he expects depression and might not be able to care for a child.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's wish to be a mother is strong. She sees this as her last chance. But the husband's refusal isn't about not supporting her; he's prioritizing the potential child's well-being. It's a tough balance between respecting her wishes and protecting the child from a difficult upbringing.\n\nLegally, I think both have rights. The husband can't be forced to have a child against his will. Ethically, it's more nuanced. Is it selfish to prioritize not having a child? Or is it responsible to avoid creating a situation where the child might be without a parent? The husband's arguments about the child's future and his own ability to cope seem valid. He's not denying her the chance to be a mother out of selfishness, but because of realistic concerns.\n\nSo, in this case, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He's making a difficult decision based on his circumstances. The key is that he's not being forced and is considering the child's best interests. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
