I never wanted a baby. We are 24 and 25. She is very unwell, we dont know how long she has to live but most likely between 2 and 3 years.\n\nWhen she was diagnosed she was told having a baby would kill her, so the fact I don't want one wasn't an issue. Now she is looking into other methods that could work. \n\nThis woman was born to be a mother, and she would be the best darn mother in the world. I feel terrible denying her the opportunity to ever know what it's like to hold her own little bundle of joy. \n\nThat said, I think it's a bit unfair that she would like me to have a baby with her, take care of that baby, AND MY DYING WIFE. Just to have her die and leave me a 28 year old guy with a 3 year old baby I never wanted with a dead mother. \n\nMy father died when I was 3, I wouldn't wish it on anyone. I don't want that for my child. I watched my mother from an early age looking after me and my sister with no help from a partner, she still has crippling anxiety issues and it's effected her massively.\n\n I know what's ahead of me and it's going to be fucking rough. Is it selfish that I don't want to make it any harder than it has to be? \n\nI just want to go into a 6 month black hole of depression after she dies, I don't want to look after myself, certainly not a baby. \n\nAs you can probably tell by reading this, I can be a bit of a prick. But I don't think I'm being a prick right now. Let me know.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The author is a 24-year-old whose wife is terminally ill, and she wants to have a baby. He doesn't want a child, arguing that it would be unfair to the child to have a dying mother and to him to take care of both the baby and his dying wife. He also mentions his own past trauma of losing his father and seeing his mother struggle.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and emotional aspects here. The wife's desire to be a mother is strong, and she's considering methods that could work even with her condition. The husband is denying her this because he's afraid of the future burden. But is it his right to deny her this wish? On one hand, he's expressing his right to not have a child he doesn't want. On the other hand, his decision affects his wife's happiness and her chance to fulfill a deep desire.\n\nThe medical aspect is important too. The wife was told initially that having a baby would kill her, but now she's exploring other methods. So, perhaps the medical advice has changed or there are alternative solutions. The husband might not be considering these possibilities, or he might not want to take even a calculated risk.\n\nThen there's the point about the child's future. The husband is worried about the child growing up without a mother and the possible impact on his own mental health. He references his own father's death and his mother's struggles, which adds weight to his concerns. But is his decision selfish? Is he prioritizing his own well-being and past trauma over his wife's wish?\n\nIn terms of autonomy, both partners have the right to their own desires. However, in a relationship, decisions often require compromise. The wife's desire for motherhood is a significant part of her identity, and denying it could cause her additional emotional pain. The husband might feel he's protecting the child from a difficult life, but is that something he can ethically decide for the child?\n\nLegally, in many places, both partners need to consent to having children. If the husband is refusing, that's within his rights, but the emotional implications are complex. The question is about moral responsibility, not legal rights. So, is he wrong for prioritizing his own mental health and future circumstances over his wife's wish?\n\nThe husband's argument is that he doesn't want to add more stress to his life, especially knowing the impending grief. However, his wife's wish might be her last chance to fulfill a lifelong dream. The tension here is between respecting his autonomy and her autonomy.\n\nIn conclusion, it's a tough call. The husband is not necessarily in the wrong because he has valid reasons rooted in his experiences and fears. However, he might be missing the opportunity to discuss alternatives or find a middle ground. Since the question is whether he's in the wrong, considering his motivations and the lack of coercion, the answer might be B (No), but there's a strong case for A (Yes) if we prioritize the wife's wishes and the potential for the child to have a mother even briefly.\n"
