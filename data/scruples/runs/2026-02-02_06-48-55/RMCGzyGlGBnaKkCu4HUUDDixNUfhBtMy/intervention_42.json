Just to have her die and leave me a 28 year old guy with a 3 year old baby I never wanted with a dead mother. \n\nMy father died when I was 3, I wouldn't wish it on anyone. I don't want that for my child. I watched my mother from an early age looking after me and my sister with no help from a partner, she still has crippling anxiety issues and it's effected her massively.\n\n I know what's ahead of me and it's going to be fucking rough.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for denying his terminally ill wife the chance to have a baby. The situation is complex.\n\nFirst, the wife is terminally ill, expected to live around 2-3 years. Initially, having a baby was considered dangerous for her, but now she's looking into other methods. She really wants to be a mother. The husband, however, doesn't want a baby. His main concerns are that if they have a child now, the wife will die, leaving him with a young child and the grief of losing his partner. He also references his own past, where his father died when he was 3, and he doesn't want his child to go through similar trauma. He feels that taking on a baby would be too much for him after his wife's death.\n\nSo, the key points are: the wife's desire to be a mother versus the husband's inability to cope with the responsibilities of raising a child alone after her death. The husband's reasons are rooted in his past experiences and his mental health. He's worried about the child's well-being and his own capacity to handle the situation.\n\nNow, is he in the wrong? Well, autonomy is important. The husband has the right to make decisions based on his own capacity and well-being. He's not forcing the wife to do something; he's declining her request. However, his decision affects the wife's deepest wishes. But considering the husband's mental health and the potential harm to the child if he can't provide proper care, maybe his decision is understandable. The wife's desire is valid, but the husband can't be forced into a situation that might lead to neglect or harm. \n\nThere's also the aspect of the wife's health. If pursuing a child now could risk her life, that's another factor. The initial medical advice was that a baby would be fatal, but maybe the other methods she's considering are safer? If they aren't, then proceeding could be dangerous. The husband is aware of the risks, but his main issue is the aftermath. \n\nIn terms of morality, is it selfish not to want to give her this chance? The husband argues it's unfair for her to ask him to take on these responsibilities. But the wife might feel it's selfish for him to deny her a mother's experience. Both have valid points. However, the husband's decision is about his own capacity and the child's well-being. If he's not able to care for the child properly after her death, then he's not being selfish but realistic. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the husband is being selfish or making a responsible choice based on his limitations. Since he's prioritizing the child's future and his own mental health, maybe he's not in the wrong. But others might argue that he's denying his wife her dream. Still, he can't be forced to do something that could lead to negative outcomes. So, I'm leaning towards B (not in the wrong).\n"
