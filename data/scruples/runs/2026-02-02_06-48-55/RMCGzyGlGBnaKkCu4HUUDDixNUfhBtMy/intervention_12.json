I never wanted a baby. We are 24 and 25. She is very unwell, we dont know how long she has to live but most likely between 2 and 3 years.\n\nWhen she was diagnosed she was told having a baby would kill her, so the fact I don't want one wasn't an issue. Now she is looking into other methods that could work. \n\nThis woman was born to be a mother, and she would be the best darn mother in the world. I feel terrible denying her the opportunity to ever know what it's like to hold her own little bundle of joy. \n\nThat said, I think it's a bit unfair that she would like me to have a baby with her, take care of that baby, AND MY DYING WIFE. Just to have her die and leave me a 28 year old guy with a 3 year old baby I never wanted with a dead mother. \n\nMy father died when I was 3, I wouldn't wish it on anyone. I don't want that for my child. I watched my mother from an early age looking after me and my sister with no help from a partner, she still has crippling anxiety issues and it's effected her massively.\n\n I know what's ahead of me and it's going to be fucking rough. Is it selfish that I don't want to make it any harder than it has to be? \n\nI just want to go into a 6 month black hole of depression after she dies, I don't want to look after myself, certainly not a baby. \n\nAs you can probably tell by reading this, I can be a bit of a prick. But I don't think I'm being a prick right now. Let me know.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for denying his terminally ill wife the chance to be a mother. The situation is complex because it involves personal desires, health risks, and future implications.\n\nFirst, the wife is terminally ill with a life expectancy of 2-3 years. Initially, she couldn't have a baby because it would have been fatal, but now there are other options. She really wants to be a mother, so she's exploring these methods. The husband, however, doesn't want a child. He's worried about the future\u2014caring for a baby while his wife is dying, then being left with a young child after her death. He also has a personal history where his father died when he was young, making him empathetic to the trauma a child might face. He's afraid of ending up in a similar situation as his mother, who had to care for them alone and now has anxiety issues.\n\nThe husband is struggling with the idea of adding a child to his life, given the impending loss and the emotional toll. He feels it's selfish to agree, even though he acknowledges his wife's desire. He's conflicted between her wish and his own capacity to handle the future. He's asking if he's the asshole (AITA) for denying her this.\n\nNow, considering morality and ethics. Autonomy is a big factor here. Both partners have their own rights and desires. The wife's wish to fulfill her dream of motherhood is significant, but the husband's concerns about the child's well-being and his own capacity to care are valid. It's a balance between respecting her autonomy and his right to make decisions about their shared life and future.\n\nIs it selfish to prioritize his own emotional state and the child's future? Maybe. But is it wrong? It depends on perspective. The husband is making a difficult choice based on realistic expectations of what he can handle. The wife's desire is also valid, but so is the husband's right to his own limits. There's no clear right or wrong here. However, the husband's refusal isn't necessarily in the wrong because he's protecting his and the potential child's well-being. The key is whether he's being selfish without considering alternatives. But given the circumstances, his stance might be justified. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but I need to be careful here.\n"
