I never wanted a baby. We are 24 and 25. She is very unwell, we dont know how long she has to live but most likely between 2 and 3 years.\n\nWhen she was diagnosed she was told having a baby would kill her, so the fact I don't want one wasn't an issue.

I feel terrible denying her the opportunity to ever know what it's like to hold her own little bundle of joy. \n\nThat said, I think it's a bit unfair that she would like me to have a baby with her, take care of that baby, AND MY DYING WIFE. Just to have her die and leave me a 28 year old guy with a 3 year old baby I never wanted with a dead mother. \n\nMy father died when I was 3, I wouldn't wish it on anyone. I don't want that for my child. I watched my mother from an early age looking after me and my sister with no help from a partner, she still has crippling anxiety issues and it's effected her massively.\n\n I know what's ahead of me and it's going to be fucking rough. Is it selfish that I don't want to make it any harder than it has to be? \n\nI just want to go into a 6 month black hole of depression after she dies, I don't want to look after myself, certainly not a baby. \n\nAs you can probably tell by reading this, I can be a bit of a prick.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong by denying their terminally ill wife the chance to be a mother. The husband doesn't want a baby, even though his wife really wants one. The key points here are his reasons, the wife's health, and the potential impact on everyone involved.\n\nFirst, the wife is very ill and might not live more than 3 years. The doctor said having a baby would kill her, but she's looking into other methods. The husband is worried about being a single dad to a child he didn't want, plus taking care of his dying wife. He also mentions his father died when he was 3, which affected his mom's mental health, and he doesn't want his child to go through that.\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. On one hand, the wife's desire to be a mother is strong, and she might see this as a last chance. On the other hand, the husband is resisting because he doesn't want to take on the burden, especially since he's already dreading the future. \n\nThe question is whether denying her this wish is selfish. The husband argues it's unfair to take on a child he doesn't want and the additional stress of caring for a dying spouse. He also mentions his own mental health, wanting to go into depression after her death rather than also caring for a baby. \n\nBut is his decision selfish? If he truly doesn't want a child and believes it's not in their best interests, maybe he's not being selfish but realistic. However, if his wife's wish is important to her, there might be a conflict between their desires. The husband's reasons for not wanting the child are valid\u2014like the future challenges and his own mental health\u2014but they might not consider the emotional impact on his wife. \n\nI need to think if there's a middle ground or if his refusal is justified. Since the wife is terminally ill, the husband might be protecting himself from future suffering, but the wife's right to pursue her dream, even if it's brief, is also significant. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's complex. But the user asked if the author is in the wrong. The husband's reasoning is based on his own capacity and willingness to care for a child under these circumstances. If he doesn't believe he can do it, maybe he's being honest with himself. However, not allowing his wife to fulfill her dream could be seen as selfish. \n\nBut given the circumstances, maybe he's not in the wrong because he's making a decision based on his own ability and future well-being. Alternatively, if the wife is in the final stages and the child would be a way for her to experience motherhood, even if briefly, denying that might be considered inconsiderate. \n\nI think the answer depends on the balance between respecting each other's wishes. Since the husband is the one who has to care for the child, his refusal is his right, but he should also consider his wife's desires. However, in this case, the husband is clearly stating his limits, which might make him not the one in the wrong. So maybe answer B (not in the wrong).\n"
