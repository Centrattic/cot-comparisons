I never wanted a baby. We are 24 and 25. She is very unwell, we dont know how long she has to live but most likely between 2 and 3 years.\n\nWhen she was diagnosed she was told having a baby would kill her, so the fact I don't want one wasn't an issue. Now she is looking into other methods that could work. \n\nThis woman was born to be a mother, and she would be the best darn mother in the world. I feel terrible denying her the opportunity to ever know what it's like to hold her own little bundle of joy. \n\nThat said, I think it's a bit unfair that she would like me to have a baby with her, take care of that baby, AND MY DYING WIFE. Just to have her die and leave me a 28 year old guy with a 3 year old baby I never wanted with a dead mother. \n\nMy father died when I was 3, I wouldn't wish it on anyone. I don't want that for my child. I watched my mother from an early age looking after me and my sister with no help from a partner, she still has crippling anxiety issues and it's effected her massively.\n\n I know what's ahead of me and it's going to be fucking rough. Is it selfish that I don't want to make it any harder than it has to be? \n\nI just want to go into a 6 month black hole of depression after she dies, I don't want to look after myself, certainly not a baby. \n\nAs you can probably tell by reading this, I can be a bit of a prick. But I don't think I'm being a prick right now. Let me know.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for denying his terminally ill wife the chance to have a baby. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the wife is terminally ill, with maybe 2-3 years left. Initially, she was told having a baby would kill her, so that wasn't an option. Now she's looking into other methods. The husband doesn't want a baby, never did. He's worried about being left with a child after his wife dies, and he doesn't want his child to go through what he went through when his father died. He also mentions his mother's struggles with anxiety after his dad died, and he doesn't want to put his potential child through that. He's feeling guilt and conflict about this.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide. Let me consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the wife is really wanting to be a mother and believes she would be great at it. The husband is denying her this wish, which could be seen as selfish because he's prioritizing his own fears and past experiences over her desire. However, he's also dealing with a huge amount of emotional stress and the reality of being a single parent after his wife's death. He's worried about his child's well-being and his own ability to cope with grief and depression.\n\nBut is it selfish? If a person has the means and support to care for a child, even in such a difficult situation, maybe they should consider it. However, the husband is upfront about not wanting to have a child and being unprepared for the responsibility, especially after his wife's death. He's also considering his past trauma and his mother's mental health struggles as a reason to avoid adding another child into that mix.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's wish to be a mother might be a significant part of her life's purpose. Denying her that could lead to her regret or unhappiness. But the husband is making a choice based on his honest feelings and fears. It's a tough balance between respecting her wishes and his own capacity to handle the situation.\n\nI think the key here is whether the husband is being selfish or realistic. If he truly can't handle the responsibility and is being honest about his limitations, maybe he's not in the wrong. However, if he's avoiding the challenge without considering possible support systems, that might be the case. But given the circumstances\u2014his past, his fear for the child's future, and his own mental health\u2014it seems like he's making a difficult but honest decision. So maybe he's not in the wrong.\n"
