I never wanted a baby. We are 24 and 25.

Just to have her die and leave me a 28 year old guy with a 3 year old baby I never wanted with a dead mother. \n\nMy father died when I was 3, I wouldn't wish it on anyone. I don't want that for my child. I watched my mother from an early age looking after me and my sister with no help from a partner, she still has crippling anxiety issues and it's effected her massively.\n\n I know what's ahead of me and it's going to be fucking rough. Is it selfish that I don't want to make it any harder than it has to be? \n\nI just want to go into a 6 month black hole of depression after she dies, I don't want to look after myself, certainly not a baby. \n\nAs you can probably tell by reading this, I can be a bit of a prick.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for denying his terminally ill wife the chance to be a mother. The situation is pretty intense.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the details. The wife is terminally ill, with a life expectancy of 2-3 years. Initially, having a baby was not an option because it would be fatal. Now, she's exploring other methods, maybe surrogacy or something similar. The husband doesn't want a baby because he's worried about the burden after her death. He cites his own father dying when he was 3, leading to his mother's struggles. He doesn't want his child to go through that. Also, he mentions his mental health and not wanting to care for both a baby and his dying wife.\n\nThe key points here are consent, autonomy, and emotional impact. The husband is refusing to have a child despite his wife's strong desire. In most relationships, both partners need to agree on such a significant decision. The wife's health is a critical factor, but the husband's reasons are about his emotional well-being and the future of their child.\n\nBut is it his decision alone? Even if the wife can't have a baby in the traditional way, she might be considering alternatives. However, the husband's refusal is based on his own fears and past experiences. The question is whether his decision is selfish or reasonable. He's prioritizing his own mental health and not wanting to burden the child, but the wife's wish is to be a mother, which is a big part of her identity.\n\nIn ethical terms, respecting autonomy is important. The wife has the right to pursue her dream, but the husband has the right to refuse if he doesn't want a child. However, the husband is denying a significant wish of his partner, especially under such circumstances. The impact on the child is a concern, but the husband's decision is to not have a child at all, not to abandon it. The wife's potential death is a reality they both know, but the husband is trying to avoid the future pain.\n\nI'm leaning towards the husband not being in the wrong. He's making a decision based on his mental health and the child's well-being. However, it's a tough call because the wife's desire is also valid. But since he's upfront about his reasons and they are rooted in his own experiences and mental health, it's a personal choice that he's making. The key is mutual consent, and the husband isn't being coercive. So, maybe the answer is B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
