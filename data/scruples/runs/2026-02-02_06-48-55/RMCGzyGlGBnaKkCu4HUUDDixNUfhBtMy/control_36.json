      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a terminally ill wife wanting to have a child, but the husband doesn't want to. He's denying her this chance because he's worried about the future when she dies. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the wife is very ill, maybe 2-3 years left. They're both young, 24 and 25. The husband initially didn't want kids, and the wife was told that getting pregnant would kill her. Now, she's exploring other methods. He's feeling conflicted because he knows she wants to be a mother, but he's also scared of the burden after she's gone. He mentions his own father dying when he was 3, and seeing his mom struggle. He's worried that if they have a child, he'll be left alone with a kid and a dead wife, which he doesn't think he can handle emotionally or physically.\n\nSo the question is, is he in the wrong for not wanting to have the baby? Let me think about the ethical aspects here. On one hand, the wife's desire to be a mother is significant, and she might see this as her last chance. On the other hand, the husband is considering his own well-being and the child's. He doesn't want the child to go through losing a parent, similar to how he lost his father. Also, he's worried about his mother's mental health and how caring for a child alone might affect him.\n\nBut is it selfish? He argues it's not selfish, that he's being realistic. However, denying his wife's wish could be seen as prioritizing his own fears over her final desires. But he's also considering the child's future. Maybe others might see it as a shared decision, but the wife is pushing for it, and he's refusing. \n\nThe key points here are autonomy and shared decision-making in a marriage. The husband is making a choice based on his own capacity to handle the situation. But does he have the right to deny her wish without considering her perspective? Maybe the answer depends on whether they can find a middle ground, like surrogacy or adoption after her death, but the post doesn't mention that. \n\nAlso, the husband's mental health is a factor. If he's not in a place to care for a child, especially after her death, then maybe it's responsible to say no. But the wife's right to fulfill her desire to mother might be another angle. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the husband isn't obligated to have a child he doesn't want, especially under such dire circumstances. So maybe the answer is B, he's not in the wrong. But I need to make sure I'm not missing something. The wife's autonomy is important, but the husband's autonomy too. Since the wife's health is critical, and the husband's refusal is based on realistic concerns for the future, it's a tough call. But given that he's not forcing her to have a child, just not going along with her plan, maybe he's not in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
