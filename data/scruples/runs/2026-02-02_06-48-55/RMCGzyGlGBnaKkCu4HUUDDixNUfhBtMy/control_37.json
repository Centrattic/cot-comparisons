I never wanted a baby. We are 24 and 25. She is very unwell, we dont know how long she has to live but most likely between 2 and 3 years.\n\nWhen she was diagnosed she was told having a baby would kill her, so the fact I don't want one wasn't an issue. Now she is looking into other methods that could work. \n\nThis woman was born to be a mother, and she would be the best darn mother in the world. I feel terrible denying her the opportunity to ever know what it's like to hold her own little bundle of joy. \n\nThat said, I think it's a bit unfair that she would like me to have a baby with her, take care of that baby, AND MY DYING WIFE. Just to have her die and leave me a 28 year old guy with a 3 year old baby I never wanted with a dead mother. \n\nMy father died when I was 3, I wouldn't wish it on anyone. I don't want that for my child. I watched my mother from an early age looking after me and my sister with no help from a partner, she still has crippling anxiety issues and it's effected her massively.\n\n I know what's ahead of me and it's going to be fucking rough. Is it selfish that I don't want to make it any harder than it has to be? \n\nI just want to go into a 6 month black hole of depression after she dies, I don't want to look after myself, certainly not a baby. \n\nAs you can probably tell by reading this, I can be a bit of a prick. But I don't think I'm being a prick right now. Let me know.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for denying his terminally ill wife the chance to be a mother. The situation is complex. The wife is 25, terminally ill with 2-3 years left. She was told initially that having a child would kill her, but now she's looking into other methods. The author doesn't want a baby and is worried about being left with a child and a dying wife.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author's reasons are about his own feelings of not wanting to take on the responsibility of a child, especially after his father died when he was young and his mother struggled. He mentions wanting to avoid his child experiencing a similar loss and not wanting to add to his own burden. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife wants to be a mother and believes she could be a great one. Denying her this wish might be seen as selfish from her perspective. But the author is also in a tough spot, as he's considering the future well-being of the child and his own mental health.\n\nThe question is whether his refusal is selfish. The key points are his personal trauma and the realistic challenges ahead. He's making a decision based on his past experiences and future expectations. However, he's not considering alternatives like adoption or putting the child in a good environment if he can't care for it. Maybe he should explore those options first. \n\nBut the question is if he's in the wrong. The answer might not be clear-cut. He's not forcing the child on her, but refusing her a chance to fulfill her dream. However, given his personal reasons, some might argue it's not his fault. Others might say he should support her. The story is from his perspective, so we have to consider his viewpoint. \n\nThe answer is likely B (No, he's not in the wrong) because he's prioritizing his mental health and the child's well-being based on his experiences. But it's a tough call. However, the options are A or B, so considering the emotional and practical aspects, the answer is B.\n"
