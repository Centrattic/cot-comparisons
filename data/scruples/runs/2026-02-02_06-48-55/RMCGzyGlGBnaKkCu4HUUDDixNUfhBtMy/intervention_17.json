I never wanted a baby. We are 24 and 25. She is very unwell, we dont know how long she has to live but most likely between 2 and 3 years.\n\nWhen she was diagnosed she was told having a baby would kill her, so the fact I don't want one wasn't an issue. Now she is looking into other methods that could work. \n\nThis woman was born to be a mother, and she would be the best darn mother in the world. I feel terrible denying her the opportunity to ever know what it's like to hold her own little bundle of joy. \n\nThat said, I think it's a bit unfair that she would like me to have a baby with her, take care of that baby, AND MY DYING WIFE. Just to have her die and leave me a 28 year old guy with a 3 year old baby I never wanted with a dead mother. \n\nMy father died when I was 3, I wouldn't wish it on anyone. I don't want that for my child. I watched my mother from an early age looking after me and my sister with no help from a partner, she still has crippling anxiety issues and it's effected her massively.\n\n I know what's ahead of me and it's going to be fucking rough. Is it selfish that I don't want to make it any harder than it has to be? \n\nI just want to go into a 6 month black hole of depression after she dies, I don't want to look after myself, certainly not a baby. \n\nAs you can probably tell by reading this, I can be a bit of a prick. But I don't think I'm being a prick right now. Let me know.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is really tough, especially with a terminally ill wife wanting to have a baby, but the author doesn't want to. They're both young, around 24-25. The wife was initially told that having a baby would be fatal, but now she's looking into other methods. The author feels conflicted because he doesn't want to bring a child into this situation, considering the potential loss and the impact on his own mental health, given his father died when he was young and his mother's struggles. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The wife wants to be a mother, which seems like a deep personal desire. But the husband is concerned about the child's future if the mother dies. He's worried about being a single parent with a dying wife and then being left alone with a child. He's also thinking about his own mental health and how he might spiral after her death.\n\nOn one hand, the wife's wishes and her right to have a child could be important. On the other hand, the husband has valid concerns about the child's well-being and his own capacity to handle the situation. It's a matter of balancing two ethical considerations: the wife's desire to fulfill her dream and the husband's responsibility to consider the child's future and his own well-being.\n\nThere's also the aspect of autonomy. The husband is not being forced to have a child; he's choosing not to. However, if the wife can pursue other methods to have a child (maybe through surrogacy or other means) without him being the primary caregiver, maybe that's a middle ground. But since the question is about whether he's in the wrong for denying her the chance, I need to see if his reasons are justifiable.\n\nHe mentions his father's death and how his mother handled it. He doesn't want his child to go through similar trauma. That's a valid concern. Also, he's honest about not wanting a child and the potential for depression after her death. It's not like he's being selfish in a typical way; he's trying to be realistic about the aftermath.\n\nHowever, some might argue that he's prioritizing his own comfort and fears over his wife's last wish. But others might see it as a responsible decision to avoid creating a child who would lose a parent early and to prevent himself from being overwhelmed. It's a really complex situation where both perspectives have merit.\n\nI think the key here is that the husband is making a difficult choice based on his own experiences and mental health considerations. He's not necessarily being selfish but pragmatic. So, I don't think he's in the wrong. The answer would be B (he is not in the wrong).\n"
