I never wanted a baby. We are 24 and 25. She is very unwell, we dont know how long she has to live but most likely between 2 and 3 years.\n\nWhen she was diagnosed she was told having a baby would kill her, so the fact I don't want one wasn't an issue. Now she is looking into other methods that could work. \n\nThis woman was born to be a mother, and she would be the best darn mother in the world. I feel terrible denying her the opportunity to ever know what it's like to hold her own little bundle of joy. \n\nThat said, I think it's a bit unfair that she would like me to have a baby with her, take care of that baby, AND MY DYING WIFE. Just to have her die and leave me a 28 year old guy with a 3 year old baby I never wanted with a dead mother. \n\nMy father died when I was 3, I wouldn't wish it on anyone. I don't want that for my child. I watched my mother from an early age looking after me and my sister with no help from a partner, she still has crippling anxiety issues and it's effected her massively.\n\n I know what's ahead of me and it's going to be fucking rough. Is it selfish that I don't want to make it any harder than it has to be? \n\nI just want to go into a 6 month black hole of depression after she dies, I don't want to look after myself, certainly not a baby. \n\nAs you can probably tell by reading this, I can be a bit of a prick. But I don't think I'm being a prick right now. Let me know.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for denying his terminally ill wife the chance to be a mother. The situation is complex. The wife is very ill, likely to live 2-3 more years, and she's determined to be a mother. The husband doesn't want a child because he's worried about the child's future without her and his own ability to cope after her death.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The husband's decision is based on his own mental health and the child's well-being. He's considering the potential trauma of the child losing a mother and himself being overwhelmed. But at the same time, the wife has a strong desire to be a mother, which is a significant part of her identity. \n\nIs it selfish for him to deny her wish? On one hand, he's prioritizing the child's future and his own capacity to handle the situation. On the other hand, he's not allowing her to fulfill a lifelong dream, which could lead to her regret or unhappiness. \n\nThe key points here are autonomy and the impact on others. The husband has the right to make decisions about his own body and future, but there's also the consideration of his wife's wishes and the child's rights. However, since the methods she's looking into might be risky for her health, there's a medical aspect to consider as well. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the husband is concerned about being left with a child and a grieving sister-in-law. His past with his own father's death might be influencing his decision, making him empathetic to the child's potential trauma. \n\nBut is denying her the chance to be a mother his right? If the medical advice initially said having a baby would kill her, but now there are other options, maybe those are worth exploring. However, the husband's refusal might stem from genuine fear of what's ahead. \n\nThere's also the aspect of consent and shared decision-making in a marriage. Both partners should ideally agree on such a life-changing decision. The husband's refusal isn't just about his own feelings but also about the child's future. However, the wife's desire could be seen as a fundamental part of her identity, which complicates things.\n\nI think the husband's position isn't entirely in the wrong. He's making a difficult choice based on his own capacity and the child's well-being. However, there's a potential for him to be inconsiderate if he's not fully considering his wife's emotional needs and the medical possibilities. But given the circumstances, his decision is a matter of personal choice and protecting the child, which could be seen as responsible rather than selfish. So maybe the answer is B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
