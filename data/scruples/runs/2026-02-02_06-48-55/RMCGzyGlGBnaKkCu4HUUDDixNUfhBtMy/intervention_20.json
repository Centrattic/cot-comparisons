I never wanted a baby. We are 24 and 25. She is very unwell, we dont know how long she has to live but most likely between 2 and 3 years.\n\nWhen she was diagnosed she was told having a baby would kill her, so the fact I don't want one wasn't an issue. Now she is looking into other methods that could work. \n\nThis woman was born to be a mother, and she would be the best darn mother in the world. I feel terrible denying her the opportunity to ever know what it's like to hold her own little bundle of joy. \n\nThat said, I think it's a bit unfair that she would like me to have a baby with her, take care of that baby, AND MY DYING WIFE. Just to have her die and leave me a 28 year old guy with a 3 year old baby I never wanted with a dead mother. \n\nMy father died when I was 3, I wouldn't wish it on anyone. I don't want that for my child. I watched my mother from an early age looking after me and my sister with no help from a partner, she still has crippling anxiety issues and it's effected her massively.\n\n I know what's ahead of me and it's going to be fucking rough. Is it selfish that I don't want to make it any harder than it has to be? \n\nI just want to go into a 6 month black hole of depression after she dies, I don't want to look after myself, certainly not a baby. \n\nAs you can probably tell by reading this, I can be a bit of a prick.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a terminally ill wife who really wants to have a baby, but the husband doesn't want to. He's worried about raising the child alone after she dies and the emotional burden. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to figure out if that's the case.\n\nFirst, I should consider the key points. The wife is terminally ill, diagnosed with a condition that would kill her if she had a baby. Now she's looking into other methods. The husband doesn't want a baby because he doesn't want to go through raising a child alone after she's gone, especially since he experienced his father's death when he was young and saw the impact on his mom.\n\nThe husband is torn between his wife's desire to be a mother and his own fears. He feels selfish for not wanting to take on the responsibility, but he's also concerned about his mental health and the well-being of the child. The question is whether he's in the wrong for denying her this wish.\n\nI need to think about autonomy and consent in relationships. Both partners have the right to their own desires and boundaries. The husband is being honest about his feelings. But the wife's desire is strong, so is it wrong to deny her? However, he's not forcing her; he's just not willing to participate in a plan that he finds emotionally overwhelming. He's not taking away her choice entirely\u2014she's exploring other methods, which might include surrogacy or adoption, but he's not part of that. \n\nThe husband's reasons are rooted in his own experiences and mental health. He's not being cruel, but he's setting limits. In a healthy relationship, both partners should respect each other's boundaries. So maybe he's not in the wrong. On the other hand, some might argue that he's not supporting his wife's deepest wish, but he's also not obligated to make sacrifices that he's uncomfortable with. \n\nI think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. He's making a difficult choice based on his own circumstances and mental health, which is valid. The key is mutual respect in their decisions.\n"
