I never wanted a baby. We are 24 and 25. She is very unwell, we dont know how long she has to live but most likely between 2 and 3 years.\n\nWhen she was diagnosed she was told having a baby would kill her, so the fact I don't want one wasn't an issue. Now she is looking into other methods that could work. \n\nThis woman was born to be a mother, and she would be the best darn mother in the world. I feel terrible denying her the opportunity to ever know what it's like to hold her own little bundle of joy. \n\nThat said, I think it's a bit unfair that she would like me to have a baby with her, take care of that baby, AND MY DYING WIFE. Just to have her die and leave me a 28 year old guy with a 3 year old baby I never wanted with a dead mother. \n\nMy father died when I was 3, I wouldn't wish it on anyone. I don't want that for my child. I watched my mother from an early age looking after me and my sister with no help from a partner, she still has crippling anxiety issues and it's effected her massively.\n\n I know what's ahead of me and it's going to be fucking rough. Is it selfish that I don't want to make it any harder than it has to be? \n\nI just want to go into a 6 month black hole of depression after she dies, I don't want to look after myself, certainly not a baby. \n\nAs you can probably tell by reading this, I can be a bit of a prick. But I don't think I'm being a prick right now. Let me know.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for denying his terminally ill wife the chance to have a baby. The wife is very ill, with a life expectancy of 2-3 years. Initially, she was told that having a baby would kill her, so the author didn't have to worry about it. Now she's considering other methods.\n\nThe author is conflicted. He feels bad about not letting her experience motherhood, but he's also worried about the future. He doesn't want a baby himself and is concerned about being a single parent after his wife dies, especially since his own father died when he was young, and his mom had to raise him and his sister alone, which affected her mental health. He doesn't want his child to go through that. He admits he can be a bit of a prick but feels this is different.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? On one hand, the wife's desire to be a mother is strong, and she might not have much time left. On the other hand, the author is realistic about the challenges of raising a child alone after her death. He's not just being selfish; he's considering the child's well-being and his own mental health. The wife's medical condition is a major factor here\u2014if she's considering methods that don't immediately threaten her life, maybe there's a middle ground. But the initial medical advice was that pregnancy would be fatal, so maybe new methods are safer? The author is denying her because he doesn't want the baby, not because of medical reasons now. Is it his right to deny her this wish when she's already in a terminal situation? Or is he justified in not wanting to take on a responsibility he's not prepared for, especially knowing the potential outcomes?\n\nI think the key points are autonomy vs. well-being. The author has the right to make decisions about his own life, including not wanting to have a child. However, his wife's autonomy and her wish to be a mother might be at odds. But given the circumstances, he's trying to protect both himself and any potential child from hardship. It's a tough call. Some might argue that the wife should have the right to pursue motherhood if possible, while others would side with the author's practical concerns. Since the author is prioritizing his own ability to cope and the child's future stability, maybe he's not in the wrong. But it's a complex situation with no clear answer. The user said they think he's in the wrong, but maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
