I never wanted a baby. We are 24 and 25. She is very unwell, we dont know how long she has to live but most likely between 2 and 3 years.\n\nWhen she was diagnosed she was told having a baby would kill her, so the fact I don't want one wasn't an issue. Now she is looking into other methods that could work. \n\nThis woman was born to be a mother, and she would be the best darn mother in the world. I feel terrible denying her the opportunity to ever know what it's like to hold her own little bundle of joy. \n\nThat said, I think it's a bit unfair that she would like me to have a baby with her, take care of that baby, AND MY DYING WIFE. Just to have her die and leave me a 28 year old guy with a 3 year old baby I never wanted with a dead mother. \n\nMy father died when I was 3, I wouldn't wish it on anyone. I don't want that for my child. I watched my mother from an early age looking after me and my sister with no help from a partner, she still has crippling anxiety issues and it's effected her massively.\n\n I know what's ahead of me and it's going to be fucking rough. Is it selfish that I don't want to make it any harder than it has to be? \n\nI just want to go into a 6 month black hole of depression after she dies, I don't want to look after myself, certainly not a baby. \n\nAs you can probably tell by reading this, I can be a bit of a prick.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband denying his terminally ill wife the chance to have a baby. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The wife is very ill, with a life expectancy of 2-3 years. Initially, she couldn't have a baby because it would kill her, but now she's exploring other methods. She's really passionate about being a mother. The husband doesn't want a child and is worried about the future\u2014raising a child alone after she dies, plus the emotional trauma from his own past with his father's death.\n\nThe husband's reasoning is that he doesn't want to add more stress to his life. He's concerned about his mental health, the burden of caring for both a child and his dying wife, and he doesn't want his child to go through losing a parent. He also mentions his mother's struggles with anxiety and the impact on the family. He feels it's selfish of his wife to ask him to go through all that when he didn't want a baby in the first place.\n\nNow, considering ethics and relationships. In a committed marriage, both partners' wishes should be considered. The wife has a strong desire to fulfill her wish of motherhood, but the husband has valid concerns about his ability to cope. Autonomy is important\u2014both have the right to their own desires. However, the husband is being asked to commit to something he's against for the long term. \n\nMedical factors: The initial advice that pregnancy would kill her complicates things. If new methods are possible, that's a different scenario. But the husband is now refusing, so it's a conflict of their wishes.\n\nEmotional aspects: The husband has trauma from his father's death and his mother's struggles. He's worried about his mental health, which is a legitimate concern. The wife's desire is strong, but she might not live to see the child grow up, which would leave the husband in a difficult situation.\n\nIs the husband being selfish? It's a tough call. He's prioritizing his own mental health and well-being. On the other hand, he's denying his partner a significant wish. But he's not obligated to fulfill her desire if it goes against his own will and well-being. \n\nLegal and ethical standards: There's no legal obligation for either to have a child. In a marriage, both partners need to consent to major decisions like having children. Since the husband never wanted a baby, he's within his rights to refuse, even if it's difficult for the wife. \n\nThe key point is mutual consent and respecting each other's autonomy. The husband isn't the one who initially wanted the child against the wife's wishes. The wife is pushing for a child despite his objections. In such cases, the husband's refusal isn't necessarily wrong if it's based on his personal circumstances and well-being.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be that the husband isn't in the wrong because he's respecting his own boundaries and mental health, even if it's a hard decision for his wife.\n"
