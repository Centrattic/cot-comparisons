I never wanted a baby. We are 24 and 25. She is very unwell, we dont know how long she has to live but most likely between 2 and 3 years.\n\nWhen she was diagnosed she was told having a baby would kill her, so the fact I don't want one wasn't an issue. Now she is looking into other methods that could work. \n\nThis woman was born to be a mother, and she would be the best darn mother in the world. I feel terrible denying her the opportunity to ever know what it's like to hold her own little bundle of joy. \n\nThat said, I think it's a bit unfair that she would like me to have a baby with her, take care of that baby, AND MY DYING WIFE. Just to have her die and leave me a 28 year old guy with a 3 year old baby I never wanted with a dead mother. \n\nMy father died when I was 3, I wouldn't wish it on anyone. I don't want that for my child. I watched my mother from an early age looking after me and my sister with no help from a partner, she still has crippling anxiety issues and it's effected her massively.\n\n I know what's ahead of me and it's going to be fucking rough. Is it selfish that I don't want to make it any harder than it has to be? \n\nI just want to go into a 6 month black hole of depression after she dies, I don't want to look after myself, certainly not a baby. \n\nAs you can probably tell by reading this, I can be a bit of a prick. But I don't think I'm being a prick right now. Let me know.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for denying his terminally ill wife the chance to have a baby. The situation is complex. The wife wants to be a mother, but the husband doesn't. They are both young, in their early 20s, and the wife's life expectancy is 2-3 years. Initially, she was told having a baby would kill her, but now she's exploring other methods.\n\nThe husband's main arguments are that he doesn't want a baby, doesn't want to be in a situation where he has to care for a child and a dying wife, and doesn't want his child to go through losing a parent like he did. He's concerned about his mother's mental health after his father's death and doesn't want to put his future child through that. He also mentions not wanting to go through depression after his wife's death and not being able to care for himself, let alone a baby.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. The key points are autonomy, shared decision-making in a relationship, and the ethical implications of having a child in such circumstances. The wife's desire to be a mother is strong, but the husband has valid concerns about the future well-being of the child and himself. However, having a child in this situation could lead to significant emotional and practical challenges. The husband is not selfish, but he's prioritizing his ability to handle the future. \n\nIn many relationships, major decisions like having a child require mutual agreement. If the husband is not on board, he's right to voice his concerns. However, the wife's wish is also important. The question is whether denying her wish is wrong. It's a tough balance. The husband is considering the child's future and his own capacity to cope. He's not making the decision lightly and is acknowledging his own emotional state.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's right to motherhood is significant. But given the circumstances, forcing the husband into a situation he's not willing to handle could be unfair. The decision is between respecting the husband's autonomy and the wife's desire. Since the husband is the one who would have to care for the child, his refusal isn't necessarily wrong. It's about mutual agreement. So, the answer is B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
