However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario describes someone who met two gay individuals and found their frequent mention of their sexuality annoying. The person tried to subtly hint that they didn't want it mentioned so often, but when that didn't work, they expressed their views directly and were met with accusations of being homophobic. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The main issue here is the author's discomfort with others openly discussing their sexuality and their actions in response. The author claims they don't have an issue with gay people and just want them to keep it to themselves. However, the friends felt the author was being homophobic, even though the author said they accept others' sexuality.\n\nLegal and social perspectives come into play here. Legally, in many places, being gay is protected, and discrimination is not allowed. The author isn't necessarily violating any laws, but socially, there's a strong emphasis on acceptance and inclusion. The author's request that others not mention their sexuality could be seen as imposing personal boundaries, but if it's coming from a place of discomfort with LGBTQ+ issues, it could be perceived negatively.\n\nAnother angle is the right to self-expression. The friends might feel it's important to express their identity, and the author's pushback could be seen as dismissing that right. The author's frustration might stem from personal tolerance levels, but in a society that values open discussion of identity, especially in progressive circles, the author's stance might clash with others' expectations of support.\n\nAlso, the friends labeling the author as homophobic could be because the author's request to stop mentioning their sexuality might be interpreted as not accepting their identity. The author explicitly said they accept them, but the friends might see the frequent mentions as a way to show solidarity and openness, which the author's discomfort could undermine.\n\nIt's possible that the author is not malicious but has different social expectations. However, in many contexts, especially where inclusivity is prioritized, the author's behavior might be seen as lacking support for the LGBTQ+ community, even if they don't hold negative views. The line between personal space and supporting someone's identity can be thin here.\n\nI should also consider intent. The author claims no issue with being gay, just annoyance with constant mentions. However, the friends might perceive that as not accepting their whole identity, which is integral to them. The author's action of expressing that to the friends, despite their discomfort, might be seen as a breach of social norms that encourage supporting and celebrating diversity.\n\nIn summary, the author might be in the wrong because their actions, even if not malicious, conflict with the friends' need to express their identity openly. The friends' reaction could be justified as they might feel their identity is being downplayed or ignored, which is a form of microaggression or subtle discrimination, even if the author isn't overtly bigoted.\n"
