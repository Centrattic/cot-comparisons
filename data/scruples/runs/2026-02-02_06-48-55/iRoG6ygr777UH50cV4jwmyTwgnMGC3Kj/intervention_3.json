However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them. (Even though I /clearly/ said I do accept them for their sexuality. I would just appreciate it if they didn't annoyingly mention it ever few minutes! Am I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not caring much about gay pride and finding it annoying when two gay friends they met constantly mention their sexuality. The author tried to hint that it's too much, then directly told them their views, and got called homophobic. They\u2019re asking if they\u2019re the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author says they don't have an issue with gay people but don't support gay pride and just want to keep their sexuality out of their presence. The friends are openly gay, which the author finds overbearing. The author tried to subtly let them know but then was more direct. They were labeled as homophobic even though they claimed to accept them. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, everyone has the right to express their identity. If the friends are openly discussing their sexuality, it's part of who they are. The author's discomfort might stem from personal boundaries, but it's important to consider if the friends were being overly explicit in every conversation. However, the author's approach in trying to hint and then directly stating their discomfort might come off as dismissive or judgmental, even if they don't have ill intent. \n\nSaying \"I don't support them\" could be problematic because it's about not supporting the community, not necessarily being against the people. But the friends might feel that their identity is being downplayed or that the author isn't accepting, which could lead to feeling unwelcome. The author's main issue is not with the friends themselves but with how they express their sexuality. However, people have the right to discuss their identity, and it's not on others to suppress that unless it's causing harm. \n\nThe author's frustration here might be valid if the friends were indeed overdoing it, but the way they addressed it\u2014by stating their beliefs and getting defensive\u2014could have been counterproductive. It's possible the friends felt their authenticity was under attack, leading to the negative reaction. The author might be in the wrong if their approach was not respectful or if they made the friends feel like they need to hide their identity. But if the friends were indeed being excessive, maybe the author's reaction is understandable, though poorly handled. However, the key point is that the friends have the right to be themselves, and the author's reaction might be projecting their own discomfort, which is where the issue lies. So likely, the author is in the wrong for not accepting that their friends have the right to express their sexuality, even if it's uncomfortable for the author.\n"
