However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them. (Even though I /clearly/ said I do accept them for their sexuality. I would just appreciate it if they didn't annoyingly mention it ever few minutes! Am I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The author claims they don't have a problem with gay people but find it annoying when people they know mention their sexuality frequently. They tried subtly hinting and then directly stating their discomfort, leading to being called homophobic.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social context. In many societies, it's important to respect people's identities and not make assumptions. The author's friends are openly discussing their sexuality, which is their right. The author's issue isn't with being gay but with the frequency of mentions. However, expecting others to hide an essential part of their identity just because someone else finds it uncomfortable could be seen as invalidating. The author might be projecting their discomfort onto the friends' actions. Also, by stating they don't support being gay but accept it, there's a nuance here that might not be well-received. The friends interpreted their comments as homophobic, which suggests a communication breakdown. The author's approach might have been too direct without considering how it's perceived. So, the answer is likely A (yes, in the wrong) because the author's discomfort doesn't justify demanding others to hide their identity, and their communication approach may have been insensitive.\n"
