However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them. (Even though I /clearly/ said I do accept them for their sexuality. I would just appreciate it if they didn't annoyingly mention it ever few minutes! Am I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong. The person is saying they don't have a problem with gay people but are uncomfortable with their friends constantly mentioning their sexuality. They tried to hint and then openly express their discomfort, leading to being called homophobic.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The person states they accept others regardless of their sexuality but find the constant references annoying. The friends are making it \"painfully obvious\" they're gay in every conversation. The author's main issue is that the friends are bringing it up too much, not with their sexuality itself.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a social perspective, it's important to respect people's identities. However, the author isn't opposing their sexuality but is bothered by the frequency of mentions. Legally and ethically, discrimination based on sexuality is wrong, but this is about personal discomfort, not discrimination. \n\nBut here's the catch: if the friends are sharing their identity as part of who they are, the author's request to stop might be seen as dismissing their identity. However, the author is not refusing to associate but is uncomfortable with the constant references. The friends' response of calling them homophobic might be an overreaction if the author didn't express disapproval of their sexuality, just the frequency of mention.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, people have the right to express their identity, even if others find it annoying. The author's issue isn't with the friends' sexuality but the frequency. But pushing back against someone's identity, even indirectly, can be seen as problematic. However, the author is not denying their friends' identity but is asking for personal space in conversation. \n\nI think the line is blurry. The author isn't discriminatory but is expressing a personal boundary. However, the friends feel their identity is being minimized. The key is that the author is allowing their discomfort to affect their interactions, which might be seen as not fully accepting their friends as they are. So, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because they're prioritizing their comfort over respecting their friends' need to express their identity openly.\n"
