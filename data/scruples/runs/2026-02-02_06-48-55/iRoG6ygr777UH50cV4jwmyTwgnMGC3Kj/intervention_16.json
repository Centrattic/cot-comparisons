However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them. (Even though I /clearly/ said I do accept them for their sexuality. I would just appreciate it if they didn't annoyingly mention it ever few minutes! Am I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're the asshole for not caring about gay pride and getting annoyed by their friends mentioning their sexuality a lot.\n\nFirst, the author meets two gay people and initially likes them. But then they start feeling uncomfortable because the friends mention being gay often. The author says they don't have a problem with being gay but don't want to be involved in their activism. They tried hinting and then directly stating their feelings, which led the friends to call them homophobic.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author isn't opposing LGBTQ+ rights but is bothered by the constant mention of their sexuality. The friends felt the author was being intolerant. The author claims to accept them but wants it to be a non-issue. \n\nNow, societal norms usually encourage respecting people's identities without forcing them to engage in activism. However, if someone feels their identity is being used to alienate them, that's a problem. The author's issue isn't with the friends being gay but with how they discuss it. The friends might feel their identity is central to who they are, so the author's pushback could be seen as invalidating that aspect.\n\nAlso, the author tried to communicate their discomfort, but the friends took it as rejection. There's a line between expressing personal boundaries and being discriminatory. The author isn't denying the friends' existence or rights, just their desire to avoid the topic. However, in many contexts, respecting someone's identity includes acknowledging it if they choose to express it. So, the author might be in the wrong for not accepting a part of their friends' identity that they feel is important to share.\n"
