However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author met two gay people and found their frequent mention of their sexuality annoying. The author tried to hint and then openly told them to stop, leading to being called homophobic.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author says they don't have a problem with gay people but get uncomfortable when their sexuality is mentioned constantly. They tried to address it but were met with accusations of being homophobic.\n\nFrom a social perspective, it's important to distinguish between disliking a behavior versus the person. The author isn't opposing the people's sexuality but is bothered by the frequency of their references. However, the way they addressed it might have come off as dismissive or judgmental. Even if the author clearly stated acceptance, the act of telling someone to stop expressing their identity can be seen as invalidating. \n\nHomosexual individuals often face societal pressures to \"come out\" or assert their identity, so constant mentions might be a way for them to feel affirmed. The author's discomfort in this situation could stem from a lack of understanding or empathy. The author's approach\u2014subtle hints followed by direct confrontation\u2014might not be the best way to handle differing social dynamics. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's frustration is understandable if they feel overwhelmed by the constant references. However, the right to self-expression is a key part of personal identity. The author's request to \"keep it out of it\" might be crossing into a place where they're imposing their own comfort on others' self-expression.\n\nAlso, the accusation of homophobia is a serious one. Even if the author didn't intend to be, the act of asking someone to downplay their identity could be perceived as wanting to suppress their true self. This is a sensitive area because it's about personal identity and acceptance.\n\nIn terms of social norms, it's generally expected to respect others' identities and expressions unless they are directly harmful. The author might not be in the wrong in terms of their feelings, but the way they handled the situation could be problematic. The key is whether the author's actions were a legitimate expression of their discomfort or an attempt to minimize others' identities.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author's actions were a harmless expression of personal preference or a harmful attempt to invalidate others' identities. Given that the author did say they accept the people's sexuality, but the manner of addressing the issue led to conflict, it's possible the author is in the wrong because they didn't respect the other's need to express their identity openly.\n"
