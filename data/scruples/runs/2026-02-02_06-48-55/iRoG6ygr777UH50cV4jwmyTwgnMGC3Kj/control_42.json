However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them. (Even though I /clearly/ said I do accept them for their sexuality. I would just appreciate it if they didn't annoyingly mention it ever few minutes!

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're the asshole for not caring about gay pride and being annoyed when their friends mention their sexuality too much. They met two gay people, initially liked them, but then started disliking them because they kept bringing up being gay. They tried to hint and then openly said they wanted them to stop mentioning it so much. They were called homophobic even though they said they don't have an issue with gay people.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author is wrong. The friends in question are openly discussing their identity. The author isn't opposed to being gay, just the frequency of the mentions. But people often express their identity, especially if they feel they need to in certain contexts. The author's discomfort might stem from not wanting to focus on it, but the friends might feel the need to be out and proud. The author's request to stop mentioning it could be seen as invalidating their identity, even if the author's intention is to avoid the topic. \n\nAlso, the friends might have felt that the author was uncomfortable with their presence and thus called them out as homophobic. The author did say they accept them but wants them to stop mentioning it. However, the right to express one's identity isn't something others can control. The author's request is about the behavior of the friends, not their identity. But in doing so, the author might be infringing on the friends' right to express themselves, especially if they're in an environment where they feel safe to do so. \n\nThe key points are: the author isn't against being gay but is against the frequency of mentions. The friends might see this as not accepting their identity, even if the author says they do. The line between personal discomfort and respecting someone's identity is thin here. The author's approach, especially after subtlety failed, might have been too direct, leading to conflict. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's stance isn't based on hatred but on personal preference. However, the friends have the right to express themselves, and the author's request to limit that expression could be seen as wrong. The author's actions, while not malicious, might have been inconsiderate of the friends' needs. So, the author is in the wrong because they're asking others to hide their identity for the author's comfort, which isn't acceptable. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
