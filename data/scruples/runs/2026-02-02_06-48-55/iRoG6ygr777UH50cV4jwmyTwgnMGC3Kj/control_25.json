However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them. (Even though I /clearly/ said I do accept them for their sexuality. I would just appreciate it if they didn't annoyingly mention it ever few minutes! Am I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking if someone who doesn't care about gay pride and finds it uncomfortable when people mention their sexuality is the asshole.\n\nFirst, the author says they don't have an issue with gay people but get annoyed when they mention their sexuality too often. They tried to hint it was too much, then directly told them their beliefs, and got called homophobic. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nSo, the key points here are about respecting people's identities and boundaries. When someone's identity is a significant part of who they are, it's part of their self-expression. If the author is uncomfortable with how often they mention being gay, that's their feeling, but it's important to consider if the friends were being overbearing or if the author's reaction is valid.\n\nHowever, the author did say they accept them for their sexuality, just don't want it mentioned so much. The friends might feel that their identity is important to them and should be shared. The author's approach of hinting and then directly stating their beliefs might have come off as dismissive or invalidating, even if they meant well. \n\nAlso, being called homophobic could be because the friends felt their identity was being minimized. Even if the author isn't intentionally discriminatory, their discomfort and the way they communicated it might have crossed a line. \n\nIn terms of social norms, it's generally accepted that people should feel comfortable expressing their identity. If the author is uncomfortable with that expression, they might need to adjust their own boundaries rather than expecting others to change how they present themselves. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because they're asking others to suppress a part of their identity for the author's comfort, which can be seen as disrespectful. The friends' reaction, while maybe harsh, stems from feeling that their identity is being rejected, even if the author isn't outright discriminatory.\n"
