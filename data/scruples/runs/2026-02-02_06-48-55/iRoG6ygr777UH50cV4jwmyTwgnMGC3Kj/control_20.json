I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them.

After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me read through the scenario again.\n\nSo the author met two gay people and initially liked them. But then they started to dislike them because the individuals were very vocal about their sexuality, mentioning it in almost every sentence. The author says they have no issue with gay people but don't support gay pride. They tried to hint that the constant mentions were annoying, then stated their beliefs and were called homophobic. The author is asking if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's main issue is with the frequency of the other people bringing up their sexuality, not with their identity itself. They claim they are accepting but just want them to keep it to themselves. The other people felt the author was being homophobic despite the author saying they accept them.\n\nFrom a social justice perspective, it's important to recognize that people have the right to express their identity. If someone is openly gay and mentions their sexuality, it's part of their identity. The author is uncomfortable with the frequency but isn't opposing their identity. However, the problem arises when the author's discomfort leads them to request the others to hide their identity, which could be seen as invalidating. Even if the author's intention is not to be discriminatory, making someone feel they have to downplay their identity can be harmful. Additionally, the author's statement about not supporting gay pride might imply a lack of acceptance beyond just tolerance. \n\nAlso, the friends' reaction (calling the author homophobic) suggests that their actions made the friends feel unaccepted. The author's insistence on the others not mentioning their sexuality so often could be seen as expecting them to be closeted, which is a form of microaggression. Even if the author doesn't have ill intentions, the impact on the friends is negative. \n\nOn the other hand, the author claims they have no issue with being gay, just the constant mentions. But in reality, when someone constantly brings up their identity, it might indicate that they feel the need to assert it, perhaps due to societal pressures or personal experiences. The author's request to stop might not consider the other person's need to express their identity freely. \n\nIn terms of social norms, respect for others' identities is key. The author is in a position where they want others to accept them as they are, but they are not extending the same courtesy. The friends are being themselves, and the author is uncomfortable with that. The author's approach of trying to change the friends' behavior is problematic because it's about their own discomfort rather than the friends' actions being inherently wrong.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because they are asking others to hide their identity to avoid their own discomfort, which can be seen as a form of discrimination, even if unintentional. Therefore, the answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
