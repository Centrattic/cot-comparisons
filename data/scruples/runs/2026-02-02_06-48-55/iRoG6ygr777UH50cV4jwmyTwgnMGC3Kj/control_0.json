However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not caring about gay pride and being uncomfortable with two gay friends who constantly mention their sexuality.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author says they don't have an issue with gay people but find it annoying when their friends repeatedly mention their sexuality. The friends took offense when the author tried to hint and then directly express their discomfort, leading to accusations of homophobia.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The possible answers are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nLet me break it down. The author's friends are openly discussing their identities, which is a normal part of their lives. The author's discomfort could stem from personal preference, but the friends might feel that the author is not accepting or is uncomfortable with their identity, even if the author denies it. \n\nThe author tried to hint and then directly tell their friends, which led to conflict. The friends felt resentful and called the author homophobic. The author claims they accept them as people but just don't want the constant references. \n\nFrom a social perspective, respecting someone's identity is important. If someone is open about their sexuality, it's part of their identity, and others might naturally discuss it. The author's issue is with the frequency, not the sexuality itself. However, the friends might feel that the author is not fully accepting or is uncomfortable with their true selves, even if the author says otherwise. \n\nThe author's actions\u2014hinting and then being direct\u2014might be seen as invalidating the friends' need to express their identity. The friends might feel that the author is policing their behavior. Even if the author's intention was to reduce the frequency, the friends perceived it as rejection. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author isn't being openly hostile, but they might be in the wrong for trying to limit the friends' expression of their identity. The friends have the right to discuss their sexuality as part of who they are. The author's discomfort doesn't justify pressuring them to be less open. \n\nSo, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because they tried to change their friends' behavior regarding their identity, which is a personal right. The friends' reactions are valid as they felt their identity was being rejected, even if unintentionally."
