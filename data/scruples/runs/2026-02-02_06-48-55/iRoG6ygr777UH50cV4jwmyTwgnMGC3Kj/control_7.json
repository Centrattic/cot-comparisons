However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them. (Even though I /clearly/ said I do accept them for their sexuality. I would just appreciate it if they didn't annoyingly mention it ever few minutes! Am I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not caring about gay pride and being uncomfortable with two gay people constantly mentioning their sexuality.\n\nFirst, the author states they have no issue with gay people but find it annoying when their friends make it a big deal. They tried to subtly hint that the friends were bringing it up too much, then directly told them their beliefs, leading to being called homophobic. The key points here are the author's acceptance of gay people versus their discomfort with the frequency of mentions.\n\nNow, considering the context: the author's friends are openly discussing their sexuality frequently. The author's problem isn't with their sexuality but with the constant references. They don't reject the friends but find the repetition uncomfortable. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author is expressing a personal preference. However, in modern society, it's important to recognize that people may discuss aspects of their identity to express pride or share experiences. The friends might see their openness as a way to be authentic. The author's reaction could be seen as dismissive of that expression, even if they don't harbor ill will. \n\nThe friends might feel invalidated if their way of being themselves is downplayed. The author's stance that they just want to be left alone could conflict with the friends' need to express their identity. The key is whether the author's disapproval crosses into being disrespectful. The answer hinges on whether the author's actions, even if not overtly hostile, contribute to a hostile environment for the friends' self-expression.\n\nGiven that the author explicitly states acceptance but is resistant to the expression of identity, the issue is more about personal boundaries versus respecting others' self-expression. The author isn't in the wrong for having preferences, but their reaction might be seen as inconsiderate. However, the friends' response of calling them homophobic might be an overreaction if the author isn't actually discriminatory. \n\nBut in terms of social norms, it's generally expected to respect others' identity expressions without making them feel they need to hide. The author's discomfort with the frequency might be a personal issue, but they are not wrong for not wanting to engage in topics they find uncomfortable, as long as they don't impose that on others. However, the friends' need to express their identity is valid, so the author's approach might be inconsiderate but not outright wrong. \n\nThe line is thin here. If the author is actively rejecting the friends for being gay, that's wrong. But here, they're just not interested in the topic. The friends might feel pressured to downplay their identity, which isn't fair. But the author's stance is more about personal boundaries. So, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong but could be seen as not fully respecting the friends' need to express their identity, but not in a malicious way.\n"
