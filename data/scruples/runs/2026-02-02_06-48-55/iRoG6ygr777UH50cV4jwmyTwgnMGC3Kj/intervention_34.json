However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them. (Even though I /clearly/ said I do accept them for their sexuality. I would just appreciate it if they didn't annoyingly mention it ever few minutes! Am I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about someone who doesn't like how often their friends mention being gay and feels uncomfortable. The author says they don't have an issue with being gay but don't support gay pride. They tried to hint their friends to stop mentioning it so much and then got called homophobic.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's problem isn't with the friends being gay but with them mentioning it too often. They tried to subtly hint at it but when that didn't work, they expressed their beliefs, which led to being labeled as homophobic. The friends took offense even though the author claims they accept them.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is wrong. From a social standpoint, respect for others' identities is important. If the friends are bringing up their sexuality in their own conversations, the author might be trying to control that aspect of their interactions. However, the friends might feel that their identity is being dismissed or that their need to express it is being minimized.\n\nThe author's stance is that they just don't want to hear about it, but the friends might see that as a rejection of their identity. Even if the author is not actively opposed to LGBTQ+ rights, the way they are reacting could be seen as insensitive. The friends might feel that the author is not fully accepting them, hence the label of homophobic.\n\nLegally and ethically, discrimination based on sexual orientation is wrong, but this is more about personal interactions. The author might believe they're being respectful, but the friends' reaction shows that the author's approach is causing hurt. The line between personal boundaries and respecting others' expression is thin here.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's issue isn't with the gay identity itself but with the frequency of the mentions. However, the friends might feel that the author is not accepting their identity in general. The author's attempts to reduce the mentions could be seen as invalidating the friends' experiences. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they are trying to police how their friends express their identity, even if they claim to accept them.\n"
