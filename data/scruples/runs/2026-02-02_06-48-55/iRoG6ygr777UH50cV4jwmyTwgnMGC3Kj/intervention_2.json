However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them. (Even though I /clearly/ said I do accept them for their sexuality. I would just appreciate it if they didn't annoyingly mention it ever few minutes! Am I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author met two gay individuals who kept mentioning their sexuality, making the author uncomfortable. The author tried to hint and then directly expressed their discomfort, leading to being called homophobic. The user thinks the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author states they don't have an issue with gay people but find the constant mention of being gay annoying. They tried to subtly hint and then directly tell them to stop, which led to conflict. The friends called them homophobic despite the author saying they accept them.\n\nFrom a social perspective, it's important to consider that people may express their identity in ways that are personal to them. If someone feels that their identity is being overemphasized, it might stem from personal discomfort rather than the other person's behavior. However, the author's directness in expressing this could be seen as dismissive or invalidating, even if their intention wasn't to be discriminatory. The friends' reaction suggests that the author's statements were perceived as offensive or harmful, regardless of intent. \n\nLegally and morally, discrimination based on sexuality is wrong, but this isn't about discrimination\u2014it's about personal boundaries. However, the author's approach might have crossed a line by making the friends feel their identity was being criticized. The key is whether the author's actions were disrespectful. While the author claims acceptance, focusing on the frequency of mentions can be seen as undermining the importance of the friends' identity. \n\nIn terms of social norms, it's common to respect others' self-expression unless it's causing harm. The author's discomfort doesn't justify making others feel they need to suppress their identity. The friends' reaction might be a response to feeling that their identity is being minimized. So, the author may be in the wrong for not respecting their friends' need to express their sexuality, even if they have no issue with being gay.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because their actions, despite their intentions, led to a conflict and could be seen as invalidating the friends' identity.\n"
