However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them. (Even though I /clearly/ said I do accept them for their sexuality. I would just appreciate it if they didn't annoyingly mention it ever few minutes! Am I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of an \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for not caring about gay pride and being annoyed by their friends constantly mentioning their sexuality.\n\nFirst, the author says they don't have an issue with gay people but feel uncomfortable when their friends make their sexuality a big part of every conversation. They tried hinting and then directly expressing their feelings, which led to being called homophobic. The key here is whether the author is wrong for not wanting others to highlight their sexuality in every interaction.\n\nI need to consider the context. The friends are openly discussing their identity, which is their right. The author's issue isn't with the people's sexuality but the frequency of mentioning it. However, the author's stance is that they don't support gay pride but just want to be left alone. The friends might feel their identity is being invalidated if others are uncomfortable with its mention.\n\nLegally, there's no issue with being gay, and people can express their identity freely. The author's problem is more about personal discomfort rather than a moral stance. The friends felt disrespected when the author expressed their discomfort, leading to conflict. The author's message seems to be that they don't want others to be openly gay around them, which could be seen as expecting others to downplay their identity to make the author comfortable. That's where the potential wrongdoing comes in\u2014expecting others to hide their identity for the sake of the author's comfort. \n\nAlso, the author claims not to be homophobic but then demands others not to mention their sexuality. This might not align because true acceptance includes respecting someone's identity, even if they choose to express it openly. The friends might feel that the author is, in fact, being judgmental by not accepting their expression of identity. The line between personal boundaries and discrimination is thin here. \n\nIn many cases, if someone is being respectful and not imposing their views, their right to express their identity should be upheld. The author's actions led to conflict because they didn't respect their friends' need to express their identity, despite the friends' discomfort. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they are asking others to suppress a fundamental part of their identity to accommodate their personal discomfort, which isn't fair or acceptable.\n"
