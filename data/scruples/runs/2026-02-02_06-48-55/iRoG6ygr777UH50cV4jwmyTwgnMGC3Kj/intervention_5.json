However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about the author not caring about gay pride and becoming uncomfortable when two gay friends mention their sexuality frequently. The author tried to hint and then directly told them to stop, but was accused of being homophobic.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author says they don't have an issue with gay people but finds it annoying when they mention being gay too much. They tried to address it first subtly, then directly. The friends took offense, calling them homophobic despite the author's clear statement of acceptance.\n\nNow, thinking about societal norms and respect. People often express their identity as part of their self-expression. If someone is repeatedly bringing up their sexuality, it's their way of being open and authentic. However, the author's discomfort leads them to ask the friends to stop. Is that reasonable?\n\nOn one hand, everyone has the right to express their identity. On the other hand, the author is not against gay people, just the frequency of the mentions. But the friends might feel that their identity is being dismissed or that the author is uncomfortable with their openness.\n\nThe author's actions: first subtle hints, then direct communication. The friends' reaction implies that they feel their identity is central to who they are, and being asked to tone it down could be seen as invalidating. The author claims to accept them, but the friends might perceive the behavior as rejecting their identity.\n\nIn terms of social responsibility, it's important to respect others' self-expression unless it's harmful. Constantly mentioning one's identity isn't inherently harmful, even if it's a personal annoyance. The author's approach might have been seen as dismissive of the friends' need to express their identity, which could be considered disrespectful.\n\nAlso, the concept of \"keep me out of it\" might imply the author wants distance from the friends' identity, which could be seen as a lack of acceptance. Even if the author isn't hostile, the request to stop mentioning their sexuality could be perceived as wanting them to hide that part of themselves, which is a form of microaggression.\n\nTherefore, the author's actions, while perhaps not malicious, could be seen as invalidating the friends' identity. The friends' reaction might be justified as feeling targeted, even if the author intended to be polite. So, the author is likely in the wrong here.\n"
