However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the \"AITA\" scenario is in the wrong for not caring about gay pride and being annoyed by others being openly gay. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author met two gay individuals and started to dislike them because they made their sexuality too obvious, mentioning it in almost every sentence. The author tried to hint and then directly tell them to stop, but was called homophobic despite saying they accept them. \n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author is wrong for wanting others to not mention their sexuality so frequently. From a social justice perspective, it's important to note that being LGBTQ+ is a personal identity, and individuals have the right to express it. The author's discomfort isn't due to the people's orientation but their insistence on mentioning it. However, the author's actions\u2014both subtle and direct\u2014amounted to requesting others to hide their identity, which some might see as a form of discrimination or microaggression.\n\nIn many cultures, especially in Western contexts, there's a strong emphasis on the right to self-expression and authenticity. Telling someone to stop being open about their identity, even if it's annoying, could be seen as invalidating their experience. The author claims to accept them but is bothered by the frequency of mentions. This might be a case of wanting people to be themselves but not having to engage with it, which can be seen as conflicting.\n\nAlso, the backlash from the other individuals\u2014being called homophobic\u2014might stem from feeling that their identity is being made a problem. Even if the author's intent was to reduce discomfort, the message received could be that the author is uncomfortable with their sexuality. This is a common misunderstanding in discussions about diversity and inclusion. The key here is that acceptance means respecting someone's identity, even if it's not something the other person is interested in engaging with beyond that. However, it's also about boundaries. People can have different comfort levels, but the line is crossed when it's about the person's inherent identity versus how it's expressed.\n\nIn terms of social norms, it's generally accepted that individuals should be allowed to express their identity without fear of judgment. The author's request might be seen as a form of \"microaggression,\" even if not intended. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong because they are asking others to suppress a part of their identity for the author's comfort, which isn't acceptable. So the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
