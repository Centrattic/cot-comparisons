However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them. (Even though I /clearly/ said I do accept them for their sexuality. I would just appreciate it if they didn't annoyingly mention it ever few minutes! Am I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not caring about gay pride and being annoyed by two gay friends constantly mentioning their sexuality.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author says they don't have an issue with gay people but are uncomfortable with the constant emphasis on their sexuality. They tried to subtly hint that it's too much, then directly told them their views, which led to being called homophobic. The author is asking if they're the asshole for not wanting to talk about it so much.\n\nHmm, from a social justice perspective, it's important to consider the experience of LGBTQ+ individuals. Many people in the community face discrimination and may feel the need to assert their identity, especially in spaces where they might not feel safe. The author's discomfort with the frequency might be valid, but the way they addressed it could be problematic. \n\nThe friends might have felt that the author's comments were invalidating their experience. Even if the author said they accept them, the act of complaining about the constant mention of their sexuality could be seen as dismissive. The friends might have felt that their identity is a significant part of who they are, and the author's request to not mention it is a form of erasure.\n\nAlso, the author's approach of \"subtly hinting\" and then stating their beliefs might not be the best way to communicate. It's possible that the friends felt attacked, leading to the accusation of being homophobic. The key here is intent vs. impact. Even if the author's intent was not to be offensive, the impact of their words could have been hurtful.\n\nI should also consider cultural context. In many places, being open about one's sexuality is a form of self-acceptance and a response to societal pressures. The author's desire for the friends to be less vocal about it might conflict with the friends' need to express their identity freely.\n\nSo, the author's main issue is not with the friends being gay but with how they express their sexuality. The problem arises from the author imposing their comfort level on others, which might not be fair. The friends have the right to discuss their identity as they see fit, provided it's consensual. The author might need to find a balance between their personal boundaries and respecting the friends' autonomy.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's feelings are valid, their approach and the assumption that their friends should adjust for their discomfort might be where they're in the wrong. The friends responding with labels like \"homophobic\" could be an overreaction, but the root of the issue is the author's insistence on limiting a part of the friends' identity. Therefore, the answer is A, the author is in the wrong because they're dismissing the friends' right to express their identity freely.\n"
