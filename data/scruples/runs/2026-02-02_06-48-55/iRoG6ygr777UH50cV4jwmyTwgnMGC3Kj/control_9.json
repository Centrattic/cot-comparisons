However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them. (Even though I /clearly/ said I do accept them for their sexuality. I would just appreciate it if they didn't annoyingly mention it ever few minutes!

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not liking that their gay friends keep bringing up their sexuality, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author states they have no issue with gay people but find it annoying that their friends mention their sexuality frequently. They tried to hint at it and then directly expressed their feelings, leading to being called homophobic.\n\nNow, thinking about societal norms and attitudes toward LGBTQ+ issues. It's important to recognize that for many LGBTQ+ individuals, discussing their identity is a matter of self-expression and authenticity. They might talk about it as part of their lived experience, especially in social settings where they feel safe to be themselves. \n\nThe author's discomfort comes from the frequency of mentions, not the content. However, the friends might perceive this as invalidating their identity if they feel the author is dismissing their experiences. The author mentions they don't have an issue with being gay but want others to stay out of it. This stance is problematic because it's a form of microaggression, implying that being gay is a choice or something to be hidden. \n\nIn modern discourse, there's an emphasis on acceptance and allowing people to express their identities without shame. The author's request for others to not mention their sexuality is a form of being non-accepting, even if they don't hold explicit prejudices. The friends' reaction as homophobic is understandable because the author is essentially asking them to downplay a fundamental part of their identity to make the author comfortable. \n\nLegal and ethical standards support that discrimination based on sexual orientation is wrong, but this is more about social interactions. The author isn't opposing same-sex relationships but is uncomfortable with the visibility. The key here is that acceptance involves respecting others' expressions of their identity, even if it's uncomfortable for some. \n\nThere's a nuance here between personal comfort and respecting others' rights to express their identity. The author's approach of trying to hint and then directly stating their discomfort might have been poorly handled, but the underlying issue is the expectation that others should hide their sexuality. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's stance on wanting others to not mention their sexuality is inconsiderate of the friends' needs to express themselves authentically. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
