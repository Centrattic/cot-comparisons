However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're the asshole for not caring about gay pride and getting annoyed when two gay friends mentioned their sexuality too much. They tried to hint and then told the friends their views, leading to being called homophobic.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author says they don't have an issue with gay people but don't support gay pride. They found it uncomfortable when their friends constantly referenced their sexuality. They tried to subtly hint and then directly told the friends to stop, but were resented for it.\n\nThe key points here are acceptance vs. personal discomfort. The author claims to accept their friends but is bothered by the frequency of mentioning their sexuality. However, the friends might see it as part of their identity and important to express. The author's attempt to change the friends' behavior could be seen as dismissive or disrespectful, even if they don't have a problem with being gay in general. \n\nAlso, the friends took offense and labeled the author as homophobic. The author insists they don't have an issue, but the friends' reaction suggests they felt disrespected. The problem here is that the author is asking others to suppress a part of their identity to avoid making them uncomfortable. That's a common issue in discussions about LGBTQ+ rights\u2014people shouldn't have to hide their identity for others' comfort. \n\nSo, even though the author isn't outrightly discriminatory, their request to stop mentioning their sexuality could be seen as invalidating the friends' experiences. The friends might feel that sharing their identity is important, and the author's reaction might unintentionally contribute to a hostile environment. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they're prioritizing their comfort over the friends' right to express their identity openly.\n"
