However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author met two gay people who kept mentioning their sexuality a lot, which made the author uncomfortable. The author tried to hint that they didn't want that focus and then directly told them, leading to being called homophobic even though they said they accept people.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author says they don't have an issue with gay people but don't support gay pride. They mention being uncomfortable with the constant references to being gay. The other people felt they were being rejected because they were called homophobic when they only wanted the others to not mention it so much.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong for not wanting their friends to discuss their sexuality so frequently. From a social perspective, people often express their identity, including their sexuality, as part of who they are. If someone is comfortable with their identity and they choose to mention it, others might find it annoying, but that doesn't make the person in the wrong for not wanting to hear it. However, the author is not opposing their sexuality; they're just asking them to stop bringing it up. \n\nBut from a different angle, if someone is being open about their identity, it's part of their authenticity. The author might be uncomfortable, but that doesn't give them the right to expect others to hide parts of themselves. The friends might feel that the author is rejecting their identity even if it's not the case. \n\nAlso, the author tried to hint and then directly state their discomfort. Even if they said they accept them, the friends might perceive that as not accepting their identity. In many social contexts, respecting someone's identity includes allowing them to express it without pressure to hide it. So, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the friends' need to express their sexuality openly.\n\nMoreover, the friends called the author homophobic, which the author denies. But if the author is making them feel like they need to hide their identity, that could be seen as a form of homophobia, even if unintentional. It's about creating a safe space for people to be themselves without feeling judged or needing to suppress parts of their identity.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, especially in more inclusive environments, expecting someone to downplay their sexuality could be considered dismissive. The author might not have malicious intent, but the impact on the friends is real. So, even if the author's intention is neutral, the action of asking them to hide their identity could be problematic.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A), because they are not accepting the friends' need to express their identity openly, which is a part of being authentic and accepted.\n"
