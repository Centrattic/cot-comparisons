However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them. (Even though I /clearly/ said I do accept them for their sexuality. I would just appreciate it if they didn't annoyingly mention it ever few minutes! Am I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Alright, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in a situation where they expressed discomfort with their friends being too vocal about their sexuality. The author claims they don't have an issue with gay people but find it annoying when their friends mention it frequently. They tried to subtly hint at it and then directly told them, leading to being called homophobic.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and social aspects. The friends are openly discussing their identity, which is a personal choice. The author, while stating they don't have a problem with being gay, seems uncomfortable with the frequency of mentions. However, the key here is the author's approach. They tried to hint and then directly express their feelings. But their friends might feel that the author is being intolerant of their identity, even if the author's intent was just to reduce the mentions.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of \"allyship\" and respecting someone's identity. Even if someone is not an active supporter, respecting others' identities is crucial. The author might be seen as not fully accepting their friends' identities if they find it annoying, regardless of their personal stance. Also, the friends might feel that the author is being insincere or not supportive enough, leading to them feeling disrespected.\n\nHowever, the author's intention wasn't to be homophobic but to avoid discomfort. But the line between personal preference and respecting others' identities can be thin. The author might be projecting their discomfort onto the situation, not considering that their friends expressing their identity is a valid and important part of their self-expression.\n\nIn social contexts, it's often expected to respect others' identities even if they are outspoken. The author's friends have the right to express their sexuality, and the author's request to \"keep it out\" might infringe on that right. The author's approach in addressing the issue could come across as dismissive or discriminatory, even if unintentionally.\n\nSo, considering these points, the author might be in the wrong because they are asking others to suppress a part of their identity, which can be seen as disrespectful. The friends have every right to express their identity, and the author's discomfort shouldn't dictate that. The author should work on accepting and respecting their friends' expressions of identity, even if it's uncomfortable.\n"
