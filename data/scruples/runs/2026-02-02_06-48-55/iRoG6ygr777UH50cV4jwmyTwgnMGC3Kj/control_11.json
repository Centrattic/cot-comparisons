However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them.

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author says they met two gay people but started disliking them because they kept mentioning being gay in every conversation. The author tried to hint subtly that it was too much, then directly told them their beliefs, and was called homophobic. The author claims they don't have an issue with gay people but just don't want to hear about their sexuality so often. They ask if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, the main point here is about respect and boundaries. The author's issue isn't with the people's sexuality itself but the frequency of them mentioning it. The question is whether the author is wrong for feeling that way and acting on it.\n\nFrom a social perspective, people often expect others to respect their identities. However, the author isn't opposing their sexuality but is uncomfortable with how often it's brought up. But the problem comes when the author tried to address this. The friends felt their identity was being dismissed. Even though the author said they accept them, the way they addressed it might have come off as rejecting their identity.\n\nThe key is whether it's reasonable to expect people to not mention their own identity. The friends might feel that their sexuality is an important part of who they are and that the author is being dismissive by wanting them to not mention it. The author's request could be seen as invalidating their friends' identities. Also, the friends' reaction (calling them homophobic) might be a result of feeling that their identity is being downplayed, which in turn makes the author's actions problematic.\n\nSo, even though the author has a right to their discomfort, how they handled it might be where they're in the wrong. They should have approached the conversation differently, perhaps focusing on their feelings without implying that the friends' identity is an issue. The author's method of expressing their discomfort might have been counterproductive and hurtful, leading to the friends feeling unaccepted.\n\nIn AITA scenarios like this, the community often looks at intent versus impact. The author's intent was to express discomfort, but the impact was making the friends feel unaccepted, which is a key point. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong because their approach led to resentment and could be seen as dismissing the friends' identity, even if that wasn't the intention.\n"
