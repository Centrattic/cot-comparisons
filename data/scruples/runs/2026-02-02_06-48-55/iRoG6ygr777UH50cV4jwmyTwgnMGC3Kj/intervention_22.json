However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them. (Even though I /clearly/ said I do accept them for their sexuality. I would just appreciate it if they didn't annoyingly mention it ever few minutes! Am I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the \"AITA\" scenario is wrong for not caring about gay pride and being annoyed by others mentioning their sexuality too much. The person says they don't have an issue with gay people but get uncomfortable when their friends make it a big deal. They tried hinting and then stating their views, which led to being called homophobic.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author is in the wrong. The key points are: the author dislikes the constant mention of being gay, not the people themselves. They say they accept them but want it to not be an issue. The friends took offense, calling them homophobic. \n\nThe author's stance is that they don't support gay pride but accept people regardless. However, the problem here is the friends' behavior of constantly referencing their sexuality. The author's issue isn't with their sexuality but with how they present it. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about respecting boundaries. If someone is making it a big deal, the author's discomfort is valid, but expressing that in a way that's clear without being dismissive is important. However, the author's comments might come across as invalidating, even if they don't mean to be. They might not realize that for some people, discussing their identity is important and not just an annoyance. \n\nAlso, the friends might feel that the author's desire to avoid the topic is a form of rejection, even if it's not. The author's approach might not be the best way to handle it, but is it wrong? They're not discriminatory but are struggling with social dynamics. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's actions were disrespectful. Since they tried to communicate their feelings, even if it backfired, maybe they aren't entirely wrong. But some might argue that in a society where LGBTQ+ individuals often face prejudice, the author's discomfort could be seen as contributing to a hostile environment. However, the author isn't opposing them, just not wanting the topic to be constant. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong), because the author isn't discriminatory but is dealing with a personal discomfort in social interactions. However, it's a nuanced situation where the friends might feel their identity is being downplayed.\n"
