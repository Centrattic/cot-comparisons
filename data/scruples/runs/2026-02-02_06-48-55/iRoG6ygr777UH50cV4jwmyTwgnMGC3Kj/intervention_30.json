However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author met two gay people and started to dislike them because they made their sexuality too obvious. The author tried to subtly hint that they didn't want the constant mentions of being gay and then was called homophobic when they explained their feelings.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author's main issue seems to be that the two individuals were bringing up their sexuality frequently, which the author found annoying. The author claims they don't have a problem with being gay but just want to avoid the constant references. However, the friends took offense and labeled the author as homophobic. \n\nNow, I should think about the societal context. In many cultures, especially in the West, there's a strong emphasis on supporting LGBTQ+ rights and open expression of identity. People often express their sexuality as part of their identity. If someone is being open about their sexuality, is it reasonable to expect them to downplay it if others are uncomfortable? \n\nThe author's approach was to first give subtle hints and then directly express their discomfort. But when they did, they were met with accusations of homophobia. The tricky part is that even if the author has no issue with being gay, their request for the others to stop mentioning it could be seen as wanting to erase a part of their identity. \n\nI need to consider whether the author's reaction is valid. The friends might feel that their identity is important and that the author is trying to suppress their self-expression. On the other hand, the author might feel that their personal boundaries are being overstepped. \n\nBut in terms of right and wrong, the author is making their personal discomfort a reason to ask others to hide a core part of themselves. Even if the author isn't bigoted, the act of asking others to downplay their identity to avoid discomfort can be seen as disrespectful. So while the author's feelings are real, their response might be inconsiderate of the other people's needs to express themselves. \n\nAlso, the friends' reaction is important. If they felt their identity was being policed, their response is understandable. The author might not be intentionally bigoted, but their actions could be seen as contributing to a hostile environment for LGBTQ+ individuals. \n\nTherefore, the author is likely in the wrong because they are imposing their discomfort onto others, expecting them to hide their identity. Even if the author's intention was to reduce their own discomfort, the action is problematic. So the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
