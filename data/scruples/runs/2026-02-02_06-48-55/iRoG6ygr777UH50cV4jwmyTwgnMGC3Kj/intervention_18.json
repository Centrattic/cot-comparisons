However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about someone not wanting their gay friends to mention their sexuality so frequently. The author says they don't have an issue with being gay but feel that bringing it up constantly is annoying and made them uncomfortable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author met two gay people and initially liked them. Then they started mentioning their sexuality a lot, which made the author uncomfortable. The author tried to hint at them to stop but when that didn't work, they expressed their feelings directly and were met with accusations of being homophobic. The key points here are the author's discomfort, the frequency of mentions, and their response.\n\nNow, thinking about societal norms and LGBTQ+ experiences. Many people in the LGBTQ+ community feel the need to assert their identity in a world that may not always accept them. Mentioning their sexuality might be a way to affirm their identity or seek support. The author's frustration could be seen as invalidating that experience. Even if the author says they don't have a problem with being gay, the pushback the friends gave suggests that the author's comments might have come across as dismissive or judgmental, even unintentionally.\n\nAlso, the author's approach: they tried subtle hints first but when that didn't work, they told their beliefs. However, if they didn't express it clearly, maybe their friends didn't understand. But the friends felt called out, which indicates that the author's statements might have been perceived as negative, even if the author intended neutrality.\n\nFrom a social perspective, respecting someone's identity and their need to express it is important. If someone is making others uncomfortable by constantly mentioning their sexuality, there's a balance. But the author's discomfort shouldn't override the friends' autonomy to express their identity. The friends might have felt that the author's insistence on not talking about it was a form of rejection or not accepting them fully.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because they're asking others to suppress a key part of their identity, which is about acceptance and respect. Even if the author has no issue with being gay, the way they reacted could be seen as not supporting their friends' need to be open about their sexuality. Hence, the answer would be A (yes, in the wrong).\n"
