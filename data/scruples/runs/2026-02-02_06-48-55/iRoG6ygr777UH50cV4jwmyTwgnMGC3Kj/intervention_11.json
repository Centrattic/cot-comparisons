However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author met two gay people who kept mentioning their sexuality a lot, making the author uncomfortable. The author tried to hint they didn't want that and then told them their beliefs, got called homophobic, and now is asking if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author says they don't have an issue with gay people but find the constant mentions annoying. They tried to hint it and then explained their beliefs. The other people felt unaccepted and called the author homophobic. \n\nFrom a social perspective, many communities, especially LGBTQ+ individuals, often share their identities openly as part of their experience and as a way to show pride. The author's discomfort might stem from a personal preference for not discussing that aspect, but expecting others to downplay their identity could be seen as dismissive. \n\nThe author's statement that they \"would just appreciate it if they didn't annoyingly mention it every few minutes\" suggests a desire for others to conform to their comfort level. However, in many cases, people's identities are important to them, and they might feel the need to express that openly, especially in environments where they feel the need to be visible in their pride. \n\nAlso, the author claims they don't have an issue but are being called homophobic. This could be because the way the author expressed their discomfort might have come across as not accepting. Even if the author's intent was to just set boundaries, the response from the others indicates that their approach was perceived as negative. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider that the other people's frequent mentions of their sexuality are part of their identity and their right to express it. The author's reaction, instead of being a neutral boundary, might be seen as invalidating the other's experience. \n\nBut wait, the author says they accept them but just don't want the constant mentions. Is that reasonable? It's a bit of a gray area. However, in many cases, people are expected to respect others' identities, even if they find it uncomfortable. The author's actions here are about their own discomfort rather than any actual harm, but social norms often prioritize the expression of identity over personal discomfort. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong because they are expecting others to suppress a fundamental part of their identity for the author's comfort, which isn't a valid reason. So the answer is A.\n"
