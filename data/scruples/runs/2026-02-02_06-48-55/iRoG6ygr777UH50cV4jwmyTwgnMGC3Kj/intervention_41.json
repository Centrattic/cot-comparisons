I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them.

After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this step by step. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not caring about gay pride and feeling uncomfortable with two gay friends who mention their sexuality a lot.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author says they don't have an issue with gay people but don't support gay pride. They met two gay individuals and initially liked them, but over time, the author started feeling annoyed because the friends kept emphasizing their sexuality in every conversation. The author tried to hint subtly that this was happening too much, then directly told them their beliefs, which led to being called homophobic despite the author's insistence that they accept their sexuality. Now the author is asking if they're the asshole for not wanting the friends to mention their sexuality so often.\n\nSo, the key points here are the author's discomfort with the frequency of mentions about being gay, their attempts to address it, and the backlash they received. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nFrom a social perspective, it's important to respect people's identities. If someone is part of a marginalized group, they might feel the need to assert their identity more in interactions, especially if they've faced discrimination. The author's friends might feel that mentioning their sexuality is part of their identity and necessary for authenticity. However, the author feels that this is overdone and intrusive.\n\nThe author's actions: first trying to hint subtly, then being direct. The friends took offense, calling them homophobic. The author claims they accept the friends' sexuality but find the constant mentions annoying. The crux here is whether the author's reaction is valid or if they are overstepping by expecting the friends to refrain from discussing their identity.\n\nLegally and ethically, it's against the law in many places to discriminate based on sexual orientation. But this isn't about discrimination; it's about personal interaction. The problem is more about social dynamics and personal boundaries. The author isn't opposing their sexuality but is uncomfortable with how often it's brought up. However, the friends might see their identity as integral to who they are, so downplaying it could feel like a request to hide their true selves.\n\nIn terms of social norms, people can express their identity as part of their conversations. If the friends are doing this in every sentence, it might be excessive, but the author's response could be seen as dismissive of the friends' need to express their identity. The author's directness might have come off as invalidating, even if they didn't mean to be homophobic.\n\nThe friends calling them homophobic might be a reaction to the author making their discomfort explicit, which could be interpreted as rejection. The author's stance is that they accept the sexuality but want less mention of it. However, in social contexts, asking someone to not talk about their identity can be seen as wanting them to be less visible or authentic, which ties into the concept of assimilation or erasure.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's issue is with the frequency of mentioning their sexuality rather than the identity itself. But in doing so, they might be imposing their discomfort on the friends, who might feel they have the right to express their identity freely. The author's approach could be seen as invalidating the friends' experiences, especially if their insistence on not talking about it is based on personal dislike rather than respecting boundaries.\n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong because their response to the friends' identity expression is based on personal annoyance rather than genuine acceptance. They might not fully understand the friends' perspective or the importance of expressing their identity, leading to a conflict where the author's preferences override the friends' need to be authentic. The friends' reaction, while perhaps harsh, stems from feeling that their identity is being policed or minimized. Hence, the author's actions could be considered insensitive, even if they don't hold the same prejudices.\n"
