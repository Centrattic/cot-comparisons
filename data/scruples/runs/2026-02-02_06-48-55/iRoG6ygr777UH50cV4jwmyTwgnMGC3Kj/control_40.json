However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them. (Even though I /clearly/ said I do accept them for their sexuality. I would just appreciate it if they didn't annoyingly mention it ever few minutes! Am I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is that the author met two gay people and found their constant mention of being gay annoying. The author tried to hint they should stop but then got labeled as homophobic when they explained their feelings. They're asking if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author doesn't have a problem with gay people but is bothered by the frequent references. They tried to address it subtly and then directly, but were met with accusations of homophobia. The core issue here is about respect and boundaries.\n\nOn one hand, the author's discomfort with the constant mentions might be valid. Everyone has different sensitivities. However, the people they met might feel the need to express their identity openly, which is a natural part of being themselves. The author's reaction could be seen as dismissing their identity or making them feel that their being gay is an issue. \n\nBut the author did clarify they accept them as individuals. The problem arises when their acceptance is conditional on not having to be reminded of the other person's sexuality. The other individuals might feel that their identity is being minimized or that the author is uncomfortable with their openness. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, being part of the LGBTQ+ community often involves navigating spaces where one's identity is either ignored or overemphasized. If someone is making a point of their identity in every conversation, it's part of their experience. The author's frustration here is about the frequency, not the content. However, telling someone to stop being open about their identity can be perceived as invalidating, even if the author's intention was to avoid discomfort. \n\nSo, the author's actions might be seen as inconsiderate of the other person's need to express their identity. The key here is that the author's request for less mention could be interpreted as wanting the other person to hide a core part of themselves, which is a form of microaggression. Thus, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the other's openness and for contributing to a hostile environment, even unintentionally.\n"
