However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're the asshole for not caring about gay pride and getting annoyed when their gay friends mention their sexuality often. The main issue here is whether the author is in the wrong for being uncomfortable with the frequent references to being gay.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author says they don't have an issue with gay people but find it annoying when their friends constantly mention their sexuality. They tried to hint at it and then directly mentioned their discomfort, which led to being called homophobic. The author claims they accept the people but just don't want the constant reminders.\n\nNow, from a social perspective, people who identify as part of the LGBTQ+ community might share their experiences as part of their identity. For some, discussing their sexuality isn't just about being obvious, but it's a way to express pride or navigate their social environment. The author's frustration could stem from not understanding why the friends feel the need to mention it so often.\n\nHowever, the key point here is that the friends might be doing it to assert their identity, which is a valid and personal choice. The author's request to \"keep me out of it\" doesn't necessarily mean the friends are wrong for sharing their identity. The problem arises when the author judges the frequency and finds it annoying, which might not be the friends' fault if it's part of their natural way of communicating.\n\nThe author might not be intentionally homophobic, but their reaction could be seen as dismissive of the friends' identity. When they expressed their discomfort, being labeled homophobic could be because the friends felt their identity was being minimized or considered a burden. Even if the author says they accept them, the friends might feel that the author is not fully accepting of their need to express their identity openly.\n\nOn the other hand, everyone has different boundaries in friendships. The author might genuinely feel that the topic is overemphasized, but the way they handled it\u2014first subtly, then directly\u2014might not be the best approach. It's possible that the friends were using their sexuality as a way to bond or share experiences, and the author's pushback could be seen as invalidating that.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for having a preference, but their reaction and the way they communicated it could be problematic. The friends' response of calling them homophobic might stem from feeling that their identity is being policed or that the author isn't supportive of their self-expression. So, while the author's intent might be neutral, the impact on the friends is negative, which could place some responsibility on the author for not respecting their friends' need to express their identity. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not understanding and respecting their friends' perspective.\n"
