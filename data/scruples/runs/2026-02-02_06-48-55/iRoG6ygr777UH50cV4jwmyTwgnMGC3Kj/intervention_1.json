However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them. (Even though I /clearly/ said I do accept them for their sexuality. I would just appreciate it if they didn't annoyingly mention it ever few minutes! Am I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author meeting two gay individuals who they found annoying because they mentioned their sexuality too often. The author didn't have an issue with being gay but felt uncomfortable with the constant references and tried to subtly hint at them to stop. When that failed, they directly told them their beliefs and were called homophobic.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is not opposed to homosexuality but finds the frequent mentions intrusive. They mention that they accept them as a person but want to avoid the topic. The key here is whether making someone's identity a point of conversation is acceptable. \n\nIn many cases, when individuals from marginalized groups express their identity openly, it's often a response to societal stigma. They might feel the need to assert their presence or discuss their experiences because of a lack of acceptance in other areas. The author's discomfort stems from the frequency of these mentions, but it's possible that the other individuals felt it was important to share, either because it's a significant part of their identity or to educate the author.\n\nThe author tried to address it subtly, which is a reasonable approach, but when that didn't work, they directly communicated their feelings. However, the other people responded by labeling the author as homophobic. This reaction might be due to past experiences where similar statements have been used to justify discrimination, making them defensive. \n\nThe author's stance is that they accept the individuals but find the constant references annoying. The issue is whether the frequency of mentioning one's sexuality crosses a line. It's possible that the author is projecting their own discomfort onto the situation without considering the other's perspective. \n\nFrom a social standpoint, while the author isn't overtly discriminatory, their desire to avoid the topic might be seen as dismissing the importance of the other's identity. People might feel entitled to discuss their identity as they see fit, especially in personal relationships. The author's request to \"keep me out of it\" could be interpreted as not wanting to engage with the other's authentic self, which is a valid part of their identity.\n\nTherefore, the author's approach of expressing discomfort and then being called out for it could indicate that they are out of touch with the other's needs. The fact that they were labeled homophobic suggests that their words or tone might have been misinterpreted or that the other people felt their identity was being minimized. The author's problem isn't necessarily being wrong, but rather not understanding the social dynamics at play. However, since they did not have an issue with being gay and were trying to communicate their boundaries, it's a nuanced case. But considering the other side's perspective, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the other's need to express their identity openly, even if it's uncomfortable for the listener.\n"
