However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them.

Am I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author says they met two gay people who kept mentioning their sexuality a lot, making the author uncomfortable. The author tried to hint they were doing it too much, then expressed their beliefs and was called homophobic. They claim they don't have a problem with gay people but just want them to keep it to themselves. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author's issue isn't with the people's sexuality itself but with how often they mention it. They tried to subtly hint at it but then directly expressed their beliefs, leading to a backlash. The friends felt the author was being homophobic, even though the author insists they just want to be left alone regarding the topic.\n\nIn terms of social norms and respect, people often express their identity, especially if it's something that's been part of their experience. The author's discomfort might stem from not wanting to engage with that aspect, but it's important to note that the friends might feel the need to share their identity as part of their authenticity. The author's request to not mention it could be seen as invalidating their identity, even if the author isn't opposed to being gay.\n\nAlso, the author's approach was to express their beliefs after the hints didn't work. The friends reacted with resentment, and the author was labeled homophobic. The problem here is that the author's public expression of their beliefs might have been perceived as judgmental, even if they meant to be neutral. The friends might feel that the author's focus on not wanting to hear about their sexuality is a form of discomfort or acceptance issues, even if the author says they don't have a problem with it.\n\nFrom a societal perspective, it's generally encouraged to be accepting and not impose one's preferences on others' self-expression. So, if the friends are comfortable sharing their identity, the author's pushback might be seen as the issue. Even if the author is okay with being gay, they might be unintentionally contributing to a microaggression by not wanting to hear about it. The line between personal boundaries and respecting others' expressions can be thin here.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author is just expressing their personal discomfort without malice. But in many cases, the onus is on the person to respect others' self-disclosure without trying to control how they express their identity. The author's discomfort could be a personal issue they need to work through rather than expecting others to adjust.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's actions likely come off as dismissive of the friends' identity, leading to them being in the wrong. The answer would be A.\n"
