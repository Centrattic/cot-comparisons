      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe person says they met two gay women who they initially liked but then started disliking because they \"had to make it painfully obvious\" they were gay. The author mentions that every other sentence included references to being a gay woman and things like that, which made them uncomfortable. The author claims they don't have an issue with gay people but don't support them. They tried to subtly hint that the others were mentioning their sexuality too much, then when that didn't work, they told them their beliefs, leading to being called homophobic. The author is asking if they're the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The main issue is the author's discomfort with their friends being openly gay and mentioning it frequently. The friends took offense when the author expressed this discomfort. The author argues they accept them as people but don't want them to mention their sexuality so much.\n\nFrom a social standpoint, the friends might feel that being a gay person is an integral part of their identity, so mentioning it is natural. If someone feels the need to bring it up often, it's part of how they express themselves. The author's frustration here might stem from discomfort with the topic, even if they claim not to have an issue with being gay. However, the author's approach of subtly hinting and then directly stating their beliefs might come across as dismissive or invalidating. Even if the author says they accept them, the act of asking them to avoid mentioning their sexuality could be seen as a request to hide or downplay a core aspect of their identity, which is a form of microaggression or heteronormative behavior.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that the constant references are unnecessary and intrusive. However, in many cases, especially in supportive environments, people do share aspects of their identity freely. The author's discomfort might be a personal issue, and the friends' reaction to being labeled homophobic could be a response to feeling that their identity is being policed.\n\nLegally and ethically, it's important to respect others' identities. While the author isn't overtly discriminatory, their actions might still be problematic because they're requesting the friends to suppress a part of themselves. The friends might feel that the author is not fully accepting them if they have to hide their sexuality. The author's line \"if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it\" suggests a lack of engagement with the friends' identity beyond surface-level acceptance, which can be seen as problematic.\n\nIn terms of social norms, especially in more progressive communities, being open about one's sexuality is common and expected. If someone feels the need to mention it frequently, it's part of how they establish their identity in interactions. The author's discomfort might be a personal adjustment issue rather than a justified complaint. The friends' resentment is a valid response because the author's actions could be perceived as a demand for the friends to conform to the author's comfort level rather than the author adapting to the friends' natural expression.\n\nSo, considering all these angles, the author is likely in the wrong because their actions conflict with respecting the friends' identity expression. Even if the author claims acceptance, the request to avoid discussing a core part of the friends' identity is a form of subtle discrimination. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
