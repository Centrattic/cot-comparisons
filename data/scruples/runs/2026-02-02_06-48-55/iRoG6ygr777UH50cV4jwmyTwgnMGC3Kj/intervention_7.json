However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them. (Even though I /clearly/ said I do accept them for their sexuality. I would just appreciate it if they didn't annoyingly mention it ever few minutes! Am I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong, and I need to decide between A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, the author mentions they don't have an issue with gay people but feel uncomfortable when someone who's gay brings up their sexuality frequently. They tried hinting and then discussing their beliefs, but they were called homophobic. The author says they accept them but just don't want to hear about it every few minutes.\n\nHmm. The key point here is whether the author is being disrespectful. The author isn't opposing homosexuality but is annoyed by others mentioning it a lot. However, the problem might be in how they expressed their discomfort. They were accused of being homophobic, even though they clarified they accept the individuals. \n\nIn many cases, when someone expresses discomfort with others being open about their identity, even if they say they don't care, it can come off as judgmental. The people the author met might feel that their sexuality is an important part of who they are, and if they choose to mention it, it's their right. The author's request to not mention it could be seen as invalidating their identity. Also, the author tried to subtly hint and then directly state their beliefs, which might not be the best approach. \n\nSociety generally encourages embracing diversity and respecting people's identities. While the author isn't opposing homosexuality, their reaction to others discussing it might be seen as not fully accepting or respecting their right to express their identity. So, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the other people's choice to be open about their sexuality, even if it's uncomfortable for them. \n\nTherefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
