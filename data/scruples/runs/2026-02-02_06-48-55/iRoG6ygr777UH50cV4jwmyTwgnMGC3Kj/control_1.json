However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them. (Even though I /clearly/ said I do accept them for their sexuality. I would just appreciate it if they didn't annoyingly mention it ever few minutes! Am I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The author is someone who doesn't care about gay pride and becomes uncomfortable when two gay people they met keep mentioning their sexuality. The author tries to hint and then directly tell them to stop, but gets called homophobic. The question is whether they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and social aspects. Homosexuality is protected in many places, and anti-discrimination laws exist. But the situation here isn't about discrimination in a legal sense. It's more about personal interactions. The author states they don't have an issue with gay people but find the constant mention of being gay annoying.\n\nNow, the key points. The author doesn't oppose being around gay people but is uncomfortable with the frequency of them mentioning their sexuality. They tried to hint and then directly ask them to stop. The friends reacted by calling them homophobic. The author's stance is that they accept the people but just don't want them to bring up their sexuality so much.\n\nIn terms of social norms and respect, people should be able to express their identity without being told to stop. Even if someone is accepting of a person's sexuality, asking them to refrain from discussing it could be seen as invalidating their identity. The friends might have felt that their right to express their identity was being suppressed, which could be why they labeled the author as homophobic, even if unintentionally.\n\nAlso, the author's approach of giving subtle hints and then direct feedback might not have been the best way to address the issue. It's possible that the friends felt their identities were being criticized rather than the frequency of mentions. The author's frustration is valid if they found it annoying, but the way they addressed it might have been misinterpreted or inappropriate.\n\nAnother angle: the author's statement that they \"wouldn't go as far as to support them\" could be seen as not being fully accepting. Support in this context might mean respecting someone's identity and their right to discuss it. If someone feels the need to distance themselves from supporting an aspect of someone's identity, even if they claim to accept the person, it could be problematic.\n\nHowever, the author does say they accept the people for their sexuality, which is a key point. The issue is more about the expression of that identity. But in many societies, people have the right to discuss their identity as they see fit, and others shouldn't demand they remain silent. Thus, the author's request might be seen as infringing on the friends' right to self-expression.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author might not have malicious intent, their actions could be seen as dismissive of the friends' identity. The friends' reaction, though perhaps harsh, is based on the perception that their identity is being criticized. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong for not respecting the friends' right to express their identity, even if it's annoying.\n"
