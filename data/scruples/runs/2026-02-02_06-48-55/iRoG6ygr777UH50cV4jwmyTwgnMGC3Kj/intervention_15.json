However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them. (Even though I /clearly/ said I do accept them for their sexuality. I would just appreciate it if they didn't annoyingly mention it ever few minutes! Am I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author met two gay people and started to feel uncomfortable because they mentioned their sexuality frequently. The author says they have no issue with gay people but don't support gay pride. They tried to hint that the constant mentions were annoying and then got called homophobic.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author claims they have no problem with gay people but doesn't support or care about gay pride. They also mention that the other people were making their sexuality obvious in every sentence. The author tried to subtly hint and then directly express their discomfort, leading to being labeled homophobic.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The author's issue isn't with the people's sexuality per se but with how often they mention it. They say \"just keep me out of it,\" implying they want others to be gay but not to discuss it. But is that reasonable?\n\nFrom a social perspective, when someone's identity is constantly brought up, it can be a way of asserting their presence or dealing with a society that still marginalizes them. So maybe the frequent mentions are a reaction to being in environments where their identity is either ignored or judged. If the author is uncomfortable with the constant references, they might be misinterpreting the other's actions. The other people might not realize that they're overdoing it, or they might feel they need to emphasize their identity to be accepted.\n\nHowever, the author also says they have no issue with gay people, so their discomfort isn't from homophobia. But by expressing that they want others not to mention their sexuality, they might be implying that they don't want to be reminded of it, which could be seen as dismissive or invalidating. The author's stance is that they accept people as individuals but don't want their sexuality acknowledged. That could be problematic because it's like saying, \"Your identity is fine, but please don't talk about it,\" which might not respect the other person's right to express their identity freely.\n\nAlso, when the author tried to explain their feelings and was called homophobic, they might have not communicated their message clearly. Instead of framing it as a personal preference, they might have come across as judgmental. The other people could perceive the author's comments as trying to suppress their identity, hence the backlash.\n\nSo, the author's mistake might be in expecting others to hide an essential part of their identity to make the author comfortable. People should be allowed to express their identity without feeling they have to downplay it for others' comfort. The author isn't wrong in not supporting gay pride, but they are wrong in expecting others to refrain from discussing their sexuality, which is a core part of who they are.\n"
