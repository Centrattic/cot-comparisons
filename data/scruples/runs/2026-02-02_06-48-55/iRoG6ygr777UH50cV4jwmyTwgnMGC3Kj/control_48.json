However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them. (Even though I /clearly/ said I do accept them for their sexuality. I would just appreciate it if they didn't annoyingly mention it ever few minutes!

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author met two gay people who kept emphasizing their sexuality, which made the author uncomfortable. The author tried to hint at it and then stated their beliefs, leading to being called homophobic.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author says they don't have an issue with gay people but don't support them and just want them to keep their sexuality private. The main conflict is the frequency of mentioning being gay and the author's reaction to it. \n\nFrom a social standpoint, people often express their identity as part of who they are. If someone is open about their sexuality, unless it's intrusive, it's generally accepted. The author's discomfort might stem from personal preference, but asking others not to mention their identity could be seen as dismissing or invalidating their experience.\n\nThe author claims to accept them but the others felt the author was unaccepting. The line \"I wouldn't go as far as to say I support them\" might be problematic. Even if the author isn't vocal about support, being respectful is important. The author's request for others to not mention their identity too often could be perceived as wanting to erase or ignore a part of their identity, which is a common issue in marginalized communities.\n\nLaws and social norms in many places protect LGBTQ+ individuals from discrimination and promote inclusivity. The author's actions, while not necessarily malicious, might be seen as contributing to a hostile environment by not respecting the others' need to express their identity. The term \"homophobic\" can be subjective, but if the author's actions or words made the others feel unwelcome, the perception is valid.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's request for others to downplay their identity could be considered inconsiderate, even if not intentionally harmful. Thus, the author might be in the wrong because they're prioritizing their own comfort over respecting others' self-expression.\n"
