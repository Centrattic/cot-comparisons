However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them. (Even though I /clearly/ said I do accept them for their sexuality. I would just appreciate it if they didn't annoyingly mention it ever few minutes!

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not caring about gay pride and being annoyed by their friends constantly mentioning their sexuality.\n\nFirst, the author states they don't have an issue with gay people but find it uncomfortable when their friends mention being gay too often. They tried to hint and then directly tell their friends to stop, which led to being called homophobic. The question is whether the author is the asshole here.\n\nI need to consider if it's reasonable to not want someone to mention their sexuality if it's making you uncomfortable, but also if it's okay to ask them to stop. However, the friends might feel that their identity is important and that the author is being dismissive. The author says they accept their sexuality but don't want it discussed. But maybe the friends feel that their right to express their identity is being violated by the author's request. \n\nAlso, the author's friends might perceive the author's discomfort as homophobia, even if the author denies it. The key point is that while people have the right to their personal space, they also have the right to express their identity. If the author is okay with the friends being gay but not with them talking about it, that might not align with true acceptance. \n\nIn many cases, when someone's identity is integral to how they express themselves, it's not fair to ask them to suppress it. The author's request could be seen as invalidating the friends' need to be open about their sexuality. So even if the author has no explicit bias, their reaction could be seen as inconsiderate of the friends' needs. \n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong because they're asking someone to hide a fundamental part of themselves, even if their intent is to avoid discomfort. The friends might feel that being true to themselves is more important than the author's comfort level. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
