However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about not caring about gay pride and being annoyed by two gay friends who mention their sexuality too much.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author says they have no issue with gay people but don't support them. They found it uncomfortable that their friends kept bringing up their sexuality in every sentence. When they tried to hint and then directly mention their discomfort, they were called homophobic despite saying they accept their sexuality.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks they are, but wants confirmation. So I need to analyze the situation from both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the author is expressing discomfort about their friends being too vocal about their sexuality. They might feel that the friends are making it about their orientation too much, which could be a personal boundary issue. But on the other hand, the friends might feel that their identity is important and that the author is trying to shut them down, which could be seen as dismissive or even subtle discrimination.\n\nThe key points here are about respect for personal boundaries versus the right to express one's identity. The author's friends are asserting their identity, which is a fundamental aspect of who they are. The author, while stating they accept their sexuality, is trying to limit how often it's discussed, which could be seen as invalidating their experience. \n\nAlso, the friends reacting with calling the author homophobic could be a reaction to feeling that their identity is being downplayed or ignored. The author might not have intended to be homophobic, but their actions could be perceived as such, especially in a context where LGBTQ+ individuals often face marginalization and have to constantly assert their identity.\n\nAnother angle is that the author's friends might have a valid reason to talk about their experiences, especially if they're in an environment where their identity is not widely accepted. The author might not realize the significance of those mentions and how important it is for the friends to express their identity.\n\nHowever, the author might feel that their own comfort is being invaded. It's a conflict between personal space and identity expression. But in social interactions, especially among friends, there's an expectation of mutual respect. If the friends were being inconsiderate, the author has the right to express discomfort. But if the friends are just being themselves, the author's reaction might be seen as pushing back against their self-expression.\n\nIt's important to consider that while the author claims no problem with being gay, their behavior might still come across as judgmental. The friends might feel that when the author brings up their beliefs, it's not just about the frequency but the content, which could imply disapproval. Even if the author states they accept them, the act of pointing out the frequency could be seen as wanting them to be less open about their identity, which is a form of microaggression.\n\nIn many cases, when someone is called homophobic, it's because their actions or words, even if not malicious, contribute to a negative environment for LGBTQ+ individuals. The author's insistence on the friends not mentioning their sexuality could be perceived as trying to erase or invalidate their identity, which is a form of homophobia, even if unintentional.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions, while perhaps well-intentioned, might indeed be inconsiderate of their friends' need to express their identity. The friends' reaction, though strong, could be a justified response to feeling that their identity is being dismissed. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
