However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves two people who are gay, and the author of the post says they've grown uncomfortable because these individuals mention their sexuality frequently. The author claims they have no issue with being gay but find the constant references annoying and tried to hint at it before being called homophobic.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author is not opposed to being gay but is bothered by the frequency of the mentions. They tried to hint at their discomfort but were met with accusations of being homophobic. The core question is whether the author is wrong for not wanting to hear about their sexuality so often and for expressing that.\n\nFrom a social and ethical standpoint, it's important to respect others' identities. However, people have different comfort levels. The author isn't rejecting the individuals for being gay; they're just asking them to stop bringing it up. On the flip side, the individuals might feel their identity is important to share, especially if they're in a space where they can be open about it. \n\nThere's a balance between respecting someone's identity and not overimposing on others. The author's issue isn't with the people's sexuality but with how often it's mentioned. However, the individuals might feel that their right to express their identity is being stifled. The author tried to communicate this subtly, but when that didn't work, they were more direct. \n\nThe response from the individuals, calling the author homophobic, might be an overreaction if they believed the author was being intolerant. But the author did clarify they accept their sexuality, just not the constant references. The challenge here is whether the author's request is reasonable. \n\nIn many cases, people have different boundaries. While the author isn't being hostile towards the individuals' sexuality, they're asking for personal space in terms of conversation topics. However, it's possible that the individuals see their identity as central to who they are and feel it's natural to discuss it. \n\nLegally and ethically, the author isn't violating any rights by not supporting gay pride, as the post states they don't have an issue with being gay. However, socially, there might be expectations to be more accepting or supportive, but the author's main issue is the frequency of mentions, not the support itself. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's actions (expressing discomfort with the frequency) cross into being dismissive of the individuals' identity. If the author is respectful and not making the individuals feel unwelcome, they might not be in the wrong. However, if the author is making the individuals feel invalidated or that their identity isn't accepted, then the author could be wrong. \n\nIn summary, the author's problem is with the frequency of mentions rather than the sexuality itself. They tried to address it but were met with resistance. Whether they're in the wrong depends on the balance between respecting individual identity and personal boundaries. The answer might hinge on whether the author's request was reasonable and respectful, and if the individuals overreacted.\n"
