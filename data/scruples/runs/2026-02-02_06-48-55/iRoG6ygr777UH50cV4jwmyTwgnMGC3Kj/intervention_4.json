However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for not caring about gay pride and being annoyed by others being openly gay.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they met two gay people who kept emphasizing their sexuality in conversation. The author says they don't have an issue with gay people but find the constant mention of being gay annoying. They tried to hint at it, then stated their feelings, and were called homophobic. Now they're asking if they're the asshole here.\n\nI need to evaluate if the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the key points. The author's problem isn't with the people being gay but with how often they mention it. The author claims they don't have a problem with being gay but wants them to keep it to themselves. However, the friends might feel that the author's request is an attempt to invalidate or ignore their identity. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, LGBTQ+ individuals often face societal pressure to be closeted or not to be open about their identity. When someone is constantly mentioning their sexuality, especially in every sentence, it could be a way of asserting their identity or dealing with their own insecurities. The author's discomfort might stem from not being used to such open discussions, but that doesn't necessarily make the author wrong. However, the friends might feel that the author is being dismissive or judgmental by requesting them to stop mentioning it so much. \n\nThe author also faced backlash, being called homophobic, which suggests that the friends felt their identity was being attacked. Even if the author didn't mean to be, the way they expressed their discomfort might have come across as invalidating. The key here is that the author's request could be seen as wanting the friends to hide a core part of who they are, which is a common issue faced by LGBTQ+ individuals. \n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't opposing being gay; they just find the constant mention of it annoying. But in social interactions, people often share aspects of their identity. If the friends are doing it in a way that's overwhelming, the author has a right to express discomfort. However, the line is thin here. The author's approach might not be the best, but whether they're entirely in the wrong?\n\nI think the answer depends on perspective. The author isn't being hostile towards being gay, just annoyed by the frequency. The friends might feel their identity is being minimized. The author's actions could be seen as wanting the friends to conform to the author's comfort level rather than accepting them fully. Given that, the friends' reaction of labeling the author as homophobic might be an overreaction, but the author's request isn't entirely without merit. However, in the context of acceptance and respecting others' identities, the author's stance might be seen as inconsiderate. So, the author might be in the wrong for not fully accepting the friends' need to express their identity openly. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
