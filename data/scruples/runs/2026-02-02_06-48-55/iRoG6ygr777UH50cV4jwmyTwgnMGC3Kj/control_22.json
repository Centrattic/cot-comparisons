However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The scenario is about someone who doesn't like their friends constantly mentioning their sexuality.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the situation. The author meets two gay people and initially likes them. But then they start feeling uncomfortable because the friends mention their sexuality frequently. The author tries to hint at this, then directly states their feelings but gets accused of being homophobic despite saying they accept them. The question is whether the author is wrong for not caring about gay pride and wanting the friends to stop mentioning it so often.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about respecting boundaries and not making others uncomfortable. The author clearly states they don't have an issue with being gay but find the constant mentions annoying. However, the friends might feel that sharing their identity is important to them. The author's problem isn't with the friends' sexuality but with how often they mention it. \n\nBut wait, personal boundaries are important. If someone is uncomfortable with how much another person talks about their identity, maybe they should communicate that. However, the author was told they were homophobic. The friends might feel that bringing up their sexuality is a normal part of their identity and that the author's discomfort is actually a form of judgment or microaggression. \n\nOn the other hand, everyone has the right to set their own boundaries. If the author is not big on discussing sexuality and finds the constant mentions intrusive, maybe they have a right to ask for space. But the issue might be how the author communicated this. Did they do it respectfully? The author tried to hint first, which is good, but then directly stated their feelings. However, if the friends took offense, maybe the author wasn't clear enough about accepting them despite their sexuality. \n\nAnother angle: the friends might feel that their identity is being minimized or that the author is not supportive. The author says they don't have an issue with being gay, but the friends might perceive the author's discomfort as a problem with their identity. Also, the author's mention of not supporting gay pride could be seen as not being fully accepting. But the author clarifies that they don't have an issue with gay people, just the frequency of mentioning it. \n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, wanting to avoid discussions about something that someone else feels is important can be seen as dismissive. But the author is not rejecting the friends for being gay; they're just uncomfortable with the frequency. However, the friends might feel entitled to express their identity freely. The author's approach might have been wrong in that they didn't respect the friends' need to share their identity, even if it's annoying. \n\nBut the author is also allowed to set boundaries. The problem is that the friends were making the author uncomfortable. Maybe a better approach would be to address it without making it about the friends' identity. However, the friends might feel that their identity is being policed. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, people should be allowed to express their identity without fear of judgment. If the author is uncomfortable with that, it might be their own issue. But it's also okay for people to set boundaries in friendships. However, if the friends felt called out for their identity, that's a problem. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because they were trying to suppress their friends' expression of identity, even if their intention was just to avoid discomfort. The friends have the right to discuss their identity as part of who they are, and the author's reaction, even if well-intentioned, could be seen as invalidating that. Therefore, the answer is A (author is in the wrong).\n"
