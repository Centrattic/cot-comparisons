However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them. (Even though I /clearly/ said I do accept them for their sexuality. I would just appreciate it if they didn't annoyingly mention it ever few minutes!

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA question is in the wrong. The scenario is about someone who doesn't like how their gay friends keep mentioning their sexuality and found it uncomfortable. They tried to hint and then directly told them to stop, but were called homophobic. The options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the core issue here. The author is okay with gay people but doesn't want to hear about their sexuality all the time. They felt the friends were making it \"painfully obvious\" and felt uncomfortable. They tried to address it, but their friends took offense, labeling them as homophobic. The author claims they just want to keep it private and don't support gay pride, but still accept people for who they are.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and what's considered acceptable. People have the right to their own views, but there's a difference between not supporting a cause and being discriminatory. Homophobia involves prejudice against LGBTQ+ individuals. The author says they don't have an issue with gay people and accept them, but the friends might have interpreted the comments as invalidating or uncomfortable for them. \n\nWhen someone is part of a marginalized group, they might have a lower threshold for comments that could be seen as dismissive of their identity. The author's friends might be trying to be open about their identity, which is a personal choice, and the author's discomfort in that situation could be seen as not respecting their friends' needs. \n\nAlso, the author mentioned they tried to hint at it but it didn't work, so they told them their beliefs. The friends felt attacked, even if the author said they accept them. The key here is whether the author's request for the friends to stop mentioning their sexuality is a reasonable boundary. \n\nHowever, the friends might feel that their identity is an essential part of who they are, and the author's discomfort could be seen as invalidating that part of their identity. Even if the author is not outwardly discriminatory, the way the author expressed their discomfort could be perceived as judgmental. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong: The author's actions (asking for the friends to not mention their sexuality) could be seen as infringing on the friends' right to express their identity. The friends might feel that the author is not fully accepting of them if they are being told to hide an important part of themselves. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might believe they are within their right to set boundaries about personal topics. But in this context, the friends might see the author's behavior as not being supportive, even if the author isn't discriminatory. \n\nSo, the answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong (A) because their actions, though based on personal discomfort, might be considered disrespectful to the friends' identity. However, some might argue that the friends overreacted. But given the AITA context and the emphasis on respecting others' identities, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
