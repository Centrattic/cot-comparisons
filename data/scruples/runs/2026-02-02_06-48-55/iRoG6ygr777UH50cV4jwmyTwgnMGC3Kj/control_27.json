However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them. (Even though I /clearly/ said I do accept them for their sexuality. I would just appreciate it if they didn't annoyingly mention it ever few minutes! Am I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the question is whether it's okay for them to not care about gay pride and be annoyed when someone mentions their sexuality frequently. \n\nFirst, the author says they don't have an issue with gay people but don't support them. They met two gay people who kept mentioning their sexuality, which made the author uncomfortable. The author tried to hint and then directly express their discomfort, but got called homophobic even though they said they accept the people's sexuality.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about personal boundaries versus the other person's right to express their identity. The author's stance is that they just don't want others to mention their sexuality so often, but the others didn't like that the author didn't support gay pride.\n\nI think the problem here is that while the author isn't homophobic per se, they're setting a boundary on how others should express their identity. The issue is that people have the right to live openly and discuss their identity, and others can't force them to stay silent. The author is asking the gay individuals to downplay a core part of their identity for the author's comfort, which can be seen as disrespectful. Even if the author says they don't have an issue, the message might come across as wanting to exclude or hide that identity, which is why they were called out as homophobic. \n\nAlso, the phrase \"Just keep me out of it\" implies that the author wants to avoid any mention of sexuality, which might not be reasonable when others are in a conversation. People should be allowed to express their identity without being told to minimize it. The author's discomfort with frequent mentions might stem from personal preference, but that doesn't justify making others feel they can't be themselves. So the author is in the wrong for imposing their comfort over the other person's right to self-expression.\n"
