However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is that the author met two gay people who kept mentioning their sexuality a lot, which made the author uncomfortable. The author tried to hint they didn't want that and then directly stated their feelings, leading to being called homophobic.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author says they don't have an issue with gay people but just don't want them to mention their sexuality so much. They were called homophobic, which the author argues they aren't. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nThe main debate here is about the right to express one's identity versus the other person's discomfort. In many places, being gay is a protected identity, and individuals have the right to express their identity openly. If someone feels that their identity is being overemphasized, but the person is just being themselves, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting their identity expression. \n\nHowever, the author isn't opposing their being gay; they just want them to not mention it so much. There's a line between personal boundaries and respecting someone's self-expression. The author tried to communicate their discomfort, which is valid, but the response from the others was to label them as homophobic. The question is whether the author's stance is reasonable. \n\nI think the key here is that while the author might have a right to their comfort level, they also have a responsibility to respect others' identities. If the gay individuals are expressing themselves without harming anyone, the author's discomfort doesn't justify their actions. The author's desire to avoid the topic might be a personal preference, but it's not a right. So, the author might be in the wrong because they're prioritizing their discomfort over the other person's right to express their identity. \n\nBut wait, the author did clarify they don't have an issue with being gay. They just don't want it mentioned constantly. Maybe the issue is about sensitivity. The author could have handled it differently, but does that make them the asshole? If they're being honest about their feelings, but in a way that doesn't attack the person's identity, maybe not. However, if their reaction is seen as invalidating the other person's experience, then they are in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because the problem stems from the author's discomfort with the other person's expression of their identity, not the identity itself. The author's request to not mention it is within their personal boundaries, but others have the right to express who they are. The author's actions, while not rooted in hate, might still be dismissive of the other person's needs to be open about their identity. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
