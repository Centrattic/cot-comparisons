However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them.

Am I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about someone not caring about gay pride and getting upset when their friends are too open about their sexuality. The person says they have no issue with gay people but find the constant mention of being gay annoying. They tried to hint and then directly tell their friends to stop, but got called homophobic. The user thinks the author is wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's friends are openly gay, which is their right. The author is uncomfortable with how often their sexuality is mentioned. The friends might feel that their identity is important and should be shared. The author's issue isn't with the friends' sexuality itself but the frequency of mentioning it. The friends took offense, seeing it as homophobia even after the author said they accept them. \n\nThe main question is whether the author is wrong. If someone is expressing their identity and the other person finds it uncomfortable, but the problem lies in the frequency rather than the expression itself, maybe the author is being overly sensitive. However, the friends might feel that their identity is being minimized or that the author isn't accepting because they don't support gay pride. The author's stance is \"just keep me out of it,\" but expecting others to not mention their identity might be unrealistic. People often share aspects of their identity naturally in conversations. \n\nAlso, the author tried to hint and then be direct, which is their right to set boundaries. However, the friends might see that as rejecting their identity. The author isn't denying their friends' identity but is bothered by the constant references. It's a bit of a gray area. The friends might feel they have the right to express their identity, and the author's discomfort could stem from not wanting to engage with that aspect. But if the author isn't supporting gay pride, maybe they should have considered their own stance before becoming friends. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, being openly gay is acceptable, and others should accept that. The author's problem isn't with the friends being gay but with how they express it. It's possible the author is in the wrong for expecting others to hide their identity, even if it's a personal preference. But the friends overreacted by labeling the author as homophobic without considering their intent. However, the author's approach of setting boundaries might not be wrong, but the friends' reactions could be valid if they feel their identity is being dismissed. \n\nOverall, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because they expressed their discomfort respectfully. But the expectation that others should avoid mentioning their identity could be seen as invalidating their friends' experiences. It's a complex situation where both sides have some issues, but the friends' reaction might have been too harsh once the author clarified their acceptance. However, the author's initial stance of not supporting gay pride might have set up a conflict. So maybe the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because they're not accepting the friends' identity expression, which is a fundamental right. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) if they're just setting boundaries. But considering the friends' right to express their identity, A might be the correct choice.\n"
