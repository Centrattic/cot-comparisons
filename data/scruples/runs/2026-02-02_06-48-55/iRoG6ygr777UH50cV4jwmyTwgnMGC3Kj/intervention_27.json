However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them. (Even though I /clearly/ said I do accept them for their sexuality. I would just appreciate it if they didn't annoyingly mention it ever few minutes! Am I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not caring about gay pride and being put off by their friends constantly mentioning their sexuality.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the scenario. The author met two gay people and initially liked them but then started disliking them because they kept emphasizing their gayness. The author tried to hint they were being too vocal but was called homophobic when they stated their views. Now, the question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nThe key points here are the author's stance and actions. The author says they don't have an issue with gay people but don't support gay pride. They feel the friends are too loud about it, leading to discomfort. The friends reacted negatively, calling them homophobic despite the author's clear statement of acceptance.\n\nFrom a social justice perspective, it's important to recognize that people have the right to express their identity without fear of judgment. If someone is being true to themselves and their identity, others shouldn't feel they need to censor that. However, if the author is genuinely uncomfortable, maybe they need to consider if their expectations are too low. But the author is not opposing their sexuality; they're just not interested in it being a constant topic. \n\nBut the way the author approached it might be problematic. They tried to subtly hint first, then directly stated their beliefs. Even though they said they accept them, the friends felt targeted. The author's expectation that others should keep their identity private might be the issue. In many cultures, it's considered okay to be open about one's identity, so the friends might not have a problem with how they're expressing themselves. The author's intolerance of that expression, even if they don't have issues with the people themselves, could be seen as the problem. \n\nAlso, the friends' reaction of calling them homophobic might be an overreaction, but the author's stance of not supporting gay pride and wanting them to keep it to themselves could be viewed as not fully accepting them. Acceptance isn't just about not opposing but also about not making others feel they need to hide part of who they are. So the author's request might infringe on the friends' right to express their identity freely. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because they're imposing their discomfort on others' expression of identity, even if they claim not to have issues with the people themselves. Their actions could be seen as contributing to a hostile environment for the friends to be authentic.\n"
