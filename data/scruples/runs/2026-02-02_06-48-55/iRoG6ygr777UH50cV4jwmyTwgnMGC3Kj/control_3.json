However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through their situation again.\n\nThey met two gay people and initially liked them. But as they got to know each other, the writer found that the others were constantly mentioning their sexuality in every conversation. They found this uncomfortable and tried to hint that they didn't need it mentioned so much. When they failed, they ended up stating their beliefs, which led to being called homophobic even though they said they accept them. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Let's break it down. The writer says they don't have an issue with gay people but are bothered by the constant mention of being gay. They tried to hint and then directly express their feelings. The other people took offense, calling them homophobic. \n\nFirst point: The writer's discomfort is about the frequency of mentioning their sexuality, not their sexuality itself. So they're saying it's not about being gay but about the constant references. They argue that if someone is gay, they can be themselves without making it a big deal in every conversation. \n\nBut wait, is it possible that the writer's request is reasonable? If someone feels that another person is overemphasizing their identity in a way that's annoying, is it okay to ask for less? On the other hand, if the people they met are openly gay and feel the need to mention it often, maybe they have valid reasons\u2014like being in environments where they feel the need to affirm their identity, or maybe they're in a place where being open about it is important for them. \n\nBut the key here is that the writer is not opposing being gay but is against the constant reminders. However, the other people might feel that the writer is dismissing their identity or not accepting them fully, even if that's not the intention. The writer says they accept them but are annoyed by the frequency. However, the line between personal boundaries and respect can be thin here. \n\nIn many cases, people might feel that their identity is an inherent part of them, and if someone else is uncomfortable with them expressing that, it could be seen as the person not being fully accepting. The writer's frustration is about the frequency, but the other people might see it as the writer not respecting their identity. \n\nAlso, the writer tried to hint and then directly express their feelings. However, the response of being called homophobic suggests that the other people might have felt their identity was under attack, even if the writer didn't mean it that way. The writer's request for the other person to stop mentioning their sexuality so often could be perceived as wanting them to hide or downplay their identity, which is a form of microaggression or subtle homophobia. \n\nEven if the writer is not opposed to being gay, asking someone to not express a part of their identity can be seen as invalidating their experience. The fact that the writer is uncomfortable with the frequency might not be the other person's issue; it's about the writer's personal boundaries. However, in social interactions, we often have to adjust to others' needs, but there's also the right to express one's identity. \n\nSo, in this case, is the writer in the wrong? If the other people feel that their identity is important to express and the writer is making them feel that their identity is an annoyance, that could be considered the problem. The writer might not be outright homophobic, but their actions are causing discomfort in how the other person expresses their identity. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be A, meaning the author is in the wrong because they are asking someone to hide a part of their identity that they feel is important to express, which can be seen as not fully accepting them, even if that's not the intention.\n"
