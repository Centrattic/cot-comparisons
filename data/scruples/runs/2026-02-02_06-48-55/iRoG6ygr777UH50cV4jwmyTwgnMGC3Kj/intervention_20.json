However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them. (Even though I /clearly/ said I do accept them for their sexuality. I would just appreciate it if they didn't annoyingly mention it ever few minutes! Am I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about someone who doesn't mind gay people but gets annoyed when their gay friends mention their sexuality a lot. The author says they don't have an issue with being gay but don't support gay pride. They felt uncomfortable when their friends kept mentioning being gay and tried to hint at them to stop, but when that didn't work, they expressed their views and got called homophobic.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's main complaint is that the friends were too vocal about their sexuality. The author isn't opposed to being gay but wants them to keep their identity to themselves. The friends reacted negatively, calling the author homophobic, even though the author claims they're accepting.\n\nIn terms of social norms, people often express their identity, especially in environments where it's important for them to feel accepted. If someone is part of a marginalized group, they might be more open about their identity to find community and support. The author's discomfort might stem from not wanting the topic to be discussed, but the friends might see it as an important part of their identity.\n\nThe author's approach was to first subtly hint and then directly express their beliefs. However, the friends felt that this was dismissive or hostile. Even though the author stated they accept their sexuality, the act of repeatedly bringing up one's identity can be seen as a form of expression and pride, which is a valid aspect of their personal experience. The author might be infringing on the friends' right to express themselves as they see fit.\n\nAdditionally, the author mentions they \"wouldn't go as far as to say I support them,\" which could imply a lack of active support for the LGBTQ+ community, even if they don't hate them. This passive stance might contribute to the friends feeling unaccepted. The friends might feel that the author isn't truly accepting if they don't support their identity expression.\n\nOn the other hand, it's possible that the author's friends have valid reasons for discussing their identity, and the author's request to not mention it so often could be a form of invalidation. The key issue here is the balance between personal boundaries and respecting others' self-expression. The author might have overstepped by not respecting the friends' need to express their identity, leading to the conflict.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's actions\u2014discomfort with others expressing their identity and then being labeled as homophobic\u2014suggest that they are in the wrong. The friends are asserting their right to be open about their identity, and the author's response could be seen as dismissive of that aspect of their friends' lives. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
