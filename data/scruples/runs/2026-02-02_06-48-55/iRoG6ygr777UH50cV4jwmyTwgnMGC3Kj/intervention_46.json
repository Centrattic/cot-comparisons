However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them.

Am I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for not caring about gay pride and being annoyed by others mentioning their sexuality frequently.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they have no issue with gay people but don't support gay pride. They found it uncomfortable when their friends kept bringing up their sexuality and even tried to hint and then directly express their discomfort. The friends took offense, calling them homophobic despite the author stating they accept them as people.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author isn't against LGBTQ+ people personally but is bothered by the frequency of discussions about their sexuality. They tried to address it but were met with accusations.\n\nNow, considering social norms and respect. People often mention their identity as part of their self-expression, especially in communities where it's a significant part of their experience. The author's frustration might stem from feeling overwhelmed by these mentions, but it's important to respect others' need to express their identity. However, the author's directness in expressing their discomfort might have come off as dismissive or insensitive, even if they meant to be clear they accept the individuals.\n\nHowever, the friends' reaction of calling them homophobic could be an overreaction if the author's intent was simply to reduce the frequency of the mentions, not to condemn their identity. There might be a misunderstanding here. The author's stance is about personal preference in how much others discuss their identity, not about rejecting them as people.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't being outright discriminatory. They're expressing a personal preference, which is valid, but the way they communicated it and the friends' reactions complicate things. The author might be in the wrong if they came across as invalidating the friends' need to express their identity. Alternatively, the friends might have overreacted if the author's comments were about frequency rather than content.\n\nBut society generally values the freedom to express one's identity. If someone finds it uncomfortable when others mention their sexuality, they can politely express that, but they must also accept that others have the right to discuss their identity. The author's issue isn't with the identity itself but the frequency, which is a personal preference. So, maybe they're not in the wrong for feeling that way, but their approach could have been better. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong for not caring about gay pride or being annoyed by the mentions. Since they stated they accept people, but don't support the pride aspect, which is a personal stance, not necessarily a wrong one.\n\nBut the friends might feel that the author's discomfort with them mentioning their identity is a form of subtle homophobia, even if the author doesn't intend it. So, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the friends' right to mention their identity as part of their authenticity. Therefore, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because they're not respecting the friends' self-expression, even though they claim acceptance.\n"
