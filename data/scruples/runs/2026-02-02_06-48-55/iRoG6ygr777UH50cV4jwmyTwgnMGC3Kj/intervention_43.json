However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them. (Even though I /clearly/ said I do accept them for their sexuality. I would just appreciate it if they didn't annoyingly mention it ever few minutes! Am I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author met two gay people who kept emphasizing their sexuality, making the author uncomfortable. The author tried to hint they shouldn't mention it so much, then got called homophobic when they expressed their views.\n\nFirst, the author says they don't have an issue with gay people and just want them to keep their sexuality to themselves. The key point here is the author's discomfort with the frequent mentions of being gay. The problem is that the author is uncomfortable with others' expressions of their identity, even though they claim to accept them. \n\nIn many modern contexts, the idea is that people should feel free to express their identity without fear of judgment. If the author is okay with people being gay but not okay with them openly acknowledging it, that's a form of closeted homophobia or at least problematic. The author's main issue isn't with the people's sexuality but with how they express it, which could be seen as invalidating their right to be open about who they are.\n\nAlso, the author tried to hint and then directly state their preferences, leading to conflict. The friends felt the author was being homophobic, even if the author didn't intend it. The author's stance that they just want people to \"keep me out of it\" suggests a desire for others to remain silent about their identity, which can be seen as imposing their own comfort over the other person's right to self-expression.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is likely in the wrong because their discomfort leads them to disapprove of others expressing their sexuality, even if they don't outright oppose it. The answer would be A.\n"
