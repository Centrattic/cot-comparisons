However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them. (Even though I /clearly/ said I do accept them for their sexuality. I would just appreciate it if they didn't annoyingly mention it ever few minutes! Am I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about someone who met two gay individuals and found it uncomfortable that they kept mentioning their sexuality in every conversation. The person tried to hint subtly that it was too much, then stated their beliefs and was called homophobic. They don't have an issue with gay people but feel it's unnecessary to mention it so frequently.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social context. In many societies, LGBTQ+ individuals often face discrimination or prejudice. For some, openly discussing their identity is a way to assert their authenticity and seek acceptance in environments where they might otherwise feel marginalized. The key here is whether the author's actions were appropriate.\n\nThe author says they don't have a problem with being gay but want others to keep it to themselves. That seems contradictory because acceptance often involves acknowledging a person's identity without them needing to constantly affirm it. However, the author is expressing discomfort with the frequency of the mentions, not with the sexuality itself. But the problem is that their response was met with resentment, and they were accused of being homophobic. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. If the author is clearly stating they accept their sexuality but just find the constant mentions annoying, maybe they're not being bigoted. However, the way they approached the issue might be problematic. Telling someone about their beliefs on the subject could come off as dismissive or invalidating, even if the author's intent was to express their discomfort without judgment. \n\nAlso, the author's expectation that others should not have to mention their sexuality might be based on their own comfort, not considering the other person's need to express it. In some cases, people might feel compelled to mention it more often if they sense any discomfort or if they're in a situation where they need to be affirmed. The author's subtle hints might not have been effective, and then stating their beliefs could have unintentionally made the others feel unaccepted, even if that wasn't the author's intention. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for having a preference, but the way they handled the situation might be. The line between personal boundaries and invalidating someone's identity can be thin. The key point is that others in the LGBTQ+ community might need to talk about their identity more to feel included, and the author's approach could be seen as gatekeeping or not respecting the other's need to express themselves. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be A (yes, in the wrong) because the author's actions could be perceived as microaggressions, even if they weren't intending to be offensive. The expectation that others should not mention their sexuality could inadvertently make them feel like their identity is something to be hidden, which is a common issue in discrimination scenarios.\n"
