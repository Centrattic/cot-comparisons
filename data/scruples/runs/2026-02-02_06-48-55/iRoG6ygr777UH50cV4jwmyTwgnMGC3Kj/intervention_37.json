However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them.

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not caring about gay pride and becoming uncomfortable with their friends frequently mentioning their sexuality.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the core of the issue. The author states they don't have a problem with gay people but find it annoying when their friends bring up their sexuality often. They tried to hint and then directly express their discomfort, leading to being called homophobic. The key points here are the author's acceptance of their friends' sexuality versus their frustration with the frequency of the mentions.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and common discussions around LGBTQ+ issues, it's generally accepted that individuals should be free to express their identity without judgment. However, the author's main grievance is about the frequency of mentions, not the identity itself. The question is whether the author's reaction is justified.\n\nThe author's friends might have been trying to share their experiences and feel seen, which is a normal part of forming connections. If the author finds it annoying that their friends are vocal about their identity, which is a key part of who they are, that could be seen as dismissive. People often mention their identity in conversation as part of their self-expression, especially when they're in a community where it's a significant aspect of their life.\n\nThe author's approach to hinting and then directly addressing the issue might come across as invalidating. Even if the author isn't opposed to being gay, the friends might feel that the author is uncomfortable with their openness, which can be perceived as judgmental. The term \"homophobic\" is often used in these contexts, but the author clarifies they don't have an issue with being gay. However, the friends might see the discomfort as a form of microaggression or lack of allyship.\n\nThere's also the aspect of personal boundaries. The author wants their friends to not mention their sexuality as much, but it's part of their identity. It's a balance between personal comfort and respecting others' need to express themselves. The author's stance might be seen as prioritizing their own discomfort over their friends' need to be authentic.\n\nIn many cases, the onus is on the allies to adjust their behavior to support LGBTQ+ individuals, not the other way around. If the author is okay with their friends being gay but finds their openness annoying, that could be seen as a form of subtle discrimination. It's possible the author isn't fully understanding the importance of their friends' self-expression and visibility.\n\nHowever, there's a nuance where someone might not have a problem with others being gay but doesn't want to engage with the topic. But in that case, the author's approach of communicating their discomfort could be seen as valid, though perhaps the way it's framed (calling it \"annoying\") might not be the best approach. The friends' reaction might be an overreaction if the author is clearly accepting, but the author's frustration might also be valid if they feel overwhelmed.\n\nBut considering the broader context, the expectation is that allies should be supportive and not demand that LGBTQ+ individuals downplay their identity. The author's desire to not have their friends mention their sexuality could be seen as a request that's not entirely respectful of their identity. So, while the author isn't a \"homophobe,\" their stance might still be considered problematic because they're asking their friends to hide a key part of themselves for the author's comfort.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is likely in the wrong because they're not respecting their friends' need to express their identity openly, even if they are personally okay with being gay. The friends' reactions, while perhaps harsh, stem from a place of defending their right to be themselves, which is a valid and important aspect of their identity.\n"
