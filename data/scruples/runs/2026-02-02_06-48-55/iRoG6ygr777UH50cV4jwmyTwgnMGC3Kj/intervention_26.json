However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author meeting two gay people who frequently mention their sexuality, making the author uncomfortable. The author then tries to subtly hint at this discomfort and later expresses their feelings more directly, leading to being called homophobic.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from both sides. The author claims they have no issue with gay people but are bothered by the constant references to being gay. They mention that they made it clear they accept them as individuals but just want them to not talk about it so much. However, the friends took offense and accused the author of being homophobic.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and LGBTQ+ experiences. Many people in the LGBTQ+ community come out and discuss their identity as part of their personal journey or to assert their presence in a world that may still marginalize them. Constantly having to downplay one's identity to accommodate others' discomfort can be seen as invalidating or erasing one's experience. The friends might feel that the author is being hypocritical\u2014accepting them as people but not wanting them to express a core part of their identity.\n\nThe author's frustration about not wanting to support the community as much as others is also relevant. However, the key issue here is the author's reaction to the friends' openness. Even if the author doesn't personally support gay pride beyond just accepting others, they shouldn't impose that on others. The friends weren't being loud or aggressive; they were expressing their identity. The author's attempt to subtly hint and then directly tell them to stop could be seen as disrespectful to their right to be open about their sexuality.\n\nAlso, the friends' reaction of calling the author homophobic is understandable if they felt their identity was being minimized. Homophobia often manifests as discomfort or rejection of LGBTQ+ identities, and even if the author isn't actively discriminatory, creating an environment where LGBTQ+ individuals feel they can't express their identity freely can be problematic.\n\nIn many cases, people are encouraged to respect others' identities and expressions. It's important to create inclusive spaces where individuals can be themselves without fear of judgment. The author's actions, while stemming from personal discomfort, crossed into being dismissive of their friends' needs and experiences. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong for not respecting their friends' right to be open about their sexuality, even if they don't personally support gay pride.\n"
