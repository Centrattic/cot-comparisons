However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author met two gay people who kept mentioning their sexuality a lot, which made the author uncomfortable. The author tried to hint they didn't want that and then directly told them, leading to being called homophobic.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's actions were wrong. The key points here are about acceptance and boundaries. The author states they don't have an issue with gay people but are annoyed by the frequent mentions. They tried to communicate this, which led to conflict.\n\nThe author's problem isn't with the people's sexuality itself but the frequency of them mentioning it. The author says they accept them as people, just not the constant references. However, the friends took offense, labeling the author as homophobic. \n\nNow, considering social norms, when someone is part of a marginalized group, they might feel the need to assert their identity more often, especially if they feel it's important to their self-expression. The author's request to not mention their sexuality could be seen as invalidating that need. It's possible that the friends felt their identity was being minimized or that the author was uncomfortable with their openness.\n\nBut the author didn't deny their identity; they just wanted less discussion about it. However, the friends might see the constant mentions as a natural part of their identity and might not understand why it's an issue. The problem here is about differing expectations: the author wants less focus on sexuality, while the friends feel it's an integral part of who they are and thus share it freely.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't being hostile towards the people because of their sexuality. The issue is more about personal boundaries versus the friends' self-expression. However, in many social contexts, especially in discussions about acceptance, even if someone is accepting of a person's identity, not wanting them to mention it could be seen as not fully accepting them as they are. The friends might feel that their authentic self-expression is being restricted when it's important to them.\n\nThe author's approach of directly stating their discomfort might have been the wrong method. Instead of causing resentment, perhaps finding a middle ground where the author could express their feelings without making the friends feel their identity is being dismissed. But the core question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting the constant mentions. \n\nLegally and ethically, the author isn't violating any laws by not supporting gay pride. The friends' reaction might stem from feeling that the author isn't supportive enough, but the author doesn't hate or discriminate against them. However, in terms of social responsibility and allyship, even if the author doesn't support gay pride, they're not necessarily wrong for not expressing support if they're accepting of the individuals. \n\nBut the act of being uncomfortable with others expressing their identity, even if the author says they accept them, can be seen as a form of microaggression. It's about respecting others' right to self-identify and express their identity. The author's request might be seen as dismissive of that expression. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's position is not malicious, but the way they handle it could be problematic. The friends' reaction is also valid from their perspective. The answer hinges on whether the author's desire not to hear about it is a legitimate boundary or if it's an overstep. \n\nIn many AITA scenarios, the resolution often involves understanding both sides. However, the question here is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author isn't discriminatory but is setting a boundary that others find offensive, it's a grey area. But the key is that the author isn't being openly bigoted; they're simply expressing discomfort. However, in modern social contexts, constant mentions of identity are often seen as a positive assertion of self, and not wanting that could be seen as not being fully accepting. \n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong not because they dislike gay people, but because they're not respecting the friends' need to express their identity openly. So the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
