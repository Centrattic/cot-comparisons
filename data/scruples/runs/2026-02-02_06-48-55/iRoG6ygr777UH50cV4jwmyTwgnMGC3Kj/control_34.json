However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author met two gay people and found them annoying because they mentioned their sexuality often. The author tried to hint and then told them directly that they don't need to mention it so much, leading to being called homophobic.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author states they don't have an issue with gay people but don't support them. They feel uncomfortable when the others make their sexuality obvious. The main conflict arises from the author expressing their discomfort to the point where they are labeled as homophobic.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong for not wanting others to mention their sexuality so frequently. Let's break this down. The author is not opposing homosexuality itself but is uncomfortable with the frequency of mentions. They do accept the people as individuals, just not the constant references. \n\nFrom a social perspective, people often express their identity as part of their authentic self-expression. If someone is being upfront about their sexuality, that's their right. The author's issue isn't with the existence of gay people but with how they choose to present themselves. However, the author's response was to voice their discomfort, which led to conflict. \n\nNow, considering the labels of homophobic. Homophobia is rooted in hatred or fear of LGBTQ+ individuals. The author claims they don't have an issue with gay people, so being called homophobic might be a mislabeling. However, the act of requesting others to change their behavior to make oneself comfortable could be seen as a form of microaggression or invalidating their identity expression. \n\nBut the key here is the author's intent. They are not opposing the right to be gay, just the frequency of mentions. They are not targeting the people's identity itself but the expression of it. However, the way they communicated this might have been insensitive, leading to the others feeling that their identity is being policed. \n\nAlso, the author's boundary is about respecting others' space. They want to keep their interactions focused on the person rather than their sexuality. But in doing so, they might be asking others to suppress an aspect of their identity to accommodate the author's preferences. \n\nSociety generally encourages people to be themselves, and while it's okay to set boundaries, it's also important to respect others' right to express their identity. The author might not be in the wrong for feeling uncomfortable, but they are in the wrong for expecting others to change their behavior to fit their comfort level. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because they are imposing their discomfort on others' self-expression, even if they claim not to have a problem with being gay. The act of asking others to downplay their identity can be seen as a form of intolerance, even if unintentional.\n"
