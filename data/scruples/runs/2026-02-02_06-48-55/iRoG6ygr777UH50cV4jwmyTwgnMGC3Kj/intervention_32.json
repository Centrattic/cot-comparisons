However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them. (Even though I /clearly/ said I do accept them for their sexuality. I would just appreciate it if they didn't annoyingly mention it ever few minutes! Am I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about someone who doesn't care about gay pride and finds it annoying when their friends, who are gay, bring up their sexuality too much. They tried to hint and then directly tell them to stop, but were called homophobic. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author says they have no issue with gay people but are annoyed by the constant references. They mention they don't support gay pride but just want to be left out. The friends felt they were being homophobic even after the author said they accept them.\n\nHmm. The key points here are acceptance versus discomfort. The author is not opposing LGBTQ+ rights per se but is bothered by the frequency of mentions. However, the friends took offense. The author's actions\u2014hinting and then directly stating their discomfort\u2014might be seen as invalidating the friends' identity or making them feel that their sexuality is a negative thing. Even if the author meant to be neutral, the friends felt unaccepted. \n\nIn terms of social norms, while it's important to respect others' identities, it's also okay to set boundaries. But when the author expressed their discomfort, they were met with resentment. The problem here might be that the author didn't fully appreciate the friends' need to express their identity, which can be important for them to feel authentic. The friends might feel that their being gay is a significant part of who they are, and not wanting to hear about it could be seen as dismissive.\n\nAlso, the author's approach\u2014subtle hints and then direct communication\u2014might not have been the best way to address the issue. It's possible that the friends felt the author was being judgmental, even if that wasn't the intent. The line between personal boundaries and respecting others' expression can be thin here.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because their actions, even if well-intentioned, caused discomfort and were perceived as homophobic. The friends are within their rights to express their identity, and the author's reaction, while about personal space, might infringe on the friends' right to be themselves. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
