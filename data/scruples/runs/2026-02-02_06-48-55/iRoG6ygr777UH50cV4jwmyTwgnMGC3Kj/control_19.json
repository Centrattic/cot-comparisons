However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them. (Even though I /clearly/ said I do accept them for their sexuality. I would just appreciate it if they didn't annoyingly mention it ever few minutes! Am I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not caring about gay pride and being annoyed by two gay friends constantly mentioning their sexuality.\n\nFirst, the author states they don't have an issue with gay people but find it uncomfortable when their gay friends bring up their sexuality so frequently. They tried subtly hinting and then explaining their feelings, but were called homophobic. The question is whether the author is wrong for wanting their friends to stop mentioning their sexuality so much.\n\nFrom a social perspective, it's important to respect people's identities. However, the author's issue isn't with the fact that they're gay, but with the frequency of mentioning it. The friends might be expressing pride in their identity, which is a positive thing. The author wants them to stop because it's annoying, which might be a personal preference but could be seen as dismissing their identity. \n\nLaws and ethics say discrimination based on sexual orientation is wrong. However, the author isn't discriminating; they're expressing discomfort with the constant references. Still, telling someone to stop being proud of who they are can be hurtful. The friends might feel invalidated if their identity is downplayed. \n\nThe author's approach\u2014trying to hint and then explaining their stance\u2014is reasonable, but the friends' reaction suggests that the author's words might have been perceived as invalidating their identity, even if the author didn't mean to. The key point is whether the author is wrong for prioritizing their comfort over respecting the friends' self-expression. \n\nIn many cases, respecting someone's identity is considered more important than personal discomfort. So, even if the author's intention is neutral, the act of asking the friends to stop expressing their sexuality so much could be seen as the author being in the wrong. The friends have the right to express their identity without pressure to hide it. Therefore, the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
