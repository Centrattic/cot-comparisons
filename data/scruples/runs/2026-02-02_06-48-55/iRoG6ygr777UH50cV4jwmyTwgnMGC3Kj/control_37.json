I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author met two gay people and started to dislike them because they were constantly mentioning their sexuality. The author says they have no issue with gay people but find the frequent references annoying. They tried to hint that it was too much and when that didn't work, they expressed their beliefs and were called homophobic.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author claims to have no problem with being gay but finds the constant mention of their sexuality uncomfortable. They want others to just keep their personal life private. The friends felt that the author was being homophobic, even though the author says they accept them.\n\nNow, thinking about social norms and respect. People often express their identity openly, especially in communities where it's important to be authentic. If someone is being open about their sexuality, it's part of their identity. The author's issue isn't with the people themselves but with how they express their identity. However, the author's actions led to the friends feeling unaccepted. Even if the author says they accept them, the way they communicated their discomfort might have been perceived as invalidating.\n\nAlso, the author tried to subtly hint at discomfort but then openly stated their beliefs when that didn't work. This escalation could be seen as disrespectful. Even if the author's intention was to stop the mentions, the friends felt targeted. The author might not have considered that for some, discussing their sexuality is a natural part of their identity and they can't be expected to suppress it.\n\nAnother angle: the author is asking others to hide their identity to avoid making them uncomfortable. That could place the burden on the gay individuals to accommodate the author's preferences, which isn't fair. Everyone has the right to express their identity without fear of judgment. The author's request to \"keep me out of it\" implies that the friends' openness is intruding, but it's their own choice to engage in conversations. If the author found the frequency annoying, perhaps they should adjust their own tolerance rather than expecting others to change how they express themselves.\n\nHowever, the author isn't opposing their sexuality; they're just annoyed by the frequency. But the friends felt that the author was being homophobic. The key here is whether the author's request is reasonable. People do mention their identities in conversation, and it's part of being authentic. The author's discomfort might stem from not wanting to engage with that aspect, but others have the right to discuss their lives. The author's actions, even if well-intentioned, might have been insensitive because they didn't take into account how their friends would feel being told to stop expressing their identity.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is in the wrong because they asked others to hide a part of their identity to accommodate their discomfort. Even if their intentions were neutral, the impact was negative on their friends, leading to conflict. The correct answer is A.\n"
