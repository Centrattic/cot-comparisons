However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them.

Am I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is that the author met two gay people and started to dislike them because they were very open about their sexuality, mentioning it in every conversation. The author tried to hint they didn't want that and later stated their beliefs, which led to being called homophobic.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author says they don't have an issue with gay people but get annoyed when their sexuality is mentioned constantly. They tried to subtly hint at the friends to stop, but that didn't work. Then they expressed their beliefs, leading to conflict. \n\nThe author is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for not caring about gay pride and being annoyed by the constant mentions. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nHmm. In terms of ethics, the main issue is about respecting others' identity versus personal boundaries. The friends are expressing their sexuality, which is a fundamental part of who they are. The author is asking them to hide or downplay it, which could be seen as invalidating their identity. Even if the author doesn't have a problem with being gay, expecting others to not mention it might be problematic. \n\nAlso, the author mentions they clearly said they accept them, but the friends perceived it as homophobia. This could be because the author's statements about not caring about gay pride and not wanting to hear about it might come across as dismissive, even if they don't have ill intentions. \n\nFrom a social justice perspective, it's important to support people in expressing their identity without fear. The friends might feel that the author's discomfort and attempts to minimize discussions about their sexuality are a form of microaggression or lack of acceptance. \n\nBut there's also a balance in personal relationships. People have different communication styles and boundaries. However, when it comes to identity, especially one that's often stigmatized, it's generally considered respectful to allow others to express it without pressure. \n\nThe author's approach of trying to hint and then stating their beliefs might not have been effective or considerate. The friends might have felt that the author was being hypocritical\u2014accepting them as people but not wanting them to be open about their sexuality. That duality can be confusing and hurtful. \n\nIn summary, the author's issue stems from personal discomfort with the friends' openness, not with their sexuality itself. However, the expectation that others should not express a core part of their identity can be seen as invalidating. The friends' reaction of calling the author homophobic might be a misunderstanding, but the author's stance could still be seen as lacking support for their identity. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong because they're asking others to suppress their identity, which is a fundamental right, even if the intention is not malicious.\n"
