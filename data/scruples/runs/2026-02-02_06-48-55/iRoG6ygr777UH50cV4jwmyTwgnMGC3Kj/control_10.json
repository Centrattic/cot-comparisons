However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author meeting two gay people who constantly mention their sexuality, making the author uncomfortable. The author tried to hint at them to stop, then directly told them their beliefs, but got accused of being homophobic.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author states they don't have an issue with gay people but find the constant mention of being gay annoying. They tried to communicate this subtly and then directly when that didn't work. The other people took offense, calling the author homophobic despite the author's clarification that they accept their sexuality.\n\nFrom a social perspective, it's important to respect others' identities. However, the author's discomfort seems to stem from how the other people express their identity, not their identity itself. The author isn't opposing LGBTQ+ rights but is asking not to be reminded of it constantly. \n\nBut the problem here is that the author is expressing discomfort with how the other people present their identity, which could be seen as invalidating. Even if the author accepts their sexuality, creating a dynamic where someone's identity makes another person uncomfortable can lead to tension. The author's approach was to set boundaries, but the way they did it might have come across as dismissive or judgmental.\n\nMoreover, the other individuals might feel that their identity is being minimized or that the author is not fully accepting if they express discomfort with the constant reminders. It's possible that the author's communication wasn't clear enough, leading to misunderstandings. However, the core issue is about personal boundaries versus the expression of identity. \n\nIn many social contexts, people have the right to express their identity freely, and others should respect that unless it's causing harm. Here, the author isn't experiencing direct harm but rather discomfort from the frequency of mentions. This might not be a valid reason to ask others to change their behavior, as it's a personal preference rather than a harmful action.\n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong because they're asking others to suppress their identity based on their personal discomfort. However, they are also trying to communicate their feelings. The key is whether the other people's actions were genuinely overstepping or just the author's sensitivity. But in public discussions, people often have the right to mention their identity, so the author's request might not be justified. Hence, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong).\n"
