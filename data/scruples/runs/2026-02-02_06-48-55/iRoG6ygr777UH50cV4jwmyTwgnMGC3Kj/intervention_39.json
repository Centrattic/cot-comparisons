However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them. (Even though I /clearly/ said I do accept them for their sexuality. I would just appreciate it if they didn't annoyingly mention it ever few minutes! Am I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The author says they don't have an issue with gay people but got annoyed because the two people they met kept mentioning their sexuality too much. They tried to hint and then directly state that they were uncomfortable with the constant focus on being gay. The friends took offense, calling them homophobic.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is not opposed to gay people but is bothered by the frequency of their mentioning their sexuality. The key point here is that while the author accepts people's sexuality, their discomfort stems from the frequency of the mentions, not the fact that they're gay. \n\nBut wait, the problem might be how the author communicated this. They tried to hint and then directly told the friends. Even if the author's intention was just to stop the mentions, the friends felt attacked and labeled the author as homophobic. The author explicitly said they accept their sexuality, but the friends didn't believe them. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's issue isn't with the people's sexuality but with how they express it. However, it's not the friends' obligation to avoid mentioning their identity if that's part of who they are. People might mention their identity because it's important to them. The author's request to \"keep me out of it\" might be a way to avoid engaging, which could be seen as dismissive. \n\nThe friends might feel that their identity is being invalidated if others get uncomfortable. Even if the author isn't bigoted, their discomfort could come off as judgmental. The line between personal preference and being inconsiderate can be thin here. \n\nSo, is the author wrong? They might be in the wrong because they're asking others to downplay a core part of their identity to accommodate their discomfort. It's about respecting others' authentic expression versus personal boundaries. The author's actions could be seen as invalidating the friends' need to express their identity, even if the author's intent was neutral. Hence, the answer might be A.\n"
