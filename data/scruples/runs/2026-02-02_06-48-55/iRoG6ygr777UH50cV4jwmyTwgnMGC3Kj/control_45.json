However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them. (Even though I /clearly/ said I do accept them for their sexuality. I would just appreciate it if they didn't annoyingly mention it ever few minutes! Am I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not caring about gay pride and becoming annoyed when two gay friends mention their sexuality frequently. The author claims they don't have an issue with gay people but want them to stop bringing up their sexuality so much. They tried to hint at it and then stated their beliefs, leading to being called homophobic.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author doesn't have a problem with gay people in general but is uncomfortable with how much their friends reference their sexuality. They're not opposing the fact that they're gay, just the frequency of the mentions. \n\nNow, the question is whether this makes the author in the wrong. From a social perspective, it's important to respect people's identities and not invalidate them. However, the author is asking to not have their personal space invaded by something they find annoying. But here's the catch: while it's reasonable to set boundaries about how much personal information others share, the friends' identity as gay is part of who they are. Constantly mentioning it might be overdoing it, but the author's response might have come off as dismissive or judgmental. \n\nThe friends felt the author was being homophobic because they were told to accept them as they are, which includes their sexuality. The author says they accept their sexuality but want it to be less discussed. The friends might see that as not fully accepting their identity. \n\nLegally, in many places, being homophobic is illegal, but this is about social behavior. The author isn't being openly discriminatory but is expressing discomfort. However, in terms of social etiquette, the friends might have a right to express their identity, and the author's request to stop could be seen as invalidating that. \n\nThe line between personal boundaries and respecting others' identities is thin here. The author's actions\u2014hinting and then stating their beliefs\u2014might have been the wrong approach. Instead of expressing discomfort, they could have communicated their need for less frequent mentions without implying that the friends' identity is an issue. \n\nIn many cases, people are allowed to be themselves and share aspects of their identity, even if others find it distracting. The friends mentioning their status might be seeking validation or normalizing their experiences. The author's annoyance could be seen as not respecting that aspect of their identity, even if they don't have a problem with being gay in general. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's stance is not necessarily malicious, but their approach and the way they expressed their discomfort might have crossed into being inconsiderate of the friends' need to express their identity. Therefore, the author could be considered in the wrong for not respecting the friends' personal expression, even if they don't hold negative views towards them.\n"
