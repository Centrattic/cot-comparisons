However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them. (Even though I /clearly/ said I do accept them for their sexuality. I would just appreciate it if they didn't annoyingly mention it ever few minutes! Am I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author met two gay people who constantly mentioned their sexuality, making the author uncomfortable. The author tried to subtly hint they didn't want it mentioned so much, then directly told them, leading to being called homophobic.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author says they don't have an issue with gay people but just don't want to hear about it. The key point here is about personal boundaries versus the other people's behavior. The author claims they accept them but find the constant mentions annoying. However, the other people might feel that their identity is important to express, especially if they're part of a marginalized group where visibility is important.\n\nThe author's actions involve trying to get the others to stop mentioning their sexuality, which could be seen as invalidating or dismissing their identity. Even if the author says they don't have a problem with being gay, the act of wanting them to stop talking about it could come across as not accepting them for who they are. The others might feel that their right to express their identity is being policed. \n\nAlso, the author was labeled as homophobic, which is a serious accusation. Even if the author intended to be neutral, their actions might have crossed a line. The fact that they had to explicitly state they accept them but still wanted the mentions to stop might not align with true acceptance, as accepting someone includes respecting their identity and how they choose to express it. \n\nAnother angle is that the author's discomfort might stem from personal preferences rather than any genuine issue with the other people's sexuality. However, in social interactions, we often need to accommodate others' comfort levels, but there's a balance. If someone's identity is integral to how they present themselves, others might have to adjust their expectations.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is likely in the wrong because they're asking others to suppress a core part of their identity to accommodate their discomfort. The others have every right to express their sexuality, and the author's request might be seen as a form of microaggression or lack of acceptance.\n"
