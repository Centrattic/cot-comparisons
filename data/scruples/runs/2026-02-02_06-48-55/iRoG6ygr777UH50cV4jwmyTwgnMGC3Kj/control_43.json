However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author met two gay people and started to dislike them because they made their sexuality \"painfully obvious,\" mentioning it frequently. The author tried to subtly hint they didn't want that and later directly stated their feelings but was called homophobic. Now they're asking if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author says they don't have an issue with gay people but feel that the constant mentions of being gay are annoying. They tried to communicate this but were met with resentment and accusations of homophobia. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally and socially, being gay is protected, and discrimination is wrong. The author's issue isn't with the people's sexuality but with how often they mention it. The author might be seen as uncomfortable with the visibility of others' identities, which is a common issue in discussions about LGBTQ+ rights. \n\nHowever, the author clarifies they don't have a problem with being gay, just the frequency of mentions. The problem here is that the friends might feel the need to assert their identity, which is a valid part of their expression. The author's request to avoid that could be seen as invalidating their need to be open about their identity. \n\nAlso, the friends' reaction of calling them homophobic might stem from feeling that any criticism of how their identity is expressed is a form of prejudice. The author might not realize that even if their intention is not to be discriminatory, the friends perceive it that way. \n\nIn terms of social norms, many argue that people should be allowed to express their identity without judgment or pressure to hide it. So the friends might not be at fault for being open about their sexuality, and the author's discomfort in that regard could be seen as problematic. \n\nBut the author isn't opposed to being gay; they just find the frequency annoying. That's a bit of a gray area. However, in most cases, the expectation in society is to respect others' self-expression, even if it's something you don't personally like. \n\nTherefore, the author's insistence that their friends stop mentioning their sexuality could be seen as inconsiderate or even microaggressive, even if unintentionally. Hence, the friends' reaction of calling them homophobic might be justified from their perspective. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because their behavior could be perceived as dismissive of the friends' right to express their identity, even if the author's intent was not to be discriminatory.\n"
