      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author of this AITA post is in the wrong. Let me start by breaking down the situation they described.\n\nThe user met two people who are homosexual and initially thought they were lovely. But over time, they started to dislike them because the two people kept making their sexuality painfully obvious, mentioning it in almost every sentence. The author says they don't have an issue with being gay, but they don't support Gay Pride either. They just want people to keep their sexuality to themselves. When they tried to hint that the frequency was too much and later told them their beliefs, they were called homophobic. The user is asking if they're the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author's discomfort stems from others being openly gay in a way they find annoying. They clarify they don't have a problem with being gay, just the constant mentions. The friends reacted negatively, calling them homophobic. The user is defensive, saying they accept the sexuality but just want it not to be brought up so often.\n\nNow, from a standpoint of social norms, being open about one's identity is generally seen as positive, especially for groups that have historically faced discrimination. LGBTQ+ individuals often share their experiences to foster understanding and acceptance. However, the author is frustrated by the frequency. The issue here is whether it's reasonable to expect someone to not mention their identity if the person is uncomfortable with it. \n\nThe author's statement, \"We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it,\" might imply that the author is okay with people being their sexuality but not with others talking about it. But this is a problematic stance because it's invalidating. Everyone has the right to express their identity, and it's not fair to ask someone to hide it if it's a core part of who they are. The author is essentially telling the others that their identity is a burden and should be downplayed, which can be hurtful.\n\nThen there's the part where the author tried to subtly hint at the friends to stop mentioning it. If the friends didn't notice the subtle hints, maybe the author should have communicated more directly, but the problem is that the author's own communication might not be clear. However, the friends' reaction of calling them homophobic is a strong response. The author claims they accept the friends' sexuality, so why the negative reaction? It's possible the friends felt that the author was trying to suppress their identity, even if the author didn't intend that. \n\nBut the core issue is the author's discomfort with the constant mentions. It's possible that the friends are in a space where they feel safe to express themselves, and the author is in their way. The author might be in a minority in their views. The friends might be in a community where being open about their identity is the norm, and the author is not respecting that. \n\nAnother angle is the idea of personal boundaries. The author might feel that the friends are overstepping, but if the friends are open about their identity, it's their right. The author's request to not mention it is essentially asking the friends to hide a part of themselves, which is not acceptable. So, the author is in the wrong because they are asking the friends to suppress their identity, which is a form of discrimination, even if the author doesn't hold negative feelings towards the sexuality itself. \n\nAlso, the author's statement \"I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them\" suggests a lack of support, which can be problematic. Being neutral isn't the same as being accepting. True acceptance includes supporting others' rights and expressions, even if one personally doesn't engage with it. \n\nIn conclusion, the author is likely in the wrong because they are requesting others to hide their identity, which is a core part of who they are. The friends' reactions, while perhaps harsh, are a response to the author's attempts to suppress their identity, which is not acceptable. Therefore, the answer should be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
