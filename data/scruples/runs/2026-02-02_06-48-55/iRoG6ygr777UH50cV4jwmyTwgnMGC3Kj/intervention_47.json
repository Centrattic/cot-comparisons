However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author met two gay people and started to dislike them because they \"made it painfully obvious\" they were gay, mentioning their sexuality frequently. The author tried to hint they didn't want that and later told them their beliefs, leading to being called homophobic. They don't have an issue with being gay but want to avoid the topic.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author isn't opposed to being gay but finds the constant references annoying. They tried to communicate this subtly and then more directly. The key here is whether it's reasonable to expect people to not mention their identity, especially if it's a significant part of their personal experience.\n\nIn many discussions about personal identity, especially in the LGBTQ+ community, openness about one's sexuality is often a way to affirm one's identity and seek acceptance. If someone is part of a group that has historically faced discrimination, they might feel the need to be more vocal about their identity. The author's discomfort here could stem from a lack of understanding of how identity expression is a personal and often necessary aspect for many people.\n\nThe author's request to \"keep me out of it\" might not take into account that the people they met might be in an environment where they feel safe to express their identity, or they might be sharing it as part of building trust. The author's frustration seems to be about frequency rather than acceptance, but the way they approach it could come off as dismissive or invalidating. Even if the author says they accept the people, the pushback from the others is understandable because the author's actions (mentioning beliefs and hinting) might not have been respectful of the others' need to express their identity.\n\nAlso, the author might not be considering that their reaction could be seen as contributing to the stigma, even if unintentionally. The concept of \"allyship\" often involves respecting others' need to express their identity without judgment, even if it's not the ally's place to engage with it. So, the author's desire to avoid the topic and their reaction to the constant mentions might be seen as not being a supportive ally, even if they aren't actively opposing LGBTQ+ rights.\n\nIn terms of whether they're in the wrong, it's about perspective. The author isn't acting with malice but their actions could be hurtful. The people they met might feel that their identity is being downplayed or that the author is uncomfortable with their openness, which is a valid feeling. The author's approach to communicating their discomfort might not have been respectful enough, leading to the resentment mentioned. So, the answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong because their actions, while not malicious, are dismissive of the other people's need to express their identity and could be seen as contributing to an unwelcoming environment.\n"
