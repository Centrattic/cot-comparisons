However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves someone who met two gay individuals and found their constant mention of their sexuality annoying. The person in question says they don't have an issue with gay people but get uncomfortable when their sexuality is brought up frequently. They tried subtly hinting at this and then directly expressed their feelings, leading to being labeled as homophobic.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key elements here. The author claims they don't have a problem with being gay but feel that their sexual orientation is mentioned too often, causing discomfort. They want others to keep their personal lives private unless they want to share. However, the friends reacted negatively, calling them unaccepting despite the author's clear stance that they accept them.\n\nNow, the ethical angle here involves balancing personal boundaries with respect for others' identities. The author isn't opposing the other's sexuality but is frustrated with how frequently it's brought up. However, the friends might feel that their identity is being invalidated or ignored when the author asks them to stop mentioning it. The author's request could be seen as dismissing their authentic expression of self. \n\nSocietally, there's an emphasis on being inclusive and allowing people to express their identities freely. If someone feels that their identity is being downplayed or erased to make others more comfortable, that's a problem. The author might be in the wrong because they're asking the friends to conceal a part of their identity to accommodate their discomfort. Even if the friends were being overly vocal, the author's approach might have been insensitive. It's possible that the friends felt their identity was being attacked, hence the negative reaction.\n\nAnother angle is the difference between personal discomfort and respecting others' needs. The author's discomfort doesn't give them the right to demand that others hide aspects of themselves. The friends might need to express their sexuality as part of their identity, and the author's request could be seen as a form of microaggression or exclusion. The answer likely hinges on whether the author's actions were respectful of the friends' needs versus their own discomfort. Since the author isn't opposing the sexuality itself but is bothered by the frequency of mentions, the issue is about how they handled it, potentially disregarding the friends' need to share their identity. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
