However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not caring about gay pride and becoming uncomfortable when two gay friends kept mentioning their sexuality. The author tried to hint and then directly tell them to stop, leading to being called homophobic.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author says they have no issue with gay people and accept them but just don't want them to mention their sexuality so often. The key points here are the author's intentions and the reactions of the friends. The friends felt called out and labeled the author as homophobic despite the author stating acceptance.\n\nI should think about the social norms around discussing personal identity. People often mention their identity when it's relevant, especially if it's part of their experience. However, the author is bothered by the frequency. But is it the author's place to demand others stop discussing their sexuality? The friends might feel that the author's request is dismissive of their identity. \n\nAlso, even if the author says they accept them, the act of telling someone to stop expressing their identity can come off as invalidating. The friends might perceive this as not truly accepting them. The author's frustration is understandable, but the way they addressed it might not have been appropriate. \n\nAnother angle is that the author's discomfort leads them to ask others to hide a significant part of themselves. This could be seen as the author's intolerance, not the friends. The friends are expressing themselves, which is their right, and the author's issue is with how they do it, not the fact that they're gay.\n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because they are imposing their discomfort onto others regarding their identity expression. The friends' reactions as homophobic might be harsh, but the author's approach was flawed. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
