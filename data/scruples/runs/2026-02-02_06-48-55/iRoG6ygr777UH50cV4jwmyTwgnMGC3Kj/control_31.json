However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them. (Even though I /clearly/ said I do accept them for their sexuality. I would just appreciate it if they didn't annoyingly mention it ever few minutes! Am I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is at fault for not caring about gay pride and being uncomfortable with others who are openly gay.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that they don't have an issue with gay people but feel that the individuals they met were being too vocal about their sexuality. They found it uncomfortable when these friends kept mentioning being gay in every conversation. The author tried to hint that this was too much and then directly stated their views, which led to being called homophobic despite emphasizing they accept the people's sexuality.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author isn't opposed to homosexuality, but they're annoyed by the frequent mentions of it. They want others to keep their sexuality private unless it's necessary. The friends reacted negatively, labeling the author as unaccepting. The question is whether the author is wrong for feeling that way.\n\nI need to consider if the author's request is reasonable. Everyone has the right to be themselves and express their identity. If someone is being openly gay, that's their choice. The author's discomfort is about the frequency of the mentions, not the sexuality itself. However, the friends might feel that their identity is important to them and that the author's discomfort led to invalidation. \n\nIn terms of social norms, it's generally expected to respect others' identities, but it's also okay to set boundaries in conversations. However, the author's issue isn't with their friends' sexuality but with how often they mention it. The problem arises when the author communicates their discomfort in a way that's perceived as rejection of the friends' identity, even if they don't mean to. \n\nThe friends were called homophobic because the author's actions made them feel as though their identity wasn't accepted. Even if the author didn't intend it, the impact of their words might have been hurtful. The author might be in the wrong if their actions, despite their intent, made the friends feel unwelcome. But if they clearly stated they accept them and only wanted less frequent mentions, maybe there's a misunderstanding.\n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, the author isn't discriminating against the friends' sexuality. On the other, the friends felt their identity was under attack. The answer might depend on whether the author's request is reasonable and respectful. If the author's way of expressing their discomfort was dismissive, then they might be in the wrong. If they communicated it respectfully, maybe not. But the friends might feel that their identity is a core part of who they are and shouldn't be downplayed. \n\nSo considering all that, the author's discomfort might not make them in the wrong, but their approach could be problematic. However, the friends have the right to express their identity. The author isn't wrong for having personal preferences, but they might not have handled the situation well, leading to the friends' negative reaction. But the core issue is whether the author is wrong for not wanting to engage with the topic. The answer could lean towards A (in the wrong) because they might not be respecting their friends' need to express their identity, but maybe B (not in the wrong) if they aren't opposing the sexuality itself. Hmm.\n"
