However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the writer meeting two gay individuals who frequently mention their sexuality, making the writer uncomfortable. The writer tries to subtly hint about it and later states their beliefs, leading to being called homophobic even though they said they accept them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The writer doesn't have an issue with being gay but feels that the two people are too explicit about their sexuality in conversation. They tried to hint that it's too much, then stated their views, which led to conflict. The question is whether the writer is in the wrong.\n\nFrom a social justice perspective, it's important to recognize that people should be free to express their identity without feeling forced to hide it. If the two individuals are openly discussing their sexuality, which they have every right to do, the writer's discomfort might stem from personal preferences rather than any actual homophobia. However, the writer claims they don't have a problem with gay people, so the issue isn't with their identity but with how frequently it's mentioned.\n\nThe writer says they accept them but want them to stop bringing it up. The problem here is that the people they met might feel their authentic self-expression is being policed. It's possible that the writer's discomfort could be seen as invalidating the other's need to express their identity. Even if the writer isn't openly hostile, the request to stop mentioning their sexuality could be perceived as wanting to erase or downplay a fundamental part of their identity.\n\nAlso, when the writer tried to communicate this, they were met with accusations of being homophobic. This might be because the other people interpreted the writer's comments as not accepting their identity, even if the writer didn't mean it that way. The line between personal boundaries and respecting someone's identity can be blurry here.\n\nIn terms of social norms, people generally have the right to discuss their identity as they see fit, provided it's not at the expense of others. However, the writer is also within their right to set boundaries if they find certain topics uncomfortable. The conflict arises when these boundaries are communicated in a way that others perceive as rejection of their identity.\n\nThe key here is whether the writer's actions are inconsiderate. If the two individuals are making their sexuality a regular part of conversation, and the writer finds it annoying, but the writer isn't discriminating against them, then the writer might not be in the wrong. However, if the writer's discomfort is based on the assumption that their sexuality should be irrelevant, that could be problematic.\n\nAnother angle is intent vs. impact. The writer's intent was to reduce the frequency of mentions, but the impact could be interpreted as wanting to suppress their identity. Even if unintended, the impact might be seen as harmful, leading others to feel that the writer is not truly accepting.\n\nIn conclusion, the writer's main issue is the frequency of mentions, not the fact that they're gay. However, the way they communicated their discomfort might have been misinterpreted. It's a complex situation where both parties might have valid points, but the writer's actions could be seen as inconsiderate of the other person's right to express their identity openly.\n"
