However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them. (Even though I /clearly/ said I do accept them for their sexuality. I would just appreciate it if they didn't annoyingly mention it ever few minutes! Am I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the given situation. The author is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for not caring about gay pride and being annoyed when two gay people kept mentioning their sexuality. The key points here are the author's discomfort with the frequency of the mentions, their attempts to subtly hint at it, and then being called homophobic even after stating they accept them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author doesn't have a problem with being gay but finds the constant references annoying. They tried to hint and then directly stated their views. The friends reacted negatively, calling them homophobic. The author is confused because they didn't say they had an issue with gay people.\n\nNow, thinking about societal norms and what's considered acceptable. People often express their identity proudly, especially in environments where it's important to them. If someone is part of a marginalized group, they might emphasize their identity as a way to assert themselves or seek solidarity. However, the author is uncomfortable with the frequency. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. In many cases, people should be allowed to express their identity as they see fit. Expecting others to not mention their sexuality could be seen as trying to erase their identity. Even if the author isn't supportive of pride events, their dislike of the frequent mentions could be viewed as wanting others to downplay their identity, which might be seen as dismissive.\n\nAlso, when the author tried to express their discomfort and was labeled as homophobic, that's a common response when someone's actions are seen as not supportive of LGBTQ+ individuals. The author might have unintentionally communicated that they don't support their identity, even if they say they accept them. Acceptance doesn't mean being okay with every expression of that identity, but if it's a core part of who someone is, they might expect it to come up.\n\nOn the other hand, the friends overreacting by labeling the author as homophobic without considering the author's statements could be an issue. But the core issue is whether the author's request for the friends to not mention their sexuality so much is reasonable.\n\nIn terms of social norms, it's generally considered okay for people to talk about their identity, and others should respect that unless it's harmful. The author might be in the wrong for expressing discomfort about something that's a fundamental part of the friends' identity. So, the answer would likely be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
