However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them.

      "text": "Okay, let's look at this situation. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author met two gay people but started to dislike them because they made their sexuality too obvious in conversation. The author says they don't have a problem with being gay but don't support it. They tried to hint that it was annoying and then stated their beliefs, which led to being called homophobic.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author's main issue is the frequency with which the two individuals mentioned their sexuality. The author claims to accept them but finds it uncomfortable when they bring it up every few minutes. They tried to address it subtly and then directly, leading to conflict.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a social perspective, making someone uncomfortable about their identity might not be the right approach. If the author is okay with their sexuality but finds the constant references to it annoying, that's a personal preference. However, it's important to recognize that for some people, especially in spaces where they can be open about their identity, discussing it might be a form of self-expression or a way to connect. The author's response, even if they state acceptance, could come across as dismissive or judgmental because they're asking the other person to downplay a part of their identity.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that after stating their beliefs, they were called homophobic. Even if they didn't mean it that way, the act of objecting to the discussion of someone's sexuality, despite accepting them, can be seen as contributing to a hostile environment. The key here is that the author is not opposing the existence of gay people but their expression of it. That can create a paradox where they are both accepting and rejecting an aspect of the person's identity.\n\nIn terms of social norms, it's generally expected to respect others' identities and how they choose to express them. While the author isn't opposing the people's sexuality, their discomfort with the frequency of discussion might not be a valid reason to ask others to alter their behavior. The author's approach might be seen as trying to impose their comfort level on others, which isn't fair. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong because they are contributing to an environment where people might feel they need to hide or downplay their identity to make someone else comfortable. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
