However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them. (Even though I /clearly/ said I do accept them for their sexuality. I would just appreciate it if they didn't annoyingly mention it ever few minutes! Am I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that they met two gay people who kept mentioning their sexuality a lot, making the author uncomfortable. The author tried to hint they didn't want it mentioned so much, then got called homophobic when they stated their beliefs. The options are A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong).\n\nFirst, the key points here are about respecting personal boundaries and the context of being in a relationship. The author says they have no issue with gay people but find the constant mention of their sexuality annoying. However, the other people were openly expressing their identity, which is their right. The author's discomfort stems from the frequency, not the content. \n\nBut here's the catch: if someone is in a relationship with another person, it's reasonable for that person to share aspects of their identity, including their sexuality. The author's frustration might come from a place of wanting the relationship to focus on other things, but the other people could see sharing their identity as natural and important for them. \n\nThe author tried to hint and then directly communicated their feelings. However, when the other people reacted negatively, the author was accused of being homophobic. The problem here is that the author's stance seems to be about not wanting to be involved in the other person's identity, which could be seen as invalidating. Even if the author says they accept, the act of asking them to hide their identity might conflict with that. \n\nIn terms of social norms and equality, individuals are entitled to express their identity without being forced to conceal it. The author's request for them to avoid mentioning it could be seen as a form of exclusion, even if not intentional. The other people might feel that the author is not fully accepting, hence the backlash. \n\nSo, while the author isn't bigoted, their approach might have been inconsiderate of the other people's need to express their identity. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong because they're imposing their discomfort onto others who are within their right to express themselves.\n"
