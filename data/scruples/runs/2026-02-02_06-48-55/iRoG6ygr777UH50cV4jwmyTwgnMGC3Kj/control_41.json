However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not caring about gay pride and becoming uncomfortable with two gay friends who frequently mention their sexuality. The author tried to subtly hint they didn't want the constant references and then expressed their beliefs, leading to being called homophobic. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A or B).\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author states they don't have an issue with gay people but don't support them and just want them to keep their sexuality private. The friends, however, were open about their identity, which the author found annoying. The author tried to hint at it but then directly expressed their discomfort, leading to conflict.\n\nFrom a social perspective, being open about one's identity is a personal choice. LGBTQ+ individuals often face discrimination and may feel the need to assert their identity to combat stigma. The author's discomfort with the friends constantly mentioning their sexuality might be about personal preference, but the friends have every right to be open about who they are. The author's request to not mention their sexuality could be seen as wanting them to hide their identity, which is a form of exclusion. Even if the author says they accept the friends, the underlying message might be that their sexuality is something to be downplayed, which is not supportive.\n\nAdditionally, the friends might have felt that the author was being judgmental or dismissive, even if the author didn't intend to be. The term \"homophobic\" is strong, but if the friends felt that the author was rejecting their identity by wanting them to stop mentioning it, they might see it that way. The author's position is that they are neutral, but in reality, not supporting or acknowledging someone's identity can be seen as complicit in marginalizing them.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might genuinely feel that the friends were overdoing it. However, the friends had the right to be open about their sexuality. The author's reaction could be seen as invalidating their identity. So, while the author might not have malicious intent, their actions still caused distress and could be considered inconsiderate or dismissive of the friends' needs.\n\nTherefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because they are asking the friends to hide a part of their identity, which is not acceptable, even if they don't have an issue with being gay themselves.\n"
