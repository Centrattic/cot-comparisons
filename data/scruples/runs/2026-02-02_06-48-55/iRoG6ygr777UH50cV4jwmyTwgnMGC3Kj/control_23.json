However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them. (Even though I /clearly/ said I do accept them for their sexuality. I would just appreciate it if they didn't annoyingly mention it ever few minutes! Am I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not caring about gay pride and being annoyed by their friends' frequent mentions of being gay.\n\nFirst, the author says they don't have an issue with gay people but are uncomfortable with the constant emphasis on their sexuality. They tried to hint and then directly state their concerns but were labeled as homophobic. The key here is whether the author's actions were acceptable or not.\n\nThe author's friends might feel that their identity is important to them, and if they choose to share it, others should be okay with it. But the author is asserting their own comfort boundaries. It's a common issue in social interactions where personal boundaries clash with others' self-expression.\n\nHowever, the problem arises when the author's discomfort leads to making others feel unwelcome or resented. Even if the author doesn't have malice, the act of criticizing someone for expressing their identity can be seen as invalidating. The friends might perceive the author's comments as judgmental, even if the author claims acceptance. The line between setting boundaries and being intolerant can be thin here.\n\nAlso, the author's friends might feel that their identity is a significant part of who they are, and they have a right to express it without fear of criticism. The author's frustration might stem from a lack of understanding of the friends' need to assert their identity, perhaps due to past experiences of discrimination or the importance of visibility in their community.\n\nIn terms of social norms, it's generally expected to respect others' identities without making them feel they have to hide or downplay it. The author might be in the wrong because they're asking the friends to suppress a core part of their identity for the author's comfort. However, the author's intention wasn't to be hostile, just to avoid the topic. But the friends' reaction suggests that the author's words were hurtful, even if unintended.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's actions, while possibly well-meaning, crossed into invalidating the friends' self-expression. They might be in the wrong because they're contributing to a hostile environment by not respecting the friends' need to express their identity, even if it's uncomfortable for them personally.\n"
