However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong. The situation is that the author met two gay people, but became uncomfortable because they mentioned their sexuality frequently. The author tried to subtly hint that they didn't want the constant mentions and then directly expressed their feelings, leading to being called homophobic.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and social aspects. In many places, being homophobic or discriminatory is not just socially frowned upon but can also have legal consequences. However, this situation is more about personal discomfort rather than discrimination. The author states they don't have an issue with gay people but are annoyed by the constant mentions. \n\nNext, the author's actions: they tried to hint and then directly told the individuals they found the frequent references uncomfortable. The key question is whether the individuals are within their rights to mention their identity. People have the right to discuss their own sexuality, and it's a part of their identity. The author might be infringing on that right by asking them not to mention it, unless there's a specific context where such discussions are inappropriate (like in a professional setting). However, since the context isn't specified, it's likely a social situation where individuals can express their identity freely.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of \"allyship.\" Allies are supposed to support LGBTQ+ individuals, but the author is saying they don't want to be involved. However, the individuals are not imposing their sexuality on others in a harmful way\u2014just discussing it as part of their identity. The author's discomfort might be based on personal preference rather than the other's actions being offensive.\n\nThe author claims they don't have a problem with being gay but are annoyed by the constant mentions. The line between personal boundaries and respect for someone else's identity is thin here. However, it's important to recognize that for some people, discussing their identity is a natural part of their self-expression, especially if they feel accepted. The author's request could be seen as dismissing the importance of that expression.\n\nAlso, when the author directly expressed their feelings, they were met with negative reactions. The other people felt disrespected or seen as homophobic, which the author denies. The author might not realize that their request could come off as invalidating the other's need to express their identity. Even if the author's intention wasn't to be discriminatory, the impact on the other individuals was negative.\n\nIn terms of social norms, it's generally expected to respect others' identities and allow them to express themselves without interference, unless it's harmful. The author's issue isn't with the people's sexuality but with how they express it. However, the frequency of mentioning one's identity isn't inherently harmful, and others might find it important for their self-affirmation. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the author might be in the wrong because they are imposing their personal discomfort on others, potentially violating their right to express their identity. The key is that while the author has the right to their feelings, they shouldn't force others to suppress their identity to accommodate those feelings. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
