However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them. (Even though I /clearly/ said I do accept them for their sexuality. I would just appreciate it if they didn't annoyingly mention it ever few minutes! Am I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author met two gay people and started to dislike them because they kept mentioning their sexuality. The author tried to hint and then directly tell them to stop, but was called homophobic even though they said they accept them. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms around LGBTQ+ issues. People being open about their sexuality is part of self-expression. The author is uncomfortable with how often their sexuality is mentioned but isn't opposed to being gay. However, the act of calling someone out for being too open about it could be seen as dismissive of their right to express their identity. \n\nThe author's approach: first subtly hinting, then directly stating their discomfort. But even if they accept the people's sexuality, expressing discomfort about them mentioning it might still come across as judgmental. The response from the others was resentment and being called homophobic, which the author argues isn't fair because they said they accept them. But maybe the author's reaction, despite intentions, was still harmful or invalidating.\n\nAlso, the author's attitude of \"keep me out of it\" might imply that the others' presence or discussion of their identity is a burden. That's a problematic stance because it's the others' right to be open about who they are. The author's frustration stems from annoyance, not hate, but the impact is still negative. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author's actions, while not driven by malice, still caused harm. They didn't respect the other people's autonomy to express their identity as they see fit. The key point is that while the author isn't against being gay, their reaction to the expression of that identity is where they went wrong. So the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
