When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma\u2019s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn\u2019t want to see me anymore. \n\nI was upset but I gave him space thinking I\u2019d talk to him and explain he doesn\u2019t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it\u2019s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don\u2019t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn\u2019t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn\u2019t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to forgive their younger brother. The situation involves a past argument between the author and their mom about Grandma's fortune, and the brother cutting off contact at age 12. The author tried to reach out but didn't get a response, and now after three years, the brother wants to talk, but the author says no, emphasizing the age when he acted and the lasting consequences.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The brother was 12 when he cut off contact, which is a young age. The author is 20 now, so three years have passed. The brother's stepdad confirmed the mom had no part in the decision, so it was the brother's choice. The author feels the brother should have taken responsibility earlier and that the actions had real consequences. The mom also distanced the author from the family.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the brother's actions were hurtful and cutting off contact without explanation is tough. But he was a child at the time, maybe acting on emotions or pressure, even if he made the decision. The author's stance is about accountability and the lasting impact. \n\nHowever, forgiveness is a personal choice. The author might feel that the brother didn't show remorse for three years, so refusing to forgive isn't necessarily wrong. But does the brother's age at the time of the action affect the author's right to hold a grudge? At 12, a child might not fully understand the long-term consequences of cutting off a sibling. The author might be holding past actions against him, which could be seen as harsh if the brother is now seeking to make amends.\n\nAlso, the brother's stepdad confirming that the mom wasn't involved suggests the brother's decision was his own, but does that justify three years of silence? The author might feel that the brother could have reached out sooner. However, the brother's stepdad might not be the best source for the brother's intentions. The author's position is that the brother had a chance and didn't take it. \n\nOn the other side, the author's mom excluded them from the family tree, which is a significant consequence. The author might be feeling resentment and not wanting to forgive because they see the brother as having taken sides. The author might be using the brother's age as a reason to not let it go, but maybe they should consider that the brother was a child with limited emotional maturity.\n\nIs the author being too strict? Or is holding a grudge for three years after a betrayal acceptable? The question is about whether the author is in the wrong for not forgiving. The user's opinion is that the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate this.\n\nThe brother's actions were cutting off all communication, which can be seen as a rejection. The author might feel abandoned or that their relationship wasn't valued. The brother is now seeking to reconnect, but the author is firm. The author's reasoning is that the brother had a chance to reconcile earlier. However, the brother was 12 and perhaps acted impulsively. \n\nForgiveness is part of healing, but it's also personal. If the author isn't ready, they have the right to not forgive. But does that make them in the wrong? Maybe not, because the brother's actions were severe. However, the brother is now trying to apologize, which could be a genuine effort. The author might be denying the brother a chance to explain or change. \n\nThe key here is that the brother's actions were his own, and the author is holding him accountable. But the brother was a child, so maybe the author is overreacting by not allowing any redemption. The author's stance is about consequences, but maybe the brother did face consequences by losing a sibling relationship. \n\nI think the answer depends on the perspective. The author might not be in the wrong because they're protecting their boundaries and holding the brother accountable for his actions. However, some might argue that the brother was just a kid and deserves a chance to explain. But given the author's reasoning about real consequences and the brother's lack of communication, the author's position could be justified. So the answer is B.\n"
