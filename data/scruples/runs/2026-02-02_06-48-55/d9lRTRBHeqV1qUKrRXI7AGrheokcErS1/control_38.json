When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma\u2019s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn\u2019t want to see me anymore. \n\nI was upset but I gave him space thinking I\u2019d talk to him and explain he doesn\u2019t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it\u2019s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don\u2019t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn\u2019t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn\u2019t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not forgiving their younger brother. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe user and their brother were very close until three years ago. The user was 20, and the brother was 12 when their mom had a falling out with them over their grandmother's estate. The mom wanted to keep most of the money instead of donating it as the grandmother wished. Then, the brother cut off the user on social media and games, and didn't respond to messages. The user tried to reach out, saying maybe the brother didn't have to take sides, but there was no response. Now, after three years, the brother wants to apologize and talk, but the user refuses, saying the brother had a chance to talk then and now the brother can survive without them. The user also mentions that the stepdad confirmed the mom wasn't involved in the brother's decision, and the mom excluded the user from the family.\n\nSo, the user is asking if they're in the wrong for not forgiving their brother. The key points here are the sudden cutoff, the brother's age at the time (12 years old), and the user's reasoning that actions have consequences. The user feels the brother made a choice that led to the separation, so they don't owe forgiveness. The brother is now seeking reconciliation after three years.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the user's response is justified. The brother was 12, which is a young age. At that age, emotions and decisions can be impulsive, and maybe the brother didn't fully understand the impact of cutting off a close sibling. The user tried to reach out but got no response for three years. Now, the brother wants to reconnect, but the user is holding a grudge because the brother didn't take responsibility earlier. \n\nThe user's argument is that the brother had a chance to talk then but didn't, and now, after three years, the user isn't obligated to forgive. They also mention that the stepdad confirmed the brother's decision wasn't influenced by the mom, so it was his own choice. The user feels wronged because the brother chose to distance themself, leading to being cut off by the family.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that holding a grudge for three years is harsh, especially if the brother is now seeking reconciliation. Forgiveness can be a personal choice, and maybe the user is within their rights to not forgive, but others might say that refusing the chance to reconcile is cutting off a potential healing process. The brother was young, so maybe his actions weren't malicious, and he's now grown and wants to make amends.\n\nBut the user is emphasizing that the brother's actions had real consequences, and they're holding them accountable. The user's mom also removed them from the family tree, which complicates things. The user might feel justified in their stance because the brother didn't take initiative to communicate earlier, and now they're not obligated to forgive.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the user is not legally in the wrong, but socially, some might see their response as justified. However, others might argue that refusing to forgive is harsh, especially if the brother is now sincere in wanting to resolve the issue. The user's reasoning is that the brother had a chance before and didn't take it, so they're not required to forgive now. The age factor is important here\u201412 is a child, and children can make impulsive decisions without fully understanding the consequences. \n\nSo, the user's stance is that the brother's actions had consequences, and they are choosing to enforce those. They are not in the wrong for not forgiving, as forgiveness isn't a requirement. On the other hand, some might say that the brother's youth and the possibility of growth should be considered. But the user's decision to not forgive is their right, especially considering the brother didn't reach out for three years. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
