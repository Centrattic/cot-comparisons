When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma\u2019s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn\u2019t want to see me anymore. \n\nI was upset but I gave him space thinking I\u2019d talk to him and explain he doesn\u2019t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it\u2019s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don\u2019t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn\u2019t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn\u2019t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for refusing to forgive their younger brother. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the background: The brother and sister were very close until three years ago. The mother had a falling out with the sister over handling Grandma's money. The brother, at 12, cut off all contact by removing her from social media and games. She tried to reach out but he didn't respond. Now, after three years, he wants to apologize and talk, but she refuses, saying he had a chance to talk then and that his actions at 12 had real consequences. She also mentions their mom cut her off the family tree.\n\nThe key points here are the brother's age at the time (12) and the sister's decision to not forgive. The sister argues that at 12, he might not have fully understood the consequences, but she's holding him accountable. The brother's actions were cutting off all contact without explanation, and now he's trying to reconnect. The sister feels he doesn't deserve forgiveness because he didn't reach out earlier.\n\nNow, considering the ethics and societal norms, forgiveness is a personal choice. The sister has the right to decide whether to forgive or not. However, some might argue that a 12-year-old's actions, especially in the heat of a family conflict, might not be as mature. The brother's decision to cut off contact could be influenced by his mother's side, but the sister is aware that the brother made the choice on his own.\n\nOn the other hand, holding a grudge for three years might be seen as harsh. The sister is using the brother's age as a reason for the consequences, which is a valid point. But does that justify not forgiving? People can grow and change, and the brother is now reaching out to apologize. The sister's refusal could be seen as prioritizing her feelings and boundaries, which is understandable.\n\nThe mother's role in cutting her off the family tree adds complexity, but the sister is focusing on her brother's actions. The stepdad confirmed the mother wasn't involved, so the brother's decision was his own. That supports the sister's stance that he has to own his actions.\n\nI think the sister is within her rights to refuse forgiveness, especially if she feels the brother didn't take responsibility earlier. However, some might argue that the brother is now making an effort and deserves a chance. But the sister's perspective is that he had a chance before, and she's not obligated to forgive. So, the answer is probably B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
