When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma\u2019s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn\u2019t want to see me anymore. \n\nI was upset but I gave him space thinking I\u2019d talk to him and explain he doesn\u2019t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it\u2019s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don\u2019t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn\u2019t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn\u2019t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for refusing to forgive their younger brother. The situation involves a family conflict over a disagreement about handling Grandma's fortune, which led to the brother cutting off contact. The author is now being questioned if they're in the wrong for not wanting to reconcile after three years.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The brother was 12 when he cut ties, which is a pretty young age. The author, being 20 at the time, had a falling out with their mom over the donation of Grandma's fortune. The brother took offense and blocked them. The author tried to reach out but got ignored. Now, three years later, the brother wants to apologize, but the author refuses, citing that at 12, the brother should have understood the consequences of his actions.\n\nThe user thinks the author might be wrong, but I need to form my own opinion. The key points here are the age of the brother at the time, the reason for the falling out, and the author's response now. \n\nAt 12, a child is still developing emotional maturity. The brother's reaction might have been an impulsive or emotionally driven decision, possibly influenced by family dynamics or not fully understanding the adult situation. The author is holding them accountable for actions taken at a young age, which could be seen as harsh. However, the author is also standing by their decision to not grant forgiveness, which could be seen as justified if they feel the brother should have taken responsibility earlier.\n\nOn the other hand, holding a grudge for three years might not be healthy. The brother is trying to reconcile, which shows maturity and a willingness to make amends. The author's response could be seen as cutting off a chance for healing, especially since the brother was a minor at the time. Also, the mother cutting the author off from the family tree adds another layer of complexity, possibly making the author feel betrayed or abandoned, which might explain their stance.\n\nBut considering the brother's age and potential immaturity at the time, the author's refusal might be too rigid. Forgiveness doesn't owe itself to anyone, but the situation's context (childhood behavior) might mean the author is being overly strict. The author might be in the right to set boundaries, but is refusing forgiveness entirely the right approach? It's a balance between accountability and understanding the limitations of a young person's actions.\n\nAnother angle: the brother's decision was his own, confirmed by the stepdad, so the author can't blame the mom. But at 12, the brother might not have grasped the full implications of cutting ties. The author's message about consequences is valid, but maybe the brother now recognizes his mistake. The author's refusal could be seen as holding onto past hurt without allowing growth.\n\nIn summary, the author's stance has elements of holding someone accountable for past actions, which is reasonable, but considering the brother's age, the author might be too rigid. However, forgiveness isn't always required, so the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. But the question is whether they are in the wrong. The answer depends on whether the refusal is justified given the context. The author might be justified in not being obligated to forgive, but the refusal could be seen as harsh. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the author has a right to set boundaries, especially since the brother's actions were at a young age. However, the author could have considered the brother's growth and willingness to apologize. It's a nuanced situation, but the answer likely hinges on the brother's age and the author's right to set their own terms.\n"
