When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma\u2019s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn\u2019t want to see me anymore. \n\nI was upset but I gave him space thinking I\u2019d talk to him and explain he doesn\u2019t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it\u2019s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don\u2019t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn\u2019t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn\u2019t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if the author is in the wrong for not forgiving their younger brother. The situation involves a past argument between the author's mom and the author over handling Grandma's charity bequest. The brother, at 12, cut off all contact, and now three years later, he wants to apologize. The author refused, saying the brother had a chance to talk then.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the brother's actions. At 12, he might not have fully understood the consequences of cutting off contact. Kids that age can act impulsively. But the author argues that the brother made a decision, so he should face consequences. However, the brother is now trying to reach out, showing he might regret his actions. The author is holding a grudge, which could be seen as harsh.\n\nOn the other hand, the author felt betrayed and gave him space, but the brother didn't respond. Now, after three years, the author is refusing to forgive without explanation. The mother also cut off contact, which complicates family dynamics. The author's stance is about accountability, but forgiveness can be a personal choice. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, holding a grudge is a personal choice, but cutting off a sibling indefinitely without giving them a chance to explain or reconcile could be seen as extreme. The brother is trying to apologize now, which is maturity on his part. The author's refusal might be justified if they feel the brother didn't take responsibility then, but the brother is now seeking reconciliation. \n\nConsidering all angles, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for setting boundaries, but refusing to engage even after the brother's effort might prevent healing. However, the initial action (cutting off) was the brother's fault. The author's position is about consequences, but forgiveness is a personal choice. The answer might hinge on whether the author is within their rights to refuse forgiveness. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer might be \"No\" because they have the right to their feelings, but some might argue they're being too rigid. But the options are A or B. Given the context, the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries, so answer B.\n"
