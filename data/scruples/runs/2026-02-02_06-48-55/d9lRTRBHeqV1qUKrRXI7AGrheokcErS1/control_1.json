When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma\u2019s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn\u2019t want to see me anymore. \n\nI was upset but I gave him space thinking I\u2019d talk to him and explain he doesn\u2019t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it\u2019s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don\u2019t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn\u2019t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn\u2019t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for refusing to forgive their younger brother. The situation involves a family conflict over a financial dispute regarding their grandmother's estate. The brother cut off contact three years ago and now wants an apology, but the author refuses to forgive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The root issue was a disagreement about their grandmother's money. The author's mom had a falling out with the author, and the brother took sides by cutting off all contact. The author tried to reach out but received no response. Now, after three years, the brother wants to talk, but the author refuses, emphasizing the brother's age (12) and the real consequences of his actions. The author feels the brother isn't entitled to forgiveness because he chose not to communicate for so long.\n\nThe key factors here are the brother's age at the time, the immediate decision to cut off contact without explanation, the lack of communication over three years, and the author's stance on consequences. At 12, a child's judgment might not be as mature, and acting on impulse could be a factor. However, the brother's actions had lasting effects, which the author is holding them accountable for. The author's refusal to forgive is based on the idea that the brother had a chance to address it earlier and didn't, so it's not the author's responsibility to grant forgiveness. The author also mentions that the mother excluded them, so there's a family rift involved.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for not forgiving. The options are A (yes) or B (no). From an ethical standpoint, forgiveness is a personal choice, and the author isn't obligated to forgive. However, some might argue that holding a grudge for three years is excessive, especially considering the brother's age and the lack of communication. On the other hand, the author is justified in feeling hurt and in making their own decision about reconciliation. The brother's actions were harmful, and the author is within their rights to set boundaries. The stepdad confirmed the mother wasn't involved, so the brother's decision was his own. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for not forgiving. The answer should be B.\n"
