When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma\u2019s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn\u2019t want to see me anymore. \n\nI was upset but I gave him space thinking I\u2019d talk to him and explain he doesn\u2019t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it\u2019s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don\u2019t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn\u2019t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn\u2019t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a brother cutting off the author over a disagreement with their mom and then trying to reconnect after three years. The author refused to forgive him. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The brother was 12 when he cut off the older sibling. The author gives context about a family conflict involving their grandmother's inheritance. The younger brother took it upon himself to cut off the older sibling, possibly as a reaction to the mom's actions. Now, after three years, the brother wants to apologize and talk, but the author refuses.\n\nThe author argues that at 12, the brother should understand the consequences of his actions. The stepdad confirmed the mom wasn't involved, so it was the brother's own decision. The author feels the brother isn't entitled to forgiveness because he had a chance to reconcile earlier.\n\nI need to consider if the author's refusal is wrong. On one hand, the brother was a child (12 years old) and might not have acted with full maturity. Cutting off a sibling could be a childish reaction. But the author is now refusing to reconnect, which might seem harsh. However, the author is holding the brother accountable for his choice, which could be justified if the brother's actions were intentional and hurtful.\n\nBut wait, the brother is trying to apologize now. The author is denying that chance. Should forgiveness be automatic, or is it up to the author? Forgiveness can be a personal choice. The brother's actions were three years ago; maybe he's grown since then. The author's stance is that he should have acted then, but people can change. \n\nHowever, the brother was 12, so maybe his actions were not fully intentional. At that age, kids might not grasp the long-term impact. The author might be right to not forgive if they feel the brother didn't learn from his actions. But is it fair to hold a child's mistake against them into adulthood? \n\nAlso, the mother cut them off from the family tree, which adds to the complexity. The author might be dealing with lingering anger towards the family. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often look for whether the person's actions are proportionate. The author is choosing not to forgive, which is their right, but is it wrong? If the brother is genuinely sorry and wants to make amends, is the author being unreasonable by refusing? Or is the author justified in holding the brother accountable for his past decision?\n\nI think the answer depends on perspective. The author isn't in the wrong because forgiveness isn't required, especially when the other party had a chance to address it earlier. However, some might argue that the brother was just a child and the author is overreacting. But given the context that the mother was excluded from the conflict, the brother's actions were his own, and the author's stance is about accountability, the author's position might be valid. So, the answer could be B (not in the wrong).\n"
