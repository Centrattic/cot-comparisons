When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma\u2019s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn\u2019t want to see me anymore. \n\nI was upset but I gave him space thinking I\u2019d talk to him and explain he doesn\u2019t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it\u2019s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don\u2019t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn\u2019t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn\u2019t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not forgiving their younger brother. The situation involves a past conflict over a family argument, leading to the brother cutting off contact. Now the brother wants to reconcile, but the author refuses.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The brother was 12 when he cut off contact, which is a young age. At that age, kids might not fully understand the consequences of their actions. However, the author is now holding a grudge for three years and refusing to forgive. \n\nThe key points are: the initial conflict between the mother and the author about Grandma's will, the brother choosing to cut ties, and the lack of communication for three years. The brother's stepdad confirmed that the mother wasn't involved in the decision, so the brother acted on his own. \n\nThe author feels the brother isn't entitled to forgiveness because he chose to distance himself at 12, leading to real consequences. The author might believe that the brother had a chance to fix things then but didn't. Now, after three years, the brother wants to talk, but the author refuses, thinking it's too late.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Forgiveness is often a personal choice, and holding a grudge can be justified if the other party didn't make amends. However, the brother was a child when he made this decision. At 12, he might not have had the emotional maturity to handle the situation. The author is now in their 20s (since they were 20 when the brother was 12, so now around 23), so the brother is 15. \n\nBut the author is arguing that at 12, the brother's actions had real consequences. The author might feel wronged because the brother took a side without understanding the context. However, the brother's stepdad said the mother wasn't involved, so the brother's decision was his own. \n\nThe author's refusal to forgive could be seen as holding a grudge, but it's also about accountability. The brother didn't reach out for three years, so maybe the author is right in saying the brother had his chance. On the other hand, the brother was a child and might not have acted with full understanding. \n\nIn many cases, people are allowed to make mistakes, especially as children, and forgiveness can help move forward. But the author's stance is that the brother should face the consequences. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for refusing forgiveness. \n\nIf the brother's actions were a result of being influenced by family conflict and not malicious intent, then the author might not be in the wrong for not forgiving. However, cutting off a sibling for three years without any communication is harsh. But given the brother's age, maybe the author is within their rights to hold a grudge. \n\nThe answer likely depends on cultural or personal values. If the community values forgiveness and moving on, the author might be in the wrong. If the community values accountability for one's actions, even as a child, the author might not be in the wrong. The AITA (Am I the Asshole) context often leans towards understanding human behavior and empathy. \n\nThe brother's stepdad's confirmation that the mother wasn't involved suggests the brother made the choice independently. The author's refusal could be seen as strict, but also as standing by their decision. The author might not feel the need to forgive since the brother didn't make amends at the time. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have a valid reason to hold a grudge given the brother's decision and lack of communication. However, the answer might be nuanced. But based on the information, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
