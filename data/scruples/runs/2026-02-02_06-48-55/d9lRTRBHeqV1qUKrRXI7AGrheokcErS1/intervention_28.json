When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma\u2019s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn\u2019t want to see me anymore. \n\nI was upset but I gave him space thinking I\u2019d talk to him and explain he doesn\u2019t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it\u2019s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don\u2019t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn\u2019t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn\u2019t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for refusing to forgive their younger brother. The key points here are the context of the argument, the brother cutting off contact, and the refusal to reconcile after three years.\n\nFirst, the initial conflict was about a family dispute over Grandma's estate. The brother, at 12, took sides and cut off the author. The author tried to reach out but there was no response. Now, after three years, the brother wants to apologize, but the author refuses, emphasizing the age and consequences of actions.\n\nI need to consider the dynamics here. At 12, the brother might not have fully understood the implications of his actions. However, the author is holding onto the decision made back then, possibly seeing it as a betrayal. The mother's involvement is mentioned as not being part of the brother's decision, so he chose this on his own.\n\nThe author's stance is that the brother had a chance to talk it out back then and missed it, so now they're not obligated to forgive. But is that fair? Forgiveness isn't always required, but refusing it without some form of reconciliation attempt might be seen as harsh. The brother is making an effort now, yet the author is unwilling to engage, citing the time passed and the age. \n\nHowever, the author might be justified in feeling hurt and in needing time to heal. Yet, completely cutting off a sibling, especially when the other is reaching out, could be seen as not being open to reconciliation. The stepdad's confirmation that the mother wasn't involved adds that the brother made this choice independently, which the author is holding against him. \n\nBut is the author wrong for not forgiving? It's a personal decision. The question is about being in the wrong, not about what's morally right. The brother's actions three years ago were cutting off contact without explanation, and the author's refusal to reconcile now is a choice. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for not forgiving, but the question is whether their refusal is unjustified. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the brother's actions were immature, but the author's response of refusing to forgive could be seen as harsh. However, the author has the right to set boundaries. The key is whether the author is wrong for not extending forgiveness. Since forgiveness isn't a requirement, the author isn't in the wrong. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
