When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma\u2019s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn\u2019t want to see me anymore. \n\nI was upset but I gave him space thinking I\u2019d talk to him and explain he doesn\u2019t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it\u2019s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don\u2019t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn\u2019t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn\u2019t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to forgive their younger brother. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nSo, the author and their brother were close until three years ago. There's a backstory where the mom and author had a disagreement about Grandma's inheritance. The mom wanted to keep most of it, but Grandma wanted it donated. Then, after that argument, the brother (who was 12 at the time) cut off all contact\u2014Facebook, Snapchat, shared games. The author tried to reach out, but the brother didn't respond. Now, three years later, the brother wants to apologize, but the author refuses, saying the brother had a chance before and that 12 is old enough to face consequences. The author also mentions the mom excluded them from family, and the stepdad confirmed the brother acted on his own.\n\nThe user thinks the author might be wrong but wants to know my opinion. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nHmm. First, the brother was 12 when he cut off contact. At that age, even though kids can act impulsively, the author is holding it against him. But maybe the brother was influenced by his mom's actions, even if he made the choice independently. The author waited three years without contact, and the brother now wants to reconcile. The author is refusing because they feel the brother should have acted differently three years ago. But is forgiveness necessary here?\n\nForgiveness is a personal choice. The author might feel wronged, especially since they were close and this caused a complete cutoff. The brother's actions led to the family cutting the author off, which is a big deal. The author's reasoning is that the brother had a chance to talk it out before but didn't, so now he has to live with the consequences. However, the brother is trying to reach out now. Is the author being too rigid?\n\nOn one hand, the author might be justified in not immediately forgiving, especially if they felt betrayed and the brother didn't take responsibility back then. On the other hand, holding a grudge for three years without communication and then refusing to engage when the other person is trying to reconcile could be seen as harsh. The brother's age might be a mitigating factor\u2014he might not have fully understood the consequences at 12. The author is treating it as a conscious decision with real consequences, but maybe there's more nuance. \n\nAlso, the mom's role in the original conflict might have influenced the brother. Even though the stepdad confirmed the brother acted alone, the family dynamics here are complicated. The author's refusal might be a way to cope with the hurt, but completely cutting off all possibility of reconciliation could be seen as inconsiderate. However, the author has the right to set boundaries. If they don't feel safe or respected, forgiveness isn't mandatory. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's subjective. The author isn't legally wrong, but morally? It depends on perspective. The brother's actions were hurtful, but so was the author's refusal to engage when the brother is trying to make amends. Maybe the author is being too strict, but they have their reasons. The key is whether refusing forgiveness is the \"wrong\" thing. If the brother genuinely wants to apologize and the author is unyielding without dialogue, that could be seen as a problem. But if the author feels that the brother didn't take responsibility when it mattered and is now trying to backtrack, maybe the author is justified.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether forgiveness is expected. Since the author is choosing not to forgive, and it's their personal decision, they aren't necessarily in the wrong. But if others judge them for not being forgiving, that's different. The user might think the author is being too harsh, but in terms of being in the wrong, it's more about the author's right to their choice. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
