When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma\u2019s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn\u2019t want to see me anymore. \n\nI was upset but I gave him space thinking I\u2019d talk to him and explain he doesn\u2019t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it\u2019s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don\u2019t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn\u2019t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn\u2019t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's younger brother cut them off three years ago after an argument about their mom and Grandma's inheritance. The brother was 12 at the time, and the author is now refusing to forgive him, even though the brother wants to apologize now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the brother's age. He was 12 when he cut off the author. At that age, kids are still developing emotionally and might not fully understand the consequences of their actions. The brother might have been influenced by the family conflict and took drastic actions without realizing how it would affect his relationship with his sibling. \n\nThe author is holding a grudge because they feel the brother had a chance to reconcile three years ago but didn't take it. They're using the brother's age as a reason to not forgive him, implying that he should be held accountable for his actions. But is that fair? At 12, the brother might not have had the maturity to handle such a complex situation maturely. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is standing their ground, believing they have the right to be upset. They mention their mom cut them off the family tree, which adds to the hurt. The author's main point is that the brother chose to cut ties and now can't just seek forgiveness after three years. \n\nBut maybe forgiveness isn't about the brother's actions alone. It's also about the author's healing process. If the brother is genuinely remorseful and wants to make amends, is it fair for the author to completely refuse? The brother might not have had the opportunity to explain his side at the time, and now he's trying to do that. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that the brother should face the consequences of his actions. But does holding a grudge for three years serve any purpose? The author might be punishing the brother for something he did in his early teens, which could be seen as unfair given his age and emotional immaturity at the time. \n\nAlso, the stepdad confirmed that the mother wasn't involved, so the brother made the decision himself. That adds weight to the brother's accountability. However, if the brother was reacting to the family conflict, maybe he felt pressured or influenced by others. \n\nThe author says they don't feel the brother is entitled to forgiveness. That's their choice, but is it wrong to not offer forgiveness? It's possible, but the key is whether the author is overreacting. The user who posted thinks the author is in the wrong, suggesting that holding a grudge for three years is excessive. \n\nIn conclusion, considering the brother's age and the time that's passed, the author's refusal might be seen as too harsh. While the brother did make a choice to cut off, the author might be holding onto the hurt without allowing space for growth and reconciliation. So the author could be in the wrong by not being open to reconciliation, even if they're still upset.\n"
