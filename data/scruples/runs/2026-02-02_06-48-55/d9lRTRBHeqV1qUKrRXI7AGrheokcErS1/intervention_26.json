When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma\u2019s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn\u2019t want to see me anymore. \n\nI was upset but I gave him space thinking I\u2019d talk to him and explain he doesn\u2019t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it\u2019s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don\u2019t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn\u2019t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn\u2019t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the situation) is in the wrong for refusing to forgive their younger brother. \n\nFirst, the backstory: When the brother was 12 and the author 20, there was a fallout between the author and their mom over handling Grandma's inheritance. The brother then cut off contact, and after three years, he wants to apologize. The author refuses, saying the brother had a chance three years ago and that his actions had real consequences. The mother also cut the author off from the family tree.\n\nThe key points here are the brother's age (12), the sudden cutoff without explanation, and the author's refusal to forgive after three years. The author justifies this by saying the brother's actions had real consequences and that he's not entitled to forgiveness because he chose not to reconcile earlier.\n\nConsidering the brother's age, 12 might be too young to fully grasp the consequences of cutting off a sibling. Kids can act impulsively and then realize their mistakes later. The brother is now trying to apologize, which shows he might have matured and wants to make amends. The author's stance is about accountability, but forgiveness isn't a requirement. However, completely cutting someone off without any attempt to reconcile, even after years, might be seen as harsh, especially if the brother is trying to reach out now.\n\nThe author's position is that the brother had a chance before and didn't take it. But the brother was a child then, and now he's trying to make things right. The author's refusal could be seen as holding a grudge against a child's actions. However, the author's feelings are valid\u2014they might feel betrayed and hurt. The mother's involvement, cutting them off, adds complexity.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, forgiveness isn't a legal matter but a personal choice. The author isn't obligated to forgive, but the situation's nuances matter. If the brother was acting on his own at 12 and is now trying to apologize, the author's response might be seen as overly rigid. However, the author's decision to hold the line on accountability isn't necessarily wrong either. It's a balance between understanding past immaturity and seeking reconciliation now.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. The author isn't required to forgive, but their decision to refuse might be seen as harsh given the brother's age and current efforts to reconcile. But the author's stance on accountability is also understandable. The answer likely depends on whether the brother's actions were truly his own and if there's enough maturity now to justify forgiveness efforts. Since the brother was a child and is making amends, the author might be in the wrong for not considering growth and reconciliation. So, Answer A (author is in the wrong) might be appropriate here.\n"
