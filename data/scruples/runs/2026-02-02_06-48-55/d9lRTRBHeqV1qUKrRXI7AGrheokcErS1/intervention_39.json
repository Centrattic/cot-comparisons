When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma\u2019s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn\u2019t want to see me anymore. \n\nI was upset but I gave him space thinking I\u2019d talk to him and explain he doesn\u2019t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it\u2019s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don\u2019t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn\u2019t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn\u2019t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to forgive their younger brother. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the background: The author and their brother were close until three years ago when the brother cut off contact after a conflict involving the author's mom and a dispute over their grandma's inheritance. The brother was 12 at the time, and he took the author off social media and games. The author tried to reach out but got no response. Now, three years later, the brother wants to apologize, but the author refuses, saying the brother had a chance three years ago and that his actions at 12 have real consequences. The author also mentions the mother cut them off the family tree, and the stepdad confirmed it was the brother's decision.\n\nThe user thinks the author might be in the wrong, so I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the brother was 12, which is a young age where kids might act impulsively. His actions were a reaction to the conflict with their mom and the author. Cutting off contact at 12 could be seen as a childish reaction, and the brother is now trying to reconcile. The author is holding onto the past, possibly because they feel the brother didn't take responsibility or explain himself at the time. But the brother is now offering an apology, which the author is refusing to accept.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's stance is that the brother made a choice, and the author is holding them accountable. The author is emphasizing the age but also the consequences of actions. The brother's decision to cut off contact might be seen as a significant betrayal, especially if it's affecting the entire family. The author might feel that the brother should have taken responsibility sooner and that the time passed is a reason to not forgive. However, forgiveness is a personal choice, and the author isn't under any obligation to forgive, but the question is whether they're in the wrong for refusing.\n\nI need to consider if the author's refusal is justified. The brother was 12, which is a formative age, and maybe the author is being too strict. The brother is now trying to make amends, and the author's refusal might prevent healing. However, the author has a right to set boundaries. The mother cutting them off complicates things, but the author's decision to not forgive is their own. But if the brother's actions were a result of being influenced by their mom's conflict, maybe the author shouldn't hold the brother to the same standard as an adult. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's refusal is their personal choice, and they aren't necessarily in the wrong. However, some might argue that holding a grudge for three years over a brother's childhood actions is excessive. But the author's reasoning is based on the brother's choice and the consequences, so it's a nuanced situation. The key point is whether the author is in the wrong. Since forgiveness isn't a requirement, the answer might be that the author is not in the wrong (B), but some might argue they are (A). The user's initial thought is that the author might be wrong, but the analysis is balanced.\n"
