When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma\u2019s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn\u2019t want to see me anymore. \n\nI was upset but I gave him space thinking I\u2019d talk to him and explain he doesn\u2019t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it\u2019s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don\u2019t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn\u2019t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn\u2019t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for refusing to forgive their younger brother.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author and their brother were close until three years ago. The mother had a conflict with the author about honoring Grandma's wishes for her fortune. The brother, at 12, cut off contact with the author. The author tried to reach out but got no response. Now the brother wants to apologize after three years, but the author refuses, saying he had his chance and that 12 is old enough to face consequences. The author also mentions the mom cut them off the family tree.\n\nSo, the key points here. The brother blocked the author without explanation at 12, which is a significant age. The author tried to communicate but was ignored. Now, the brother is reaching out to apologize. The author is holding a grudge because of the initial decision, which they believe the brother should have known had consequences.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, forgiveness isn't something you can be \"in the wrong\" for not granting. People have the right to set boundaries. The brother's actions at 12 were abrupt and hurtful, and the author's refusal to reconcile might be seen as justified if they feel the brother didn't take responsibility then. However, the brother is now trying to apologize. The author might feel the delay is too long, but maybe that's their choice. The stepdad confirmed the mom wasn't involved, so it's the brother's own decision. The author's stance is that once you make a choice like that, you live with the consequences. That's a valid perspective. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the brother was a child at 12, maybe acting out due to family tensions, and that holding a grudge for three years is harsh. But the author is emphasizing the consequences of the brother's actions. The mom cutting the author off complicates it, but the author's decision to not forgive the brother might be about the brother's choice. \n\nSo, the author is choosing not to forgive, which is their right. They don't owe forgiveness. The brother's actions were part of a family conflict, and the author is prioritizing their own feelings. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
