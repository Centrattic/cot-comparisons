When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma\u2019s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn\u2019t want to see me anymore. \n\nI was upset but I gave him space thinking I\u2019d talk to him and explain he doesn\u2019t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it\u2019s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don\u2019t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn\u2019t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn\u2019t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a sibling conflict. The author and their younger brother were close until three years ago. The main issue started when their mom had a falling out with the author over Grandma's inheritance. The brother, who was 12 at the time, took the author off social media and games. The author tried to reach out but got no response. Now, after three years, the brother wants to apologize, but the author refuses to forgive, saying the brother had his chance and that his actions at 12 had real consequences.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the brother's age. At 12, he's a child, and while he made a choice, his maturity level might be lower. The author is now holding that against him, but does that make sense? Also, the brother initiated the cut-off, and the author tried to communicate. The brother didn't respond, which might have been due to his own emotional state or influence from the mother's side. The mother even cut the author off, according to the stepdad. \n\nThe author's refusal to forgive is based on the idea that the brother had a chance to reconcile but didn't. But three years later, the brother is trying to reach out. The author is emphasizing consequences, but is holding a child's decision for so long fair? The author might feel wronged, but relationships can be complex. The brother's actions were hurtful, but so was the author's refusal to accept an apology now. \n\nAlso, the mother's role in cutting the author off is a factor. The author might feel betrayed by both the brother and the mother. The author's stance is about accountability, but maybe they're being too rigid. Forgiveness isn't always required, but is the author's response justified? It's a tough call. On one hand, the brother made a choice, but at 12, maybe he didn't fully understand the impact. On the other hand, the author is within their rights to decide not to forgive. \n\nSo, is the author \"in the wrong\"? If the question is about whether refusing forgiveness is wrong, it's subjective. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong because forgiveness is a personal choice. However, the situation could be seen as harsh if the brother is genuinely trying to make amends. But given the brother's initial decision and the author's reasoning, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. So the answer might be B.\n"
