When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma\u2019s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn\u2019t want to see me anymore. \n\nI was upset but I gave him space thinking I\u2019d talk to him and explain he doesn\u2019t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it\u2019s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don\u2019t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn\u2019t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn\u2019t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for refusing to forgive their younger brother. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the backstory: The brother and sister were close until an argument about donating their grandmother's fortune. The brother, at 12 years old, cut all contact with the sister. She tried to reach out but he didn't respond for three years. Now he wants to apologize, but she refuses forgiveness, saying he had a chance three years ago and that his actions had real consequences. The stepdad confirms the mom wasn't involved, so it was the brother's decision.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Let me think about possible angles. Forgiveness is a personal choice, and people have different thresholds for what they consider forgivable. The brother was 12 at the time, which is a child, but kids can still make hurtful decisions. However, cutting off contact and not responding for three years might have been a significant action for a child. The sister argues that he chose to isolate himself and now can't expect forgiveness after all this time.\n\nOn the other hand, some might say that even if he made a mistake as a child, he's now trying to make amends. The sister might be holding a grudge, which isn't necessarily wrong, but some could argue that forgiveness is important for family relationships. But others might support her stance that he should have come forward when he had the chance.\n\nThe user's response options are A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong). The sister's reasoning is that he had a chance to explain three years ago but didn't. She's choosing not to forgive because of that. The brother's actions as a child led to a three-year silence. \n\nI think the key here is the concept of forgiveness and whether it's reasonable to expect someone to forgive after such a long time, especially when there was no clear explanation at the time. The sister's decision is her right, and she's not obligated to forgive. So she's not in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
