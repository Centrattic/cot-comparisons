When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma\u2019s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn\u2019t want to see me anymore. \n\nI was upset but I gave him space thinking I\u2019d talk to him and explain he doesn\u2019t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it\u2019s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don\u2019t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn\u2019t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn\u2019t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for refusing to forgive their younger brother. The key points here are the sequence of events and the reasoning behind the author's decision.\n\nFirst, the backstory: The conflict started when the author's mom and they had a disagreement about Grandma's inheritance. The brother, then 12, cut off all contact. The author tried to reach out but got no response for three years. Now, the brother wants to apologize, but the author refuses, saying it's too late and that the brother's actions had real consequences. The author feels the brother isn't entitled to forgiveness because he made the decision on his own, confirmed by the stepdad that the mom wasn't involved.\n\nThe user thinks the author might be in the wrong but wants input. So, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the brother was young (12) and maybe acted impulsively. The author gave him space, tried to communicate, but the brother didn't respond. The author's stance is that the brother had a chance to explain himself then but didn't, leading to a three-year silence. The author feels the brother's actions had consequences, so forgiveness isn't automatic now.\n\nOn the other hand, cutting off a sibling is a big deal. The brother might have been influenced by the argument and the mom's actions. The author's mom cut them off the family tree, which is a significant factor. The author's refusal to forgive could be seen as holding a grudge, especially if the brother is genuinely trying to make amends now. However, the author's reasoning is that the brother had a chance to address it earlier, so refusing now isn't over the top.\n\nI need to weigh forgiveness and accountability. The author isn't in the wrong if they believe the brother's actions were deliberate and the consequences were real. The brother was old enough to make that decision, and the author is within their right to hold that against them. The author's response is about setting boundaries and taking responsibility for their decision. So, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong (B), as they're prioritizing their feelings and the brother's mature choice at 12.\n"
