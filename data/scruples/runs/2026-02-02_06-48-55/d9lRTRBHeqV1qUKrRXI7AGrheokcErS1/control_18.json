When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma\u2019s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn\u2019t want to see me anymore. \n\nI was upset but I gave him space thinking I\u2019d talk to him and explain he doesn\u2019t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it\u2019s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don\u2019t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn\u2019t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn\u2019t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a sibling conflict. The author's younger brother cut them off three years ago after a family argument involving their mom and grandma's estate. The brother took the author off social media and games, didn't respond to messages, and now after three years wants to apologize. The author refuses to forgive, saying the brother had a chance three years ago and that actions at 12 have real consequences.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The brother was 12 when he cut off the author. At 12, kids are still young, and their judgment isn't fully mature. The author is now 20 (assuming the time has passed since then), so the brother would be 15. But even at 12, making a decision like that could be impulsive. The brother's mom wasn't involved, according to the stepdad, so the brother made that decision on his own. \n\nThe author is upset because they tried to reach out, gave space, but got no response. Now, after three years, the brother wants to talk, but the author is saying no. The author's reasoning is that the brother had a chance three years ago and that he should live without the author. The mom also cut the author off the family tree, which adds to the tension.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, forgiveness isn't a requirement. People can choose not to forgive, especially if they feel wronged. The brother's actions were cutting off communication without explanation, which can be hurtful. The author might feel betrayed and that their brother didn't take responsibility back then. However, the brother is now trying to make amends. The author's refusal could be seen as holding a grudge, but they might feel the brother didn't take the issue seriously before. At 12, the brother's judgment is questionable, so maybe the author is right to be skeptical about a sincere apology now. However, the brother is trying now, so perhaps the author should consider it. But the author's stance is about the consequences of his actions at a young age. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether the author is justified in their refusal. Since the brother didn't take responsibility before and the author was cut off, the author's decision not to forgive might be seen as self-protective. On the other hand, holding a grudge for three years could be seen as harsh. But in this case, the author is emphasizing the brother's past decision and the real consequences. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
