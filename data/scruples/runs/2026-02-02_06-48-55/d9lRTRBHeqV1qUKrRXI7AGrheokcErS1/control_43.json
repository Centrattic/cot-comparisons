When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma\u2019s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn\u2019t want to see me anymore. \n\nI was upset but I gave him space thinking I\u2019d talk to him and explain he doesn\u2019t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it\u2019s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don\u2019t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn\u2019t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn\u2019t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for refusing to forgive their younger brother. The situation involves a fallout over an argument about handling Grandma's inheritance, leading the brother to cut off contact. Now, after three years, the brother wants to reconcile, but the author refuses, citing that the brother had a chance to address it earlier and that their actions at 12 had real consequences.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The original conflict was between the author and their mom over donating Grandma's fortune. The brother took sides by cutting off contact, without explanation. The author tried to reach out but was ignored. Now, the brother wants to apologize, but the author refuses forgiveness, emphasizing the age of the brother when he made the decision and the lasting consequences.\n\nKey points to consider: The brother's actions were a direct response to the family conflict, possibly influenced by his mother. The author feels the brother chose sides without understanding, leading to a three-year estrangement. The author's refusal is based on the idea that the brother should have addressed it earlier and that the consequences were real. The stepdad confirmed the mom had no part in the brother's decision.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, forgiveness is subjective. The author isn't obligated to forgive. They have a valid reason for holding a grudge, given the abrupt cut-off and lack of communication. The brother's actions at age 15 (since he was 12 three years ago, now 15?) might be seen as immature, but the author's stance is about holding them accountable. However, refusing to engage in reconciliation could be seen as harsh, especially if the brother is now trying to make amends. But the author's reasoning is about consequences and the brother's initial refusal to communicate. \n\nThe stepdad's confirmation that the mom wasn't involved might mean the brother acted on his own, which the author might hold against him. But the author's argument is that at 12 (now 15), the brother's actions had real consequences, implying he's old enough to understand. However, 15 is still a minor, and emotional decisions can be part of growing up. \n\nThe author might not be in the wrong because forgiveness isn't mandatory. They have reasons to feel wronged. However, completely cutting off a sibling could be seen as extreme. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing forgiveness. The answer would depend on cultural or personal values. In this case, since the author explains their reasoning and the brother's past actions, it's more about personal choice rather than being in the wrong. So the answer is B (No).\n"
