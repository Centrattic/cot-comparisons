When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma\u2019s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn\u2019t want to see me anymore. \n\nI was upset but I gave him space thinking I\u2019d talk to him and explain he doesn\u2019t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it\u2019s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don\u2019t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn\u2019t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn\u2019t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong for refusing to forgive their younger brother. The situation is that the brother cut off contact after a family argument about a grandmother's will. The author tried to reconnect but the brother didn't respond. Now, three years later, the brother wants to apologize, but the author refuses, saying he had a chance before.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The brother was 12 when he cut off contact. At that age, kids might not fully understand the consequences of their actions. The author was 20 at the time, so they were an adult. The argument was between the mother and the author about the grandmother's will, which might have influenced the brother's decision. The stepdad confirmed the mom wasn't involved in the brother's decision, so it was the brother's own choice.\n\nThe author is now standing by their decision, emphasizing that the brother should have known better. The brother is trying to apologize now, but the author feels it's too late. The mom even cut the author off from the family tree. The author doesn't think the brother deserves forgiveness because he didn't reach out earlier.\n\nI need to determine if the author is wrong. Forgiveness is a personal choice, and everyone has their own boundaries. The brother's actions were childish, but he was a child himself at the time. The author might be holding onto hurt feelings, but it's their right to decide how to handle it. However, some might argue that refusing forgiveness now without considering the brother's growth could be rigid. The brother is trying to reconcile, which shows he might have matured. The author's stance is that the brother should face the consequences, but maybe the brother has learned from his actions.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's refusal could be seen as justified because the brother didn't take responsibility sooner. The author gave him space, but the brother didn't respond. The author's feelings are valid, and they have the right to set boundaries. However, some might say that forgiveness is important, especially in family relationships. But the author is not obligated to forgive; it's their choice.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have the right to decide their own feelings and boundaries. The brother made a decision when he was young, and the author is holding him accountable. The answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
