When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma\u2019s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn\u2019t want to see me anymore. \n\nI was upset but I gave him space thinking I\u2019d talk to him and explain he doesn\u2019t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it\u2019s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don\u2019t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn\u2019t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn\u2019t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a brother cutting off contact three years ago over a family conflict involving their mom and grandma's estate. The author is the older sibling who didn't forgive the younger brother and is now being asked if that's wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The younger brother took the author off social media and games after a fallout where the mom and author disagreed about donating Grandma's money. The brother didn't respond to messages, and now three years later, he wants to apologize. The author refused, saying he had a chance three years ago and that a 12-year-old's actions have real consequences. The author also mentions the stepdad confirmed the mom had no part in this, so it was the brother's decision. The author feels the brother isn't entitled to forgiveness and the mom cut them off.\n\nSo, the author's reasoning is that the brother made a choice and now must live with the consequences. They're holding a grudge because the brother didn't reach out after the initial hurt. The user who posted the question thinks the author might be wrong, but I need to decide if they are.\n\nI should consider the age here. The brother was 12 when this happened, which is a child. Children can make immature decisions, especially in emotional family situations. The author is now 23, three years later. Is three years too long to hold a grudge? Well, forgiveness isn't always necessary, but the situation might have been different if the brother had tried to reconcile sooner. However, he did reach out now to apologize, which the author rejected.\n\nThe author's stance is that the brother had a chance to talk it out before but didn't take it. The author's response is firm, emphasizing consequences. But is it fair to withhold forgiveness indefinitely? The brother was a child, so maybe the author is being too strict. Also, the mother cut the author off by removing them from the family tree, which adds to the complexity. The author might be feeling hurt and betrayed, not just by the brother but the entire family situation.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has a right to set boundaries. If the brother didn't reach out for three years, maybe the author is justified in needing time to heal and not feeling obligated to accept an apology now. However, the brother is trying to make amends, and the author's refusal might prevent reconciliation. The question is whether the author's refusal is wrong.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, holding a grudge for three years over a child's action might be seen as harsh. Also, the brother taking the initiative to apologize now shows he might have matured. The author's response could be seen as closing the door on potential healing. But the author also has the right to decide their own boundaries and not feel forced to forgive. It's a balance between accountability and forgiveness.\n\nI think the key here is whether the author's refusal is inconsiderate. The brother was young, and the author is applying adult consequences to a child's action. The author might be right in not feeling obligated to forgive, but the way they cut off any chance for reconciliation could be seen as wrong. The answer might hinge on whether forgiveness is a moral obligation. Since it's not, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. But if the refusal is due to excessive pride or refusal to move past the issue, that's a different matter. Considering all this, I think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they are setting boundaries and have the right to decide their response to the brother's actions.\n"
