When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma\u2019s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn\u2019t want to see me anymore. \n\nI was upset but I gave him space thinking I\u2019d talk to him and explain he doesn\u2019t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it\u2019s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don\u2019t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn\u2019t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn\u2019t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for refusing to forgive their younger brother.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The brother and sister were close until three years ago. The conflict started when the sister had a falling out with their mom about donating Grandma's fortune. The brother, at 12, took her off social media and games. She tried to reach out but got no response. Now, three years later, he wants to apologize, but she refuses, saying he had a chance before and should face consequences. The mom cut her off the family tree, and the stepdad confirmed the brother acted alone.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for not forgiving. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). \n\nSo, what's important here? The brother was 12 when he cut off contact. At that age, can he be held fully responsible? Maybe the sister is strict, thinking he should take responsibility for his actions. But at 12, kids might not fully understand the consequences of their actions. The sister is now 23 (since she was 20 three years ago), and the brother is 15. He might have matured. \n\nThe sister's reasoning is that he made a decision and should face real consequences. She's giving him a lesson about responsibility. However, some might argue that holding a grudge for three years is too harsh, especially if the brother is trying to make amends now. The mom's involvement in cutting her off also complicates things. \n\nBut the sister's stance is that the brother had the chance to talk it out before but didn't. Now, she's firm on her position. The stepdad confirmed the brother acted alone. The sister might feel betrayed and that her brother took her side (though maybe he didn't, but the sister thinks he should have chosen her). \n\nIn terms of moral judgment, some might say the sister has a right to be upset and set boundaries. Others might think that forgiveness is important, especially since the brother is trying to reconcile now. But the sister's point about the age and consequences is valid. At 12, maybe he didn't understand the impact of his actions. However, three years is a long time, and the sister's refusal could be seen as extreme. \n\nI think it's a bit of a gray area, but the key points are his age at the time, his current attempt to apologize, and her reasoning about consequences. Since he was a child and might not have fully comprehended the situation, the sister's decision to not forgive immediately might be seen as reasonable for teaching accountability. But holding on for three years without any communication could be seen as harsh. However, given that the brother didn't reach out again and the sister felt he should take responsibility, her stance might be justified. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (no, she's not in the wrong). She's choosing to hold him accountable for his actions, even if it's difficult. The brother's age is a factor, but she's making a point about consequences. Therefore, she's not necessarily wrong for setting that boundary.\n"
