When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma\u2019s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn\u2019t want to see me anymore. \n\nI was upset but I gave him space thinking I\u2019d talk to him and explain he doesn\u2019t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it\u2019s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don\u2019t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn\u2019t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn\u2019t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is between two siblings. The author and their younger brother were really close until three years ago. The problem started when their mom and the author had a falling out about donating their grandma's money. The brother, at 12, took the author off social media and games. The author tried to reach out, but the brother didn't respond. Now, after three years, the brother wants to apologize, but the author refuses, saying the brother had a chance before and should have learned from his actions.\n\nHmm, the key points here are about forgiveness and maturity. The brother was 12 when he cut off contact, which is a young age, but the author argues that at 12, actions have consequences. The brother's stepdad confirmed the mom wasn't involved, so it was the brother's decision. The author feels the brother isn't entitled to forgiveness because he didn't act then. Also, the mom cut the author off, but that's probably a separate issue.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, the brother did reach out after three years to apologize. The author's stance is about holding the brother accountable for past actions. But some might say holding a grudge for three years is harsh, especially since the brother is trying to make amends. However, others might agree that if someone cuts you off without communication and then expects forgiveness after years, that's not fair. The author's reasoning is that the brother should deal with the consequences, which might be valid given his age at the time. But maybe the author could have given the brother another chance since he's trying to reconcile now. \n\nI think it's a bit of a gray area. The brother was young and impulsive, but the author has a right to feel hurt. The author's decision to not forgive might be seen as justified if they believe the brother should have taken responsibility earlier. However, refusing to consider reconciliation now could be seen as withholding grace. But given the information, the author's position seems reasonable because the brother didn't communicate then, and the author is standing by their decision. So maybe the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
