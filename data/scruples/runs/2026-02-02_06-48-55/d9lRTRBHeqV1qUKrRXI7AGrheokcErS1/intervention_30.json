When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma\u2019s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn\u2019t want to see me anymore. \n\nI was upset but I gave him space thinking I\u2019d talk to him and explain he doesn\u2019t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it\u2019s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don\u2019t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn\u2019t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn\u2019t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to forgive their younger brother. The situation is that the brother cut off contact after a disagreement about their grandma's inheritance. The author tried to reach out but the brother didn't respond, and now three years later, he wants to apologize. The author refused, saying he had a chance three years ago and that actions at 12 have consequences.\n\nHmm. First, the brother was 12 when he cut off contact. At that age, kids are still developing their understanding of relationships and consequences. The author is 20, so there's an 8-year age gap. The brother might not have fully grasped the impact of his actions back then. Also, the mom was involved in the initial conflict, which might have influenced the brother's decision.\n\nThe author is holding onto the past. While the brother's actions were hurtful, refusing forgiveness indefinitely could be seen as harsh. The brother is now trying to reach out, showing some maturity by wanting to apologize. The author's response that the brother can survive without him more is a bit cold. Forgiveness isn't always about the offender's actions but also about the forgiver's healing. \n\nBut the author did give him space and tried to communicate. The brother didn't respond for three years, which might have contributed to the author's stance. The author might feel wronged because there was no explanation or apology at the time. However, holding a grudge for three years just because the brother was 12 could be seen as excessive. People make mistakes at a young age, and expecting immediate reconciliation might not be fair. \n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't obligated to forgive. The brother made a choice without understanding, and the author's right to set boundaries is valid. But forgiveness can be part of moving forward, even if it's not reconciliation. The author might be in the wrong if they're unwilling to consider the brother's growth and current attempt to make amends. \n\nI think the key points are the brother's age, the author's stance on consequences, and the refusal to engage now despite an apology. The author's position is justified in some ways, but their refusal to consider forgiveness might be seen as harsh. However, it's their choice, and they aren't in the wrong legally or morally. But emotionally, maybe they could show more empathy. The answer is probably B (Not in the wrong) because they have a right to their feelings, but the reasoning is nuanced.\n"
