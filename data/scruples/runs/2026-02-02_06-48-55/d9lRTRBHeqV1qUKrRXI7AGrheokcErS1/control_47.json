When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma\u2019s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn\u2019t want to see me anymore. \n\nI was upset but I gave him space thinking I\u2019d talk to him and explain he doesn\u2019t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it\u2019s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don\u2019t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn\u2019t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn\u2019t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to forgive their younger brother. The situation is that the brother cut off contact after a family argument about their grandmother's inheritance. The author tried to reach out but the brother didn't respond for three years. Now the brother wants to apologize, but the author refuses, saying he had a chance to talk it out before.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The brother was 12 when he cut off contact, which is a young age. The author is questioning whether their brother's actions at 12 mean he deserves forgiveness. The author's stance is that actions have consequences, especially at that age, and that the brother should have taken responsibility earlier. The stepdad confirmed the mom wasn't involved, so it was the brother's decision alone.\n\nNow, thinking about forgiveness. Forgiveness is a personal choice, and the author isn't obligated to forgive. The brother's actions were cutting off communication, which is hurtful. However, the brother is now trying to reach out after three years. The author's refusal could be seen as holding a grudge, but the author feels justified because the brother didn't take the first step earlier.\n\nAlso, the mother cutting the author off from the family tree adds to the complexity. The author might feel betrayed by both the brother and the mother. The brother's age at the time might be relevant; at 12, kids can be impulsive. But the author is emphasizing that he's now 15 (assuming 3 years passed) and should understand consequences.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author is not legally or morally obligated to forgive. The brother did make the first move to apologize now. But the author's reasoning is that the brother had a chance before and didn't take it. The author is using the brother's age as a factor in the consequences. The answer might depend on cultural views on forgiveness and family dynamics.\n\nHowever, holding a grudge for three years over a childhood action could be seen as harsh. The brother is trying to mend the relationship now, which is positive. The author's refusal might be seen as not allowing reconciliation. But the author has valid reasons: the brother didn't communicate, the mother cut them off, and the author feels wronged.\n\nIn summary, the author's decision to not forgive is their choice, but whether they're in the wrong is another matter. Since forgiveness isn't a requirement, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
