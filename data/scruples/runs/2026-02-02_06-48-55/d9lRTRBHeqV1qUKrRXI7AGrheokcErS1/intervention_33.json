When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma\u2019s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn\u2019t want to see me anymore. \n\nI was upset but I gave him space thinking I\u2019d talk to him and explain he doesn\u2019t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it\u2019s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don\u2019t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn\u2019t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn\u2019t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to forgive their younger brother. The situation involves a fallout over a family argument about a grandmother's estate, which led the brother to cut off contact. Now, after three years, the brother wants to reconcile, but the author refuses.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is 20 years old when the argument happens, and the brother is 12. At 12, a child's decision to cut off contact might be influenced by their mom, as mentioned by the stepdad. The author feels the brother chose sides without understanding and is holding him accountable for the consequences of his actions at that age.\n\nThe brother wants to apologize now, but the author is refusing, saying the brother had his chance three years ago. The key points here are the age of the brother when he acted, the fact that the mother was involved, and the author's stance on forgiveness. The author believes he's not obligated to forgive and that the brother should live with the consequences.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, forgiveness is a personal choice, and the author isn't obligated to forgive. However, the brother was young, and his actions might have been influenced by his mother. The author is emphasizing accountability, which could be seen as justified. On the other hand, cutting off a sibling for three years might be harsh, but the author's reasoning is that the brother made a decision and must face the consequences.\n\nThere's no clear right or wrong here. The author's perspective is that the brother's actions had real consequences, and they're choosing not to let go of that. The brother's age and possible influence from the mother might mitigate some blame. However, the author's stance is about respect for their own feelings and the decision made at the time. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
