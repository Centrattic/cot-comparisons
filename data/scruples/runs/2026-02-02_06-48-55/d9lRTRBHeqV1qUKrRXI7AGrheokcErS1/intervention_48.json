When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma\u2019s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn\u2019t want to see me anymore. \n\nI was upset but I gave him space thinking I\u2019d talk to him and explain he doesn\u2019t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it\u2019s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don\u2019t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn\u2019t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn\u2019t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for refusing to forgive their younger brother. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the backstory: the author and their brother were close until three years ago. The conflict started after the author had a falling out with their mom about donating their grandma's fortune. The brother, at 12, cut off all contact. The author tried to reach out but got no response. Now, after three years, the brother wants to apologize, but the author refuses, saying the brother had a chance to reconcile back then and should face consequences.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that at 12, the brother's actions have real consequences. They also mention their mom excluded them from the family. The user thinks the author might be wrong but is unsure.\n\nHmm, so is the author in the wrong? Let's consider both sides. On one hand, the brother made a choice to cut off contact when he was 12, which is a significant age but still a child. The author gave him space but he didn't respond. Now, after three years, the brother wants to reconcile. The author is holding a grudge for not taking responsibility back then.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is emphasizing accountability. They feel that the brother should have known better, even as a child, and that three years is enough time to move on. The author might be protecting themselves from potential future hurt, especially after the mother's actions.\n\nBut wait, forgiveness isn't always about the other person's actions. It's also about the person's own healing. The author might be struggling with their own feelings of rejection or pain. However, holding a grudge for three years could be seen as harsh. The brother, as a child, might not have fully understood the consequences of his actions. The author's refusal might prevent reconciliation and healing for both sides.\n\nAlso, the mother cutting the author off complicates things. The author might be using the brother's actions as a way to deal with their own family's rejection. But does that justify withholding forgiveness? Maybe not entirely. It's a complex situation where both parties have their own perspectives.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks for understanding both sides. The author's stance is about accountability, but maybe they're being too strict. The brother is trying to apologize now, which shows maturity. The author's refusal might be seen as not allowing room for growth. However, the author has the right to set boundaries, especially if they feel hurt.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might not necessarily be in the wrong. They have a right to their feelings and boundaries. However, there's a case to be made that forgiveness is a personal choice and not always owed. The answer could be B, the author is not in the wrong, because they are prioritizing their own emotional well-being and holding the brother accountable for his past actions.\n"
