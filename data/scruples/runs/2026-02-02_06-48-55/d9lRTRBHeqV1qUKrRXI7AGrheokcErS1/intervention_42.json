When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma\u2019s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn\u2019t want to see me anymore. \n\nI was upset but I gave him space thinking I\u2019d talk to him and explain he doesn\u2019t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it\u2019s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don\u2019t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn\u2019t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn\u2019t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for refusing to forgive their younger brother. Let me break down the situation.\n\nSo, the author and their brother were close until three years ago. There was an argument between the author's mom and the author about distributing Grandma's money. The mom wanted to keep most of it, but Grandma wanted it donated. Then, the brother, who was 12 at the time, cut off all contact through social media and games. The author tried to reach out, but the brother didn't respond. Now, after three years, the brother wants to apologize, but the author refuses, saying he had a chance three years ago and that actions at 12 have real consequences. The brother's stepdad confirmed the mom wasn't involved, so the brother made the decision on his own. The author's mom also cut the author off from the family tree.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the brother when he cut off contact. He was 12, which is a child. At that age, emotional maturity isn't fully developed. Maybe the brother didn't fully understand the consequences of his actions. The author is now 23 (since the current time is three years after the incident when the brother was 12, so the brother is now 15). The author is holding him to a standard of accountability that might be too high for a teenager.\n\nThe brother is trying to reach out now, three years later. The author is refusing to forgive, saying the brother had a chance before. But the brother was 12 and didn't respond to messages. Maybe at 12, he was acting out of anger or influenced by his mom, but he's changed now. The author might be using the brother's past immaturity to justify not forgiving him, which could be harsh.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't get a real explanation from the brother before. The brother just cut off contact. Now he's willing to apologize. Shouldn't the author at least consider that? Also, the mother cut the author out of the family tree, which might have added to the tension. The author might be holding onto the anger and not allowing for reconciliation.\n\nIs forgiveness a right or a choice? The author isn't obligated to forgive, but sometimes people expect some willingness to listen. However, the brother did take the initiative to apologize now. The author's stance is that the brother made a decision and should live with the consequences, but the author is also cutting contact, which affects both sides.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, holding a grudge for three years because of a child's decision might be seen as the author being in the wrong. The brother is making an effort to make amends, which the author is refusing. The author could be seen as not allowing the brother to grow from his past mistakes.\n\nAlternatively, the author might feel wronged and justified in their stance. But the key here is the brother's age and the possibility of personal growth. The author is not wrong in feeling hurt, but refusing to even consider forgiveness might be where they go overboard. The author's reasoning is that the brother had a chance before, but the brother was a child then. The author's decision to cut contact now might be seen as the wrong move because it prevents reconciliation. So, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because they're not allowing for the brother's growth and the opportunity to make things right now.\n"
