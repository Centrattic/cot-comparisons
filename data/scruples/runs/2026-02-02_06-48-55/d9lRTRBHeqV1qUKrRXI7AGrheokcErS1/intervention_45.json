When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma\u2019s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn\u2019t want to see me anymore. \n\nI was upset but I gave him space thinking I\u2019d talk to him and explain he doesn\u2019t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it\u2019s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don\u2019t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn\u2019t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn\u2019t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for refusing to forgive their younger brother. The situation involves a fallout over a family argument regarding their grandmother's estate. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the key points: The siblings were close until three years ago. The mom had a conflict with the narrator about donating grandma's fortune. The brother, at 12, cut off contact. The narrator tried to reach out but got no response. Now, after three years, the brother wants to apologize, but the narrator refuses, emphasizing that at 12, he should understand consequences. The mom excluded the narrator from the family tree.\n\nThe user thinks the author might be wrong, but wants my opinion. So, I need to evaluate if the narrator is in the wrong for not forgiving. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, forgiveness is often seen as virtuous, but it's not mandatory. The brother's actions were abrupt and maybe impulsive for a 12-year-old. However, cutting someone out for three years is significant. The narrator is holding the brother accountable for his choice, which could be justified. The brother's stepdad confirmed the mom had no part in the decision, so the brother acted on his own.\n\nBut is the narrator being too harsh? At 12, kids are still developing emotional maturity. The brother might not fully grasp the long-term impact of his actions. The narrator's stance is that the brother should face consequences, which is reasonable. However, completely cutting off contact might be seen as extreme, especially since the brother is now seeking reconciliation.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the mother cutting the narrator off, which adds to the emotional weight. The narrator's refusal could be a way of asserting boundaries after being wronged. But does that justify not offering a chance for reconciliation when the brother is reaching out now?\n\nDifferent perspectives here. Some might argue that holding a grudge for three years is unfair, especially given the brother's age and possible immaturity. Others might say the narrator is within their right to set boundaries, especially if the brother didn't take responsibility until now.\n\nThe question is whether the narrator is in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether forgiveness is expected in this context. Since the narrator has the right to decide whom they want to forgive, their choice isn't necessarily wrong. However, some might see it as an overreaction. But the key is the brother's initial decision to cut off without explanation, and the narrator's consistent stance on consequences. So, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
