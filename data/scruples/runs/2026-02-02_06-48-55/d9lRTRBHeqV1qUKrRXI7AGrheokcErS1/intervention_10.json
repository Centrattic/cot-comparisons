When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma\u2019s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn\u2019t want to see me anymore. \n\nI was upset but I gave him space thinking I\u2019d talk to him and explain he doesn\u2019t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it\u2019s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don\u2019t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn\u2019t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn\u2019t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for refusing to forgive their younger brother. The situation involves a fallout between siblings after a disagreement about their grandmother's inheritance. The brother cut off contact three years ago, and now wants to apologize, but the author refuses to forgive, saying the brother had his chance.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The brother was 12 when he cut off contact. At that age, while children can have strong emotions, their understanding of consequences and maturity might be limited. The author is holding a three-year grudge, which is a long time. The brother is now reaching out to apologize, and the author is refusing, emphasizing that the brother made a choice and must live with the consequences. The mother also cut the author off, which adds to the complexity.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. I should think about forgiveness and the context of the brother's age. At 12, his actions might not reflect the same level of maturity as an adult. The author is saying that the brother's actions had real consequences, but is it fair to hold a child's decision from three years ago against them indefinitely? Also, the author didn't get an explanation initially, but now the brother wants to talk. Shouldn't the author consider the apology and the brother's current intentions?\n\nHowever, the author might feel betrayed, especially since the brother chose sides without explanation. The mother's involvement in cutting the author off complicates things. The stepdad confirmed the mother wasn't involved, so the brother acted on his own. The author is justified in feeling hurt, but forgiveness is a personal choice. Refusing forgiveness isn't necessarily wrong, but is the author overreacting? Some might say that holding a grudge for three years without any contact is extreme, especially if the brother is trying to make amends now.\n\nOn the other hand, the brother had a chance to reach out earlier but didn't, now he's reaching out after three years. The author is holding him accountable for past actions. The key here is whether the author is in the wrong for not accepting the apology. If the brother genuinely wanted to reconcile earlier but couldn't, maybe the author is being too rigid. But if the brother just left without explanation and now wants to come back, the author has every right to be wary.\n\nI think there's no absolute right or wrong here, but given the situation, the author's decision to refuse forgiveness might be seen as justified because the brother made a choice to cut ties without explanation. However, some might argue that forgiveness is important regardless of the past. But since the author is standing by their decision based on the brother's actions three years ago, maybe they are not in the wrong. Alternatively, maybe the author is being too harsh because the brother was a child and is now trying to make amends. Hmm. I'm a bit torn. But given the details, the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong (B) because they are holding their brother accountable for his past actions, even if it's a difficult decision. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check again. The brother was 12, maybe the author is being too strict. But the author is emphasizing consequences. Maybe the answer is B, no, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
