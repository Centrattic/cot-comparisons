When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma\u2019s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn\u2019t want to see me anymore. \n\nI was upset but I gave him space thinking I\u2019d talk to him and explain he doesn\u2019t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it\u2019s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don\u2019t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn\u2019t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn\u2019t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the question is whether they're justified in refusing to forgive their brother after he cut them off three years ago.\n\nFirst, let's recap the situation. The author and their brother were very close until three years ago. The mother had a conflict with the author over handling their grandma's estate. The brother, who was 12 at the time, suddenly blocked the author on social media and games. The author tried to reach out but got no response. Now, three years later, the brother wants to apologize and talk, but the author refuses, saying the brother had a chance to do that before and should face the consequences. The author's mom also cut them off from the family tree.\n\nSo, the key points here are the age of the brother when he cut off contact, the author's refusal to forgive, and the fact that the brother didn't reach out until now. The author is arguing that at 12, the brother should have known the consequences of his actions and that three years is enough time to survive without each other.\n\nI need to consider if the author's response is reasonable. Forgiveness is a personal choice, and people have different boundaries. The brother's initial decision to cut off contact without explanation could be seen as impulsive, especially at 12. However, the author is holding them to an account for past actions. \n\nBut why is the author refusing to engage now? They might feel that the brother didn't take responsibility then and is only doing so now, perhaps to ease his own guilt. The author's stance is that there's a time limit on accountability. On the other hand, the brother might be genuinely remorseful and wants to reconcile. The author's right to set boundaries is valid, but is it wrong to refuse forgiveness?\n\nAnother angle: The mother's role in cutting off the author complicates things. The author might be hurt by both the brother and the mother. But the question is about the author's actions, not the mother's. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for not forgiving? If forgiveness is expected regardless of the brother's actions and the time passed, then the author might be in the wrong. But if the author is within their rights to set boundaries and choose when or if to forgive, then they aren't wrong. \n\nAlso, considering the brother's age. At 12, he might not have had the emotional maturity to handle the situation well. The author might be taking the high road by not forcing a reconciliation. However, some might argue that holding a grudge for three years is excessive. \n\nBut the author isn't holding a grudge; they're choosing not to forgive because the brother didn't take responsibility when he had the chance. The author is prioritizing their own emotional well-being. \n\nSo, in conclusion, the author's actions are a personal choice, and as long as they're not causing harm without reason, they're not in the wrong. The brother's actions were unexplained and sudden, and the author is within their right to decide not to forgive. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
