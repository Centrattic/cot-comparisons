When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma\u2019s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn\u2019t want to see me anymore. \n\nI was upset but I gave him space thinking I\u2019d talk to him and explain he doesn\u2019t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it\u2019s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don\u2019t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn\u2019t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn\u2019t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for refusing to forgive their younger brother.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The siblings were close until three years ago. The mother had a falling out with the narrator over Grandma's inheritance. The brother then cut off communication. The narrator tried to reach out, but the brother didn't respond. Now, after three years, the brother wants to apologize, but the narrator refuses forgiveness, saying he should have acted differently when he was 12. The mother cut the narrator off the family tree.\n\nSo, the key points are: the brother's sudden cutoff, the mother's role in the initial conflict, the brother's lack of communication for three years, and the narrator's refusal to forgive now.\n\nThe narrator's reasoning is that the brother, at 12, made a choice with real consequences. They feel the brother isn't entitled to forgiveness because he didn't reach out earlier. The stepdad confirmed the mom had no part in the brother's decision. Also, the mother cut ties.\n\nTo determine if the narrator is in the wrong, I need to consider intentions and actions. Was the brother's cutoff justified? At 12, is he mature enough to understand the impact? The brother might have been influenced by family dynamics. The narrator tried to give space but got no response, leading to three years of silence. Now the brother wants to reconcile, but the narrator is holding a grudge.\n\nForgiveness isn't always a right or obligation. If someone hurts you, you can choose not to forgive. The narrator's stance is about accountability. The brother made a decision and now has to live with the consequences. However, some might argue that holding a grudge for three years is unfair, especially if the brother is trying to make amends now.\n\nBut the narrator's reasoning is that the brother had his chance. The mother cutting them off adds complexity. The narrator might feel betrayed by both the brother and the mother. The stepdad's confirmation that the mother wasn't involved shifts blame to the brother, but at 12, maybe he wasn't mature enough. However, the narrator might see it as a conscious choice.\n\nIn many cases, people expect others to take responsibility and make amends, but the brother didn't do that for three years. The narrator's refusal could be seen as justified because forgiveness isn't automatic. On the other hand, the brother's youth and possible emotional turmoil might mean he wasn't fully responsible.\n\nSo, the balance here is between accountability and forgiveness. The narrator isn't necessarily in the wrong for choosing not to forgive, especially if they feel the brother's actions had real consequences. The brother's delay in reaching out might also play a role. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
