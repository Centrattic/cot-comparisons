When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma\u2019s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn\u2019t want to see me anymore. \n\nI was upset but I gave him space thinking I\u2019d talk to him and explain he doesn\u2019t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it\u2019s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don\u2019t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn\u2019t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn\u2019t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to forgive their younger brother. The situation is that the brother cut off contact after a family argument about donating Grandma's fortune. The author tried to reach out but the brother didn't respond for three years. Now the brother wants to apologize, but the author refuses, saying he had a chance before.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The brother was 12 when he cut off contact. At that age, maybe he was acting impulsively. But the author is 20, an adult, so maybe they expected more maturity from the brother. The argument was between the author and their mom about Grandma's wishes. The brother took sides, which might have been a big deal because family conflicts can be complicated.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the brother made the decision to cut off contact without explanation, so the author isn't obligated to forgive. They also mention that the mother disowned them. The brother is now reaching out after three years, but the author feels it's too late. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, forgiveness is a personal choice. The brother's actions were hurtful, but cutting off an adult sibling for three years might be excessive, especially if there's no clear resolution. On the other hand, the brother was 12, maybe not fully understanding the consequences. The author might feel wronged, so refusing forgiveness isn't necessarily wrong. However, some might argue that holding a grudge for three years is harsh, especially since the brother is now trying to reconcile. \n\nThe key points are the brother's age at the time, the author's maturity, and whether the brother's actions were justified. Since the brother had no prior issues and just cut off without explanation, the author's stance might be seen as justified. But others might say that forgiveness is important in family relationships. The answer depends on societal views on forgiveness and family dynamics. Given the options, the answer is either A or B. Since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, and given the context, the author's decision to not forgive could be seen as not wrong because they're not obligated to forgive. So the answer is B.\n"
