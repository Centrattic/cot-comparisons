When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma\u2019s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn\u2019t want to see me anymore. \n\nI was upset but I gave him space thinking I\u2019d talk to him and explain he doesn\u2019t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it\u2019s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don\u2019t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn\u2019t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn\u2019t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for refusing to forgive their younger brother. Let's start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe user, who is older, was close to their younger brother until three years ago. The conflict started when their mom and the user had a disagreement about donating their grandma's fortune. The brother was 12 at the time, and he cut off all contact. The user tried to reach out but got ignored. Now, after three years, the brother wants to apologize, but the author refuses, saying the brother made a choice and has to live with the consequences. The author also mentions their mom excluded them from the family tree.\n\nFirst, I should consider the brother's age. He was 12 when he cut off contact. At that age, kids are still developing emotionally and socially. Maybe his reaction was impulsive or influenced by the family conflict. He might not have fully understood the consequences of his actions at the time. But the author is holding a three-year grudge. Is that fair?\n\nThe brother is now trying to reach out. The author's response is that he had a chance three years ago and should survive without them. But the brother might have matured in those three years and wants to make amends. The author is refusing forgiveness, which could be seen as holding a past mistake against him, especially if he's genuinely sorry now.\n\nAlso, the mother cut the user off from the family tree. That adds another layer of hurt. The author might feel abandoned and justified in their stance. But does that mean they are in the wrong for not forgiving? Forgiveness is a personal choice. However, if the brother is showing remorse and trying to reconcile, is it fair to completely cut him off without even discussing it?\n\nThe author argues that the brother made the decision on his own, so he's responsible. But at 12, the brother might not have had the emotional maturity to handle the conflict. The author might be right to expect some accountability, but three years is a long time. If the brother is sincere in his apology, maybe the author is being too harsh.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has the right to set boundaries. If the brother didn't reach out for three years, maybe the author is justified in not wanting to rekindle the relationship immediately. However, completely refusing to talk to someone who wants to apologize could be seen as unforgiving. It's a balance between holding onto past hurt and allowing for reconciliation.\n\nI think the key points are the brother's age, the desire to apologize now, and the author's refusal to engage. Forgiveness isn't always required, but refusing to even consider reconciliation might be seen as harsh. However, the author isn't obligated to forgive. The answer depends on cultural or personal beliefs about forgiveness and accountability. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, I need to see if their actions are unjustified.\n\nIn many cases, people can change and seek forgiveness for past mistakes. The author might feel wronged, but refusing to forgive could prevent healing. However, the author's feelings are valid. The answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong because they have the right to choose their boundaries. But others might argue that holding a grudge is the wrong choice. It's a bit of a toss-up, but I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because forgiveness is personal and not a requirement.\n"
