When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma\u2019s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn\u2019t want to see me anymore. \n\nI was upset but I gave him space thinking I\u2019d talk to him and explain he doesn\u2019t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it\u2019s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don\u2019t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn\u2019t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn\u2019t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for refusing to forgive their younger brother. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nSo, the brother and sister were close until three years ago. The conflict started when their mom had a falling out with the author over how their grandma's money should be handled. The mom wanted to keep most of it, but the grandma wanted it donated. The next week, the brother (who was 12) cut off contact by blocking the author on social media and games. The author tried to reach out, but the brother didn't respond. Now, three years later, the brother wants to apologize and talk, but the author refuses, saying the brother had a chance three years ago and that at 12, his actions had real consequences. The author also mentions the stepdad confirmed the mom wasn't involved in the brother's decision, and their family has cut the author off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ages. The brother was 12 when he cut off contact. At that age, kids might not fully understand the long-term impact of their actions. But the author is now saying that the brother made a choice and should face the consequences. However, the brother is trying to reach out again now, which could show he's matured or realized his mistake. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that the brother had a chance to communicate three years ago but didn't. The author is holding them accountable for a decision made in adolescence. On the other hand, some might argue that the brother was young and may not have had the emotional maturity to handle the situation properly. The author's refusal to forgive could be seen as justified if they feel betrayed and don't see a genuine apology or change in behavior. However, others might think that the brother is trying to make amends now and that the author should consider reconciliation.\n\nThe mother cutting the author off complicates things. It shows family pressure, but the author is maintaining their stance. The key points are the brother's age, the initial conflict's details, and the current attempt at reconciliation. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, some might argue that the brother, being a child, was influenced by family dynamics and may not have fully understood the implications. The author's refusal could stem from feeling hurt and not wanting to be in a relationship with someone who could cut them off so abruptly. However, forgiveness is a personal choice, and the author isn't obligated to forgive. \n\nOn the other hand, some might say that holding a grudge for three years is harsh, especially if the brother is trying to make amends. But the author's stance is that the brother had a chance to address it when it happened and didn't, so now they're choosing to let it go on their terms. \n\nI think the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they're prioritizing their emotional well-being and holding the brother accountable for his past actions. However, it's a gray area, and different people might have different opinions. The answer might lean towards B (No) because the author is choosing to protect themselves and not forcing forgiveness, which is their right.\n"
