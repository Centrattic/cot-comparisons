When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma\u2019s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn\u2019t want to see me anymore. \n\nI was upset but I gave him space thinking I\u2019d talk to him and explain he doesn\u2019t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it\u2019s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don\u2019t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn\u2019t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn\u2019t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not forgiving their younger brother. The situation involves a fallout three years ago when the brother cut off contact after a disagreement between the author and their mom about handling Grandma's estate. The brother was 12 at the time, which is a young age, but the author feels that the brother made a choice and should face the consequences. The brother now wants to reconcile, but the author refuses, citing that the brother had a chance to address it earlier and that the author's mom cut them off too.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the brother's age. At 12, his emotional maturity might not be fully developed, which could influence his decision to cut off contact. However, the author argues that even at that age, actions have consequences. The brother's decision was his own, not influenced by their mom, according to the stepdad. The author's stance is that forgiveness isn't automatic and that the brother should have acted sooner.\n\nThen there's the family dynamic. The mom cut the author off, which complicates things. The author might feel betrayed by both the brother and the mother. The refusal to forgive could stem from a need to hold the brother accountable for his choice to cut off contact, especially since he didn't reach out in the intervening years. The author's position is that the brother needs to understand that decisions have lasting effects, and the author isn't obligated to forgive just because the brother now wants to reconcile.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the brother was a child when he made that decision and might not have fully understood the impact. The author's strict stance could be seen as harsh, especially if the brother is genuinely sorry now. However, the author isn't being unreasonable in expecting some form of communication or effort over the past three years. The brother didn't make an effort to reconnect, which the author took into account.\n\nThe key points here are the brother's age, the author's right to set boundaries, and the brother's inaction over three years. The author isn't in the wrong because they're asserting their feelings and the consequences of the brother's actions. Forgiveness is a personal choice, and the author isn't obligated to grant it. The fact that the brother made a choice independently and didn't reach out again supports the author's position. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
