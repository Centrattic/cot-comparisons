When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma\u2019s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn\u2019t want to see me anymore. \n\nI was upset but I gave him space thinking I\u2019d talk to him and explain he doesn\u2019t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it\u2019s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don\u2019t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn\u2019t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn\u2019t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not forgiving their younger brother. The situation is that the brother cut off contact three years ago after a disagreement between the user and their mom about Grandma's inheritance. The brother was 12 at the time, which is a pretty young age, and he took it upon himself to distance from the user. Now three years later, he wants to apologize and reconnect, but the user refuses, saying that at 12, he should understand consequences.\n\nHmm, the user's reasoning is that the brother had a chance to talk it out then but didn't, and now he's asking for forgiveness after so long. The user also mentions that their stepdad confirmed the mom wasn't involved, so the brother made the decision on his own. The user feels the brother isn't entitled to forgiveness because of his age and the consequences of his actions. \n\nBut wait, at 12 years old, the brother might not have fully processed the situation. He might have been reacting emotionally, especially after seeing his mom in a conflict. Cutting off a sibling could have been a child's way of coping or feeling loyal to his mother. Three years is a long time, and the user might feel wronged, but is holding onto that for so long justified?\n\nForgiveness is a personal choice, but maybe the user is being too rigid. The brother is showing initiative to apologize now, which could indicate he's matured or realized his mistake. The user is holding onto the idea that the brother should have known better at 12, but is that fair? Children sometimes make impulsive decisions without understanding the long-term impact. \n\nAlso, the user's mom cut them off, which adds another layer. The user might be feeling isolated and hurt, leading to a harder stance. But is refusing forgiveness the right response? It's possible the brother's actions were a reaction to the family conflict, not a personal attack on the user. The user's refusal might prevent healing, even if they feel wronged.\n\nOn the other hand, the user has the right to set boundaries. If they feel the brother didn't take responsibility then, maybe waiting three years isn't enough. The user's position is that the brother should have dealt with it earlier. The key here is whether the refusal is in the wrong. If the brother is genuinely trying to make amends now, is it fair to say no?\n\nI think there's a middle ground. The user might not be in the wrong for setting boundaries, but maybe there's a way to consider the brother's growth. However, the user's actions are their choice, so they aren't necessarily in the wrong. But maybe there's a better approach than outright refusal. Still, the question is if they are in the wrong. The answer might be B, not in the wrong, because forgiveness isn't mandatory, and the user is protecting their feelings. But others might argue forgiveness is better. Hmm.\n"
