When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma\u2019s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn\u2019t want to see me anymore. \n\nI was upset but I gave him space thinking I\u2019d talk to him and explain he doesn\u2019t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it\u2019s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don\u2019t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn\u2019t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn\u2019t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation is about a sibling conflict where the author refused to forgive their younger brother after he cut off contact three years ago.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The brother and the author were close until three years ago. The issue started when their mom had a falling out with the author over how to handle their grandma's inheritance. The brother, who was 12 at the time, decided to cut off contact with the author by removing them from social media and games. The author tried to reach out, but the brother didn't respond. Now, after three years, the brother wants to apologize, but the author refuses, saying that at 12, he should understand the consequences of his actions and that he can survive without contact.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the brother made the decision on his own (confirmed by the stepdad that the mom wasn't involved), so the brother is responsible. The author feels he's not entitled to forgiveness. The mom has also cut the author off, trimming their branch from the family tree.\n\nThe user thinks the author might be in the wrong but wants my opinion. The question is whether the author is at fault here.\n\nLet me break down the key points. The brother was 12 when he cut off contact. At that age, emotional maturity is still developing. Even though the brother did make the decision, maybe the author is being too harsh in refusing forgiveness after three years. On the other hand, the brother did take a side against the author without understanding the full context, and the author tried to reach out but was ignored for three years. The author might feel hurt and justified in holding a grudge, especially if the brother never explained his actions or apologized until now.\n\nBut considering the brother's age, maybe the author is overreacting. At 12, the brother's judgment might not have been fully formed, and he could have been influenced by the mom's arguments during the conflict. The author is now 23 (since it's three years later and they were 20 when the incident happened). The brother is 15 now. The author is an adult, and while the brother made a choice, the author's refusal to forgive might be seen as cutting off a family member without giving a chance for reconciliation, which is a natural human need.\n\nHowever, the author's stance is that they tried to reach out, and the brother didn't respond. The author might be protecting themselves from further hurt, especially after the family cutting them off. It's a delicate balance between accountability and forgiveness. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong for not forgiving. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at intent, proportionality of the response, and whether there's a chance for reconciliation. Here, the author's response could be seen as justified if they believe the brother was wrong and that the brother had the chance to reconcile earlier. But the author is also choosing to end the relationship, which is a significant decision. The brother is now making amends, but the author is refusing, which might be seen as harsh if the brother is sincere now.\n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't obligated to forgive. Forgiveness is a personal choice, and they might feel that the brother's actions were a real choice with real consequences. The author's reasoning is that the brother should have known better at 12, which is a bit of a mature expectation but maybe not unreasonable if the brother was aware of the situation. However, the author is an adult now, and the brother is still a teenager, so maybe the author should consider the brother's age and inexperience when making the decision to cut off contact.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the answer is based on whether their response is reasonable, then maybe not. They tried to reach out, the brother didn't respond for three years, and the author is now choosing to let go. However, if the author is being overly harsh and not allowing for the brother's growth or the chance to mend the relationship, then maybe the author is at fault. \n\nBut the key point is that the brother took a side against the author without explanation and cut off contact. The author tried to explain but was ignored. The author's reaction is a form of self-protection. In terms of being in the wrong, it's more about whether the author's refusal to forgive is unjustified. Given the brother's initial refusal to communicate and the author's attempts to reach out, the author might be justified. However, the refusal to even consider the brother's current apology could be seen as unkind, especially if the brother is genuinely remorseful now.\n\nIn AITA threads, the community often values forgiveness and reconciliation unless there's ongoing harm or abuse. If this was a one-time decision by a minor, the author might be seen as the asshole for cutting off the brother. But if the author feels that the brother's actions were a choice and that the author isn't obligated to forgive, then maybe not. It's a tough call. I think the answer hinges on whether the author's response is proportionally justified. Since the brother is now reaching out and the author is choosing not to engage, even though the brother's initial action was at a young age, the author might be seen as the asshole for not allowing the relationship to be mended. So maybe the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe B (No), because the author isn't required to forgive. It's a bit of a toss-up. I'll go with A because the author is cutting off a family member without considering the brother's current remorse and the brother's age at the time, which might be a mitigating factor.\n"
