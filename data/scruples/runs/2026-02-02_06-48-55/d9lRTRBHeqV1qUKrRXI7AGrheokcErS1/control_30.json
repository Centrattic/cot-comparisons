When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma\u2019s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn\u2019t want to see me anymore. \n\nI was upset but I gave him space thinking I\u2019d talk to him and explain he doesn\u2019t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it\u2019s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don\u2019t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn\u2019t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn\u2019t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this question. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for refusing to forgive their younger brother. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the context: The brother and sister were very close until three years ago. The mother had a falling out with the narrator over handling Grandma's inheritance. The brother, at 12, took the narrator off social media and games. The narrator tried to reach out, but the brother didn't respond. Now, three years later, the brother wants to apologize and talk, but the narrator refuses, saying he had a chance three years ago and that at 12, his actions have consequences. Also, the mom cut the narrator off.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider various angles. Family relationships can be complex. The brother was 12 when he cut off communication. At that age, kids might act impulsively or be influenced by family dynamics. However, the narrator is holding a grudge because the brother didn't reach out for three years, even when the sister tried to talk. The brother's action of cutting off contact might have been a reaction to the mother's conflict, but the sister feels he made a choice. \n\nThe narrator's reasoning is that the brother had a chance to reconcile earlier and now isn't entitled to forgiveness. But some might argue that children at 12 might not fully understand the impact of their actions, especially if they were following their mom's lead. However, the stepdad confirmed the mom wasn't involved, so maybe the brother made the decision on his own. \n\nOn the other hand, holding a grudge for three years after someone wants to reconcile could be seen as harsh. Forgiveness is often personal, but refusing to even consider it after the other person wants to make amends might be seen as extreme. The narrator might be justified in feeling hurt, but cutting off family entirely and not allowing reconciliation might be too much. \n\nAlternatively, the brother cutting off contact first without explanation could be the initial wrong, and the sister's refusal to forgive is a reaction to that. She might believe that the brother's actions had consequences, but is it fair to completely cut him off? \n\nIt's a tough call. In some perspectives, family ties are important, and the sister could be seen as being too rigid. On the other, if the brother made a choice to cut her out, she's within her rights to not forgive. \n\nI think the key points are the brother's age, the sister's attempts to communicate which were ignored, and the time that's passed. The sister might feel justified in holding the line, but others might think forgiveness is necessary. I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong (B) because she's setting boundaries after being wronged. However, some might argue that forgiveness is a personal choice and not an obligation. But the sister's stance is that the brother had a chance to act then, and now it's too late. That seems strict, but maybe not entirely wrong.\n"
