When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma\u2019s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn\u2019t want to see me anymore. \n\nI was upset but I gave him space thinking I\u2019d talk to him and explain he doesn\u2019t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it\u2019s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don\u2019t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn\u2019t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn\u2019t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for refusing to forgive their younger brother.\n\nFirst, the backstory: The author and their brother were close until three years ago. The conflict started when the author's mom and the author had a disagreement about honoring Grandma's wishes regarding her fortune. The mom wanted to keep most of it, but the Grandma wanted it donated. The brother, who was 12 at the time, took the author off his social media and games. The author tried to reach out, but the brother didn't respond. Now, three years later, the brother wants to apologize and talk, but the author refuses, saying the brother had a chance three years ago and that his actions at 12 had real consequences. The author's mom cut them off from the family tree.\n\nThe author is asking if they're in the wrong. The user thinks they might be, but wants my opinion. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nHmm. Let me break this down. The brother was 12 when he cut off the author. At that age, some might argue that he wasn't fully aware of the consequences or was acting on emotions, maybe influenced by his mother's argument. However, the author's position is that even at 12, the brother made a choice that led to long-term separation. The author is holding the brother accountable for that decision, not wanting to forgive, and the stepdad confirmed the mother wasn't involved, so the brother acted on his own.\n\nOn one hand, the brother took the initiative to apologize now. The author might feel that the brother didn't take responsibility back then, so why now? The author's reasoning is that he's showing the brother that the consequences of his actions were real, and the brother had to live with the separation. The author might believe that forgiveness should be earned, not given just because someone apologizes years later without prior communication.\n\nOn the other hand, could the author be overreacting? At 12, some people might not have the maturity to handle such a situation, and maybe the brother's actions were impulsive. The author is being strict, but is that fair? Also, the mother cutting the author off complicates things. The author might feel hurt and wronged, and not wanting to forgive could be a protective measure after being excluded from the family.\n\nBut the question is if the author is in the wrong. The brother did wrong by cutting off communication without explanation, especially after the author tried to reach out. The author's response of refusing forgiveness might be seen as justified if they feel their brother acted willfully and without remorse at the time. However, some might argue that holding a grudge for three years is excessive, especially since the brother is now trying to make amends.\n\nAnother angle: The author's stance is that the brother should have taken responsibility earlier. The brother didn't communicate, so the author's refusal to engage now is a lesson. But maybe the brother's reasons now are valid, and the author is being too rigid. However, the author mentions that they didn't receive any explanation before, so they have no information to work with now. The brother's initial action was a choice, and the author is making him face the consequences.\n\nI think the key points are the brother's age and intent. At 12, was it a mature decision? If the brother was acting out of anger from his mom's argument, maybe he didn't realize the impact. But the author is holding him accountable regardless. The author's position is that the brother had a chance to explain then but didn't, so now there's no second chance. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, if the brother's action was a mistake due to youth and immaturity, then the author might be too harsh. But if the brother made a conscious choice to cut ties without valid reason, then the author's refusal could be justified. The author's mom cutting them off also adds emotional weight. The author might feel betrayed by both the brother and the mother, making forgiveness harder.\n\nBut the question is about the author's current action. The author is refusing forgiveness, which could be seen as right if the brother's actions were willful and without prior communication. However, some might say that not giving the brother a chance to explain now is unfair. But the author didn't get an explanation before, and the brother didn't reach out for three years. The author's decision to say \"no more\" might be a way to protect themselves after being hurt. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author is not in the wrong. They're standing by their decision to hold the brother accountable, and their reasoning is based on the brother's past actions. The brother's attempt now might be sincere, but the author has valid reasons to refuse forgiveness, especially since the brother didn't take responsibility earlier. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
