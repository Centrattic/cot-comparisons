When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma\u2019s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn\u2019t want to see me anymore. \n\nI was upset but I gave him space thinking I\u2019d talk to him and explain he doesn\u2019t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it\u2019s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don\u2019t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn\u2019t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn\u2019t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to forgive their younger brother. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, there was a conflict between the author and their mother over honoring Grandma's wishes regarding her fortune. The mother wanted to keep most of it, whereas the author believed in donating as per Grandma's wishes. Then, after this argument, the brother (who was 12 at the time) cut off contact with the author. The brother didn't respond to messages, and the author gave him space, hoping to reconcile. Now, three years later, the brother wants to apologize and talk, but the author refuses, saying he had his chance and that actions at 12 have real consequences. The author also mentions the stepdad confirmed the brother made the decision on his own, and the mom cut off the author from the family tree.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the brother's actions of cutting off contact when he was 12, the author's refusal to forgive after three years, and the fact that the brother is now seeking reconciliation. The author feels the brother isn't entitled to forgiveness because he didn't give a reason at the time and made a firm decision to cut ties. The author is also in a situation where the family has ostracized them.\n\nI need to consider whether the author is justified in their stance. On one hand, the brother was 12, which is a young age, but some would argue that at 12, a child can make decisions that impact relationships. However, others might say that children at that age don't fully understand the consequences. The brother's actions were sudden and without explanation, leading to a long estrangement.\n\nThe author's response is to refuse forgiveness, emphasizing that the brother had a chance to act differently three years ago. The author might be holding onto the hurt from both the brother's actions and the mother's subsequent cutting them off. The author's position is that the brother should take responsibility for his choice, even if it's harsh. \n\nBut is the author wrong? Well, forgiveness is a personal choice, and it's not necessarily a moral failing to not forgive. However, some might argue that the brother, now seeking to reconcile, deserves a chance to explain himself. The author is using the brother's age as a point, suggesting that even at 12, his actions had lasting effects. But does that mean the author is justified in refusing reconciliation? \n\nAlso, the brother's initial decision to cut off contact without explanation might have been impulsive or influenced by family dynamics. However, the author isn't giving him the opportunity to explain now, which could be seen as unfair, especially if the brother has grown and wants to make amends. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author believes that the brother was fully aware of the consequences and made a deliberate choice to cut ties, then the author's stance is about accountability. The author might feel that forgiveness would undermine their own values or the importance of honoring commitments. \n\nIn terms of societal expectations, some might say that holding a grudge for three years is harsh, especially if the brother is trying to reach out. Others might support the author's decision to prioritize their own well-being and not force forgiveness. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's refusal is unreasonable. Since the brother did cut off contact without explanation and the author has valid reasons for holding onto that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, the decision to refuse forgiveness is complex. But according to the question, the options are A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong). Given the context, the author's reasoning is based on the brother's past actions and the age at which those actions occurred. The author isn't refusing forgiveness without cause. So I would lean towards B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
