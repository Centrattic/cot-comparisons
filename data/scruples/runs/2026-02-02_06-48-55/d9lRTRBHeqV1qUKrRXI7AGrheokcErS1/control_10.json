When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma\u2019s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn\u2019t want to see me anymore. \n\nI was upset but I gave him space thinking I\u2019d talk to him and explain he doesn\u2019t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it\u2019s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don\u2019t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn\u2019t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn\u2019t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author is asking if they're at fault for refusing to forgive their younger brother. The backstory is that three years ago, there was a big argument between their mom and the author about donating Grandma's fortune to charities instead of keeping it. The brother, who was 12 at the time, took the author off social media and games, then cut off all contact. The author tried to reach out, but the brother didn't respond. Now, three years later, the brother wants to apologize and talk, but the author refuses, saying the brother had a chance to talk before and the age was too young to make that decision. The mom also cut the author off the family tree.\n\nHmm. First, I should consider the brother's age. At 12, he's a kid, right? His actions might have been influenced by his mom's argument, maybe he felt pressured or confused. But the author is pointing out that even at 12, actions have consequences. However, is it fair to hold something from when someone was a child for three years? Maybe the brother matured since then and is trying to make amends.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the brother didn't take responsibility back then and now is asking for forgiveness after a long time. The author feels that since the brother chose to cut off contact then, it's not their fault to be upset now. But is there a difference between holding a grudge and standing by one's decision? Also, the fact that the brother is trying to reach out now shows initiative, but maybe the author feels it's too late.\n\nAnother angle: the mother's role. She caused the initial conflict by not honoring Grandma's wishes. The brother might have been reacting to that, perhaps thinking his mom was right. The author's mom cutting them off adds another layer of family conflict. The father (stepdad) confirmed the brother acted on his own, which might support the author's stance that the brother made his own choice.\n\nBut is the author being too harsh? Forgiveness can be a personal choice. If the author feels that the brother had the chance to explain and chose not to, then refusing to forgive might be justified. However, some might argue that the brother was just a child and didn't handle the situation well, so expecting forgiveness now isn't reasonable. Also, holding a grudge for three years could be seen as extreme, but maybe the author's feelings are valid given the family estrangement.\n\nI think it's a judgment call. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong if they feel the brother wasn't responsible for reaching out earlier. The brother made a choice when he was younger, and the author is holding him accountable. On the other hand, some might say the brother is trying to make things right now, and the author could be too rigid. But given the information, the author's perspective has merit. So maybe the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
