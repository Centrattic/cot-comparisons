When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma\u2019s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn\u2019t want to see me anymore. \n\nI was upset but I gave him space thinking I\u2019d talk to him and explain he doesn\u2019t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it\u2019s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don\u2019t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn\u2019t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn\u2019t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not forgiving their younger brother after he cut off contact three years ago. The brother was 12 at the time and took the author off social media and games after a family argument. The author tried to reach out but got no response. Now the brother wants to apologize, but the author refuses, saying the brother had a chance to talk before and now should survive without them.\n\nHmm, the key points here are the age of the brother when he acted, the context of the family argument, and the author's decision to hold a grudge for three years. At 12, the brother might not have fully understood the consequences of his actions. The author might be holding onto the hurt from being cut off without explanation, especially after the mother's involvement in the initial conflict. \n\nBut the author is now refusing to forgive despite the brother's attempt to make amends. Forgiveness is a personal choice, but some might argue that holding a grudge for three years over a 12-year-old's actions is overreacting. Others might say the brother's initial action was immature, and the author is justified in seeking accountability. \n\nThe stepdad confirmed the brother acted on his own, so the mother wasn't involved. The author's mom cut them off, adding to the family tension. The author's reasoning is that someone 12 years old can have real consequences, but maybe that's using the brother's age against him. Also, the brother is trying to apologize now, which could be a genuine effort to repair the relationship. \n\nI think the author's stance is strict, but whether they're in the wrong depends on perspectives. If the brother genuinely wants to reconcile and the author is unwilling to listen now, maybe the author is being too rigid. Forgiveness doesn't always mean forgetting, but refusing to even consider the brother's apology might show a lack of empathy. However, the author might feel betrayed and need time to process. It's a complex situation where both sides have valid points.\n"
