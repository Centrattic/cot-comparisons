When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma\u2019s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn\u2019t want to see me anymore. \n\nI was upset but I gave him space thinking I\u2019d talk to him and explain he doesn\u2019t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it\u2019s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don\u2019t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn\u2019t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn\u2019t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for refusing to forgive their younger brother. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the backstory: The author and their brother were close until three years ago. The conflict started when the author's mom had a falling out with the author over Grandma's fortune. The brother, at age 12, took the author off social media and gaming platforms. The author tried to reach out, but the brother didn't respond. Now, three years later, the brother wants to apologize, but the author refuses, saying the brother had a chance to act when he was 12 and should face consequences. The author also mentions their mom cut them off the family tree.\n\nThe user thinks the author might be in the wrong. I need to consider both sides. From the author's perspective, the brother made a choice at 12 to cut ties, and after three years of no contact, the brother wants to reconnect now. The author feels the brother isn't entitled to forgiveness because he didn't take responsibility earlier. The author also points out that the stepdad confirmed the mother wasn't involved, so the brother acted on his own.\n\nOn the other hand, the brother was only 12 when he cut ties. At that age, kids might not fully understand the consequences of their actions. Emotional decision-making at that age can be impulsive. The brother is now trying to apologize, showing maybe he's matured. The author's refusal might be seen as holding a grudge over something from years ago. However, the author has a right to set boundaries, especially if they felt betrayed. The fact that the family cut them off adds another layer of hurt.\n\nForgiveness is personal. The author is choosing not to forgive, which is their right. But is that \"wrong\"? It depends on societal expectations of forgiveness versus personal boundaries. If the brother was trying to make amends, refusing might seem harsh. But if the author feels wronged and the brother didn't take responsibility until now, the author's stance could be justified. The key points are the brother's age, the sudden cutoff, and the lack of communication for three years. The author's decision to not forgive could be seen as a boundary to protect their emotional well-being. However, some might argue that holding a grudge for three years is extreme. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author is being unreasonable. Since the brother was young and the author is setting a boundary, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But if the brother's actions were malicious, then the author's refusal is justified. The stepdad confirmed the mother wasn't involved, so the brother did act alone. The author's reasoning about consequences at age 12 is valid. So, perhaps the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
