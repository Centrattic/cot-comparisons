When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma\u2019s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn\u2019t want to see me anymore. \n\nI was upset but I gave him space thinking I\u2019d talk to him and explain he doesn\u2019t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it\u2019s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don\u2019t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn\u2019t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn\u2019t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation involves a brother cutting off the author after a family conflict, and the author refusing to forgive after three years when the brother wants to reconcile.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The brother was 12 when he cut off the author. The conflict started because of a disagreement over their grandmother's estate. The author tried to reach out but didn't get a response. Now the brother wants to apologize, but the author is refusing, emphasizing the brother's age and the consequences of his actions.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI should consider factors like intentionality, maturity, and the passage of time. The brother was 12, which is a young age where understanding consequences might not be as developed. However, the author is now being asked to forgive after three years of no contact. The author's stance is that the brother had a chance to address it earlier and that the author has been cut off from the family as well.\n\nSome arguments for the author not being in the wrong: the brother made a decision on his own, didn't communicate for three years, and the author's position is about accountability. The author's mom also cut them off, contributing to their feelings of isolation.\n\nOn the other hand, the brother is now trying to reconcile, and the author's refusal might be seen as harsh, especially considering the age and immaturity at the time. But the author has valid reasons based on the brother's past actions and lack of communication.\n\nIn terms of ethics, forgiveness is a personal choice. The author isn't obligated to forgive, especially if they feel the brother didn't take responsibility earlier. The brother's initial decision was unilateral, and the author's response is about setting boundaries. The author's decision isn't necessarily wrong because they're prioritizing their own emotional well-being and the brother's accountability.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
