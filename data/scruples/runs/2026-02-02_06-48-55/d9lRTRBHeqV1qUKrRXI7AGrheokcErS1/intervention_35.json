When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma\u2019s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn\u2019t want to see me anymore. \n\nI was upset but I gave him space thinking I\u2019d talk to him and explain he doesn\u2019t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it\u2019s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don\u2019t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn\u2019t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn\u2019t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to forgive their younger brother. The situation involves a fallout between the author and their brother after an argument about their grandmother's fortune. The brother cut off contact at age 12, and now three years later, he wants to apologize, but the author refuses to forgive.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The initial conflict was between the author and their mom over donating the grandmother's money. The brother, at 12, took sides by cutting off contact with the author. The author tried to reach out but didn't get a response. Now the brother is trying to reconnect, but the author is holding a grudge, saying he should have known that at 12, his actions have consequences and that he had a chance to make amends before. The author's mom also cut them off from the family tree, which adds to the emotional weight.\n\nThe user thinks the author might be in the wrong, so they want to discuss both sides. On one hand, the brother was young and impulsive, maybe not fully understanding the long-term effects of his actions. At 12, emotional maturity isn't there yet, so cutting off contact might have been a knee-jerk reaction. The author's point about real consequences is valid because the brother made a decision to end the relationship without considering the future. However, the brother is now trying to apologize, which shows some level of maturity and reflection.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is justified in feeling hurt and seeing the need for accountability. If the brother took sides without understanding the situation, it's reasonable for the author to expect some form of explanation or apology at the time. The fact that the brother didn't respond to messages for three years could be seen as intentional, but at 12, maybe he wasn't in a place to communicate. The author's stance is that forgiveness isn't automatic and requires the other person to take responsibility. \n\nBut the question is whether refusing to forgive is the wrong. Forgiveness is a personal choice, and the author isn't obligated to forgive. However, completely cutting off a sibling might be harsh, especially if the brother is now showing remorse. The author's reasoning is that the brother had a chance three years ago, but that was when he was 12. Now, he's older (15) and might have a better understanding. The author's refusal could be seen as holding onto past actions without considering the brother's growth. \n\nThe stepdad confirmed the mom wasn't involved, so the brother's action was his own. The author might feel betrayed. However, the brother's lack of response could be due to his age and emotional state at the time. The author's decision to not forgive might be about maintaining boundaries and teaching the brother about consequences, which is a valid approach. But is it wrong? It's a tough call. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, family relationships are important, and forgiveness is often encouraged. But the author has a right to their feelings. The key is whether the author's refusal is unjustified. The brother's actions were a choice, but his age and possible immaturity play a role. The author's stance on consequences and boundaries is firm. However, the brother's attempt to reach out now might be a genuine effort to repair the relationship, which the author is ignoring. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the brother is now trying to reconcile, the author might be missing an opportunity for healing. But if the author believes the brother didn't take responsibility then, maybe their current position is understandable. The answer depends on whether the author's refusal to forgive is seen as holding a grudge or standing up for their own feelings. Since the brother was young, maybe the author isn't in the wrong for being firm, but some might argue that being open to reconciliation is better. I think the answer leans towards B, the author is not in the wrong, because they're prioritizing their own needs and the brother's initial choice to cut off contact without explanation. However, the author could consider if the brother's current apology is sincere and if there's a way to rebuild trust.\n"
