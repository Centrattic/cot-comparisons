When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma\u2019s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn\u2019t want to see me anymore. \n\nI was upset but I gave him space thinking I\u2019d talk to him and explain he doesn\u2019t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it\u2019s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don\u2019t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn\u2019t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn\u2019t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a brother cutting off contact after a family argument about a grandmother's inheritance.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author's younger brother was 12 when he blocked them on social media and didn't respond to messages. The reason was a disagreement between the author's mom and the author over the grandmother's money. The brother chose to cut ties, not take sides, and the author is now refusing to forgive him after three years. The brother wants to apologize, but the author says he missed his chance because at 12, his actions had real consequences. The author's mom also cut them off.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The brother was 12, which is a young age, but maybe old enough to understand the situation. The author tried to reach out but the brother didn't respond. Now the brother wants to reconnect after three years. The author's stance is that the brother made a choice and should face the consequences. \n\nOn one hand, cutting off a sibling is a big deal. The brother might have been acting out of fear or pressure, especially since the mother might have influenced him. But the author's mother cut them off as well. The brother's actions were intentional, even if he was young. The author is holding them accountable, saying that the brother should have reached out before. The author might feel hurt and betrayed, seeing the brother's decision as a choice to side against them, even if the brother claimed he wasn't choosing sides. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, forgiveness isn't always obligatory. The author has the right to feel that the brother's actions had consequences and that it's not their responsibility to make amends after three years of silence. However, there's also the aspect of family and reconciliation. The brother is trying to reach out now, and the author's refusal might be seen as harsh, but maybe justified if the brother didn't communicate for so long. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that at 12, the brother made a decision that affects him now. The author isn't obligated to forgive, especially if they feel the brother didn't seek reconciliation when the situation was fresh. The mother's role is also a factor, but the brother made his own choice. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong. They have the right to set boundaries and expect accountability. The brother's actions were his choice, and the author is justified in their response. The answer would be B.\n"
