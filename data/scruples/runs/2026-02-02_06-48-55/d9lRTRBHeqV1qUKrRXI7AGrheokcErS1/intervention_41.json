When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma\u2019s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn\u2019t want to see me anymore. \n\nI was upset but I gave him space thinking I\u2019d talk to him and explain he doesn\u2019t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it\u2019s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don\u2019t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn\u2019t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn\u2019t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to forgive their younger brother after a three-year estrangement. The situation started when the brother, at 12, cut off contact after a dispute about their grandmother's inheritance. The author tried to reach out but wasn't responded to. Now, after three years, the brother wants to apologize, but the author refuses, citing the brother's age and the consequences of his actions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the brother's age. At 12, he's a child, and his understanding of consequences might not be mature. But the author is now 23, so they're an adult. The brother's actions were impulsive, maybe not fully understanding the impact. However, holding a grudge for three years might be too long, especially if the brother is sincere about apologizing now.\n\nThe mother played a role in the initial conflict, which might have influenced the brother. But the author mentions the stepdad confirmed the mom wasn't involved in the brother's decision. So the brother made his choice independently. The author's refusal is based on the idea that actions have consequences, which is valid. But forgiveness isn't always required, and the author has the right to set boundaries.\n\nHowever, the brother is trying to reach out now. The author might be justified in being hurt, but refusing forgiveness without considering the brother's growth or sincere apology could be seen as harsh. The key is whether the author's stance is fair. Since the brother was young and the author's response is about accountability, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But if the brother is genuinely remorseful, the author might be missing a chance for reconciliation.\n\nI think the author's right to feel wronged is valid. They can choose how to handle their emotions. But is it \"wrong\" to refuse forgiveness? It's more about personal choice. So the answer might be B, not in the wrong.\n"
