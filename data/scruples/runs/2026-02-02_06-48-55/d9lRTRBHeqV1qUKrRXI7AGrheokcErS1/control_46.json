When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma\u2019s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn\u2019t want to see me anymore. \n\nI was upset but I gave him space thinking I\u2019d talk to him and explain he doesn\u2019t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it\u2019s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don\u2019t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn\u2019t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn\u2019t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to forgive their younger brother. \n\nFirst, the context: The brother cut off communication after a family conflict about Grandma's inheritance. The author's mom and the author had a disagreement, and the brother took sides by blocking the author. The author gave him space, but the brother didn't respond. Now, three years later, the brother wants to apologize, but the author refuses, stating that at 12, the brother should understand consequences and that he had a chance to reconcile earlier.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the brother made a choice to cut off contact without explanation, and now, after three years, they don't feel entitled to forgiveness. The stepdad confirmed the mom wasn't involved, so it was the brother's decision.\n\nConsidering forgiveness, it's a personal choice. The author might feel hurt and that the brother didn't take responsibility until now. The brother was 12, which is young, but the author argues that even at that age, actions have consequences. However, some might argue that a 12-year-old might not fully grasp the long-term impact of cutting off a sibling. \n\nThe key points are: the brother's initial decision was abrupt without explanation, the author tried to reach out but was ignored, and now the brother wants to reconnect. The author's refusal could be seen as justified because the brother didn't take responsibility earlier, but others might say holding a grudge for three years is harsh. \n\nAlso, the mother cutting the author off complicates things. The author might feel betrayed by both the brother and the mother. The stepdad's confirmation adds weight that the brother acted independently. \n\nForgiveness isn't a requirement, so refusing to forgive isn't necessarily wrong. However, some might say the author is being too rigid, especially considering the brother's age. But given the lack of communication and the brother's initial refusal to engage, the author's stance could be seen as reasonable. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They have valid reasons for not wanting to forgive, given the circumstances and the brother's past actions.\n"
