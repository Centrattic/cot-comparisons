When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma\u2019s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn\u2019t want to see me anymore. \n\nI was upset but I gave him space thinking I\u2019d talk to him and explain he doesn\u2019t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it\u2019s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don\u2019t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn\u2019t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn\u2019t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for refusing to forgive their younger brother. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the background: The author and their brother were very close until three years ago. The problem started when the author was 20 and their brother was 12. There was a falling out between the author and their mother about honoring their grandmother's wishes regarding her fortune. The mom wanted to keep most of it, but the grandmother wanted it donated. After that argument, the brother cut off communication by removing the author from social media and games. The author tried to reach out, but the brother didn't respond. Now, three years later, the brother wants to apologize, but the author refused, saying the brother had a chance to talk it out before and didn't take it. The author also points out that at 12, the brother's actions have real consequences. The stepdad confirmed the mom wasn't involved in the brother's decision. The author's mom cut them out of the family.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider a few things here. First, the brother's age at the time of the cutoff\u201412 years old. At that age, some might argue that the child might not fully understand the implications of cutting off a sibling, especially if it was an emotional reaction. However, the brother did take deliberate actions to cut off contact and didn't respond to messages. The author gave space, tried to reach out, but got no response. Now, after three years, the brother wants to reconcile, but the author is holding a grudge. The author's reasoning is that the brother had a chance to address it earlier and didn't, and that the brother's age means his actions had real consequences.\n\nI think the key points here are the brother's age and the timing of the apology. At 12, decision-making and emotional maturity are still developing. The brother might not have realized the impact of his actions. However, the author is pointing out that even a 12-year-old's actions can have consequences, which is valid. The author also mentions that the brother survived three years without them and can survive more. The mother cutting the author off adds to the family tension.\n\nForgiveness is a personal choice, and the author is not obligated to forgive. The brother's actions were cutting off contact without explanation, which can be hurtful. The author's response is to hold onto that hurt and not forgive, which might be seen as justified given the lack of communication. On the other hand, some might argue that holding a grudge for three years is excessive, especially if the brother is trying to make amends now. But the brother didn't make an effort to communicate during those three years. The author's stance is that the brother had a chance to address the issue earlier and didn't, so the author isn't required to forgive now.\n\nI think the author is within their rights to refuse forgiveness. The brother's actions were cutting off contact, not responding, and then after three years wants to apologize. The author's decision is based on the brother's failure to communicate when the issue arose. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
