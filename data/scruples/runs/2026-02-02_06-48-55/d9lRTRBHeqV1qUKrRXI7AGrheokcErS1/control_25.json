When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma\u2019s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn\u2019t want to see me anymore. \n\nI was upset but I gave him space thinking I\u2019d talk to him and explain he doesn\u2019t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it\u2019s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don\u2019t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn\u2019t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn\u2019t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for refusing to forgive their brother. The situation involves a fallout over a family argument about their grandma's estate. The brother cut off contact three years ago, and now wants to reconcile, but the author is refusing forgiveness.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The brother was 12 when he cut off contact, which is a child. The author was 20 and had a falling out with their mom over charitable donations. The brother's action was a reaction to that argument, but he didn't communicate further. Now, after three years, he wants to apologize, but the author is holding a grudge. The author's reasoning is that at 12, the brother's actions had real consequences and that he should have known better. Also, the mother cut the author off from the family.\n\nI should think about whether forgiveness is obligatory. The author is within their rights to not forgive if they feel the brother's actions were wrong. But maybe the brother was acting out of immaturity. The age of 12 is a child, so perhaps the author is being too harsh. However, the author is emphasizing the consequences of his actions. Also, the brother didn't reach out until now. The author's stance is that the brother had a chance to reconcile before but didn't take it, so now it's too late. The stepdad confirmed the brother's decision was his own.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, forgiveness is personal. The author isn't obligated to forgive, especially if they feel it's not appropriate. The brother's actions did cut off contact without explanation, leading to a family split. The author is standing by their decision, which is their right. However, some might argue that holding a grudge for three years is excessive. But given the brother's age and the circumstances, the author's position has merit. The answer likely is B (No), because the author isn't in the wrong for choosing not to forgive.\n"
