I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don\u2019t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn\u2019t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn\u2019t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for refusing to forgive their younger brother. Let's start by breaking down the situation they described.\n\nFirst, the backstory: The user and their brother were very close. Three years ago, when the brother was 12 and the user was 20, there was a conflict between the user's mom and the user about honoring their grandma's wishes regarding her fortune. The mom wanted to keep most of it, but the user thought it should go to charities as per the grandma's request. Then, the brother cut off all contact\u2014Facebook, Snapchat, shared games. The user tried to reach out but got no response. Now, three years later, the brother wants to apologize and talk, but the user refuses, saying the brother had a chance three years ago and that at 12, his actions have consequences. The user also mentions that the stepdad confirmed the mom wasn't involved in the brother's decision. The mom cut the user off from the family tree.\n\nThe user feels they aren't obligated to forgive the brother because he made the decision on his own, and they don't think he deserves forgiveness. They admit they might be overreacting but stand by their decision.\n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? Let's consider a few angles. \n\nFirst, the brother's age: 12 is still a young kid. While the user might think that age is old enough to understand consequences, others might argue that 12-year-olds are still learning about relationships and how to resolve conflicts. The brother's actions\u2014cutting off all contact\u2014could be seen as a reaction to feeling aligned with the mother against the sister. Maybe he felt he had to take sides, even if it was impulsive.\n\nThen, the user's refusal to forgive. Forgiveness is a personal choice, and there's no universal right or wrong here. The user has valid reasons for feeling hurt and wronged. They gave the brother space and tried to communicate, but their messages weren't answered. The brother's initial decision to cut off contact was sudden and without explanation. Now, after three years, he wants to talk, but the user is holding them accountable for that past decision.\n\nOn the other hand, some might say that holding a grudge for three years could be seen as overly harsh, especially since the brother is now seeking reconciliation. The user's stance is that the brother should face the consequences of his actions, which is reasonable. However, refusing to even consider forgiveness might be impacting more than just their relationship with the brother\u2014perhaps the family dynamics and the stepdad's involvement.\n\nThe mom cutting them off the family tree adds another layer. The user is dealing with a family that has chosen to distance themselves, which could make the user feel isolated. Their decision not to forgive could be a way of asserting their own boundaries in response to being cut out.\n\nBut does that make it right? It's complex. The user isn't obligated to forgive, especially if they feel the brother didn't take responsibility at the time. However, the brother is now trying to apologize. The user's response is firm, but maybe there's a middle ground\u2014acknowledging the brother's effort to reach out without necessarily restoring the previous relationship. The user's reasoning is based on the brother's past actions and the age at which he made them. \n\nAnother point: the user is in a position where their mother's actions led to the conflict, and the brother took a side. The user's refusal to forgive might also be a way of standing up against their mother's wishes, even if indirectly. \n\nIn terms of moral judgment, there's no clear right or wrong. The user is within their rights to choose not to forgive. However, some might argue that holding onto the hurt for three years is not healthy, and that the brother's attempt to reconcile should be met with some openness. But given the context\u2014being cut off from the family and the brother's initial decision without explanation\u2014the user's stance is understandable.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the user isn't necessarily in the wrong. They've been hurt, given space, and the brother's actions had lasting consequences. Their choice to hold firm is a personal one, and while it might be seen as harsh by some, it's their right to decide how to handle their emotions and relationships. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
