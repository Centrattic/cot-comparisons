When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma\u2019s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn\u2019t want to see me anymore. \n\nI was upset but I gave him space thinking I\u2019d talk to him and explain he doesn\u2019t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it\u2019s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don\u2019t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn\u2019t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn\u2019t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for refusing to forgive their younger brother. The situation involves a family conflict after a disagreement about their grandmother's inheritance. The brother cut off contact three years ago, and now wants to apologize, but the author refuses to forgive them.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author and their brother were close until the mom had a falling out. The brother, at 12, cut off contact without explanation. The author tried to reach out but didn't get a response. Now, three years later, the brother wants to talk, but the author refuses, citing that the brother had a chance to act then and should face consequences. The author also mentions the mom excluded them from the family tree.\n\nThe user thinks the author might be wrong. I need to evaluate if the author's decision to refuse forgiveness is justified. Factors to consider: the brother's age at the time (12), the sudden cutoff without communication, the author's attempts to reach out, the brother's silence, and the current apology after three years. Also, the mom's role in cutting the author off.\n\nAt 12, children are still developing their understanding of consequences. The brother's actions might have been impulsive, especially given the family conflict. However, the author is emphasizing accountability, which is reasonable. The brother's silence for three years could be seen as avoiding responsibility. The author's refusal to now forgive could be seen as holding a grudge, but they also have reasons to feel hurt and betrayed. The mom's involvement complicates things, as she excluded the author, which might affect the brother's actions.\n\nForgiveness is a personal choice, but the author's stance might be seen as harsh if the brother's actions were due to immaturity rather than malice. However, the author's right to set boundaries is valid. So, is the author in the wrong? It's a balance. If the brother genuinely wants to reconcile and has shown remorse, the author might be unreasonably rejecting a chance for healing. But if the brother didn't take responsibility before, the author's decision could be justified. The answer might hinge on whether the brother's initial actions were willful or just a child's reaction to family tension. Given the context, the author's position could be seen as not entirely wrong, especially since they've had three years of silence. So maybe answer B.\n"
