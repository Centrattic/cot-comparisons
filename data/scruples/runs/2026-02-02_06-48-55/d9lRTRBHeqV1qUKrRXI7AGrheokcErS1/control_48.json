When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma\u2019s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn\u2019t want to see me anymore. \n\nI was upset but I gave him space thinking I\u2019d talk to him and explain he doesn\u2019t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it\u2019s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don\u2019t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn\u2019t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn\u2019t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for refusing to forgive their younger brother. The situation is that when the brother was 12 and the author was 20, their mom had a falling out with the author over handling Grandma's fortune. The brother then cut off contact, and after three years, the brother wants to apologize. The author refuses, saying he had a chance before and now isn't entitled to forgiveness.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The brother was 12, which is a young age. At 12, kids might not fully understand the consequences of their actions, especially cutting off a sibling. However, the author is now 20, so they're both older. The brother's stepdad confirmed that the mom had no part in this, so the brother made the decision on his own. The author's reasoning is that the brother should have explained things at the time and now isn't owed forgiveness because of the past actions.\n\nI should think about whether the author's reaction is justified. The brother cutting off contact without explanation could be seen as impulsive, but after three years, it's been a long time. The author might be holding onto past hurt, which is natural. However, refusing to forgive without any attempt at reconciliation could be problematic. The author's mom also cut them off, which adds another layer of family tension.\n\nBut the key points here are the brother's age and the fact that he's now reaching out. At 12, the brother's actions might have been influenced by the conflict with their mom and not fully thought out. The author is giving him credit for understanding real consequences, but maybe the brother is now mature enough to seek reconciliation. The author's stance is about consequences, but forgiveness can also be a personal choice. The stepdad's confirmation that the mom wasn't involved suggests the brother acted independently, which the author might feel was a betrayal.\n\nOn the other hand, holding a grudge for three years without any contact might be seen as harsh. The brother is trying to make amends now, which is a positive step. The author's refusal might be based on their own feelings of being wronged, but is it fair to deny forgiveness without even hearing the brother's side? The brother never explained why he cut off contact, so the author is left with uncertainty. The author's reasoning is that they gave him space before, but the brother didn't respond. Now, the author is insisting on consequences, possibly due to the importance of the relationship.\n\nI think the answer depends on the brother's responsibility and the right to forgiveness. The author is not wrong for needing time or for setting boundaries, but refusing forgiveness entirely might not be fair. However, the author has the right to their feelings. The stepdad's statement and the brother's initial action without explanation are important. The author might be justified in their refusal if they don't feel the brother took their feelings into account. But maybe forgiveness is a choice, and the author isn't obligated to provide it. So the answer could be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they have a right to decide their own forgiveness, especially given the brother's past actions and lack of communication.\n"
