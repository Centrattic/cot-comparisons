When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma\u2019s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn\u2019t want to see me anymore. \n\nI was upset but I gave him space thinking I\u2019d talk to him and explain he doesn\u2019t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it\u2019s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don\u2019t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn\u2019t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn\u2019t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole?) story is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again to understand the key points.\n\nThe author's younger brother cut ties three years ago after an argument involving their mom and the author's grandmother's inheritance. The author and their mom had a falling out over how the money should be handled. The brother, who was 12 at the time, took the author off social media and games, and didn't respond to messages. Now, three years later, the brother wants to apologize, but the author refuses, saying the brother had a chance to talk earlier and that his actions had real consequences. The author feels they don't owe forgiveness because the brother chose to cut off contact and their mom excluded them from the family.\n\nThe user thinks the author might be in the wrong but wants my opinion. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the brother was 12 years old when he cut off contact. At that age, kids are still developing emotionally and might not fully grasp the consequences of their actions. They might be reacting to family tensions, perhaps influenced by their mother's side of the argument. The author's mom was involved in the original conflict with the author, which might have caused the brother to take sides, even if unintentionally.\n\nThe brother made the decision to cut off contact, according to the stepdad confirming the mom wasn't involved. So it was the brother's choice. But at 12, his judgment isn't fully mature. The author is holding him accountable for a decision made in childhood. The author is now 23, and the brother is 15. The author is refusing to forgive, stating that the brother had a chance three years ago and that he can survive without contact. \n\nThe key here is whether the author is justified in refusing forgiveness. The brother is trying to reconcile now, but the author is choosing not to accept the apology. Forgiveness isn't always required, but the question is about whether the author is in the wrong for not forgiving. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, if the brother's actions were a result of being influenced by family tensions and his own immaturity, maybe the author's stance is too harsh. However, the author has the right to set boundaries. The brother's actions did cause a rift, and the author might feel that the brother didn't take responsibility immediately. However, the brother is now making an effort to apologize. The author's response could be seen as holding a grudge, but they might also feel that the brother didn't own up to his mistakes at the time.\n\nConsidering that the brother was a child, his actions might not be judged the same as an adult. The author is holding him accountable as an adult now, which could be seen as unfair. On the other hand, the author has the right to decide who they want to have in their life. The mother cutting the author off complicates things, but the brother's actions might be part of that family dynamic.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the brother's actions were a result of being a child in a family conflict, the author's refusal to forgive could be seen as overly harsh. However, the author isn't obligated to forgive. But if the brother is genuinely trying to make amends now, refusing without considering his growth might be seen as the author's fault. Alternatively, the author's stance could be justified if they feel the brother didn't take responsibility when it mattered most.\n\nI think it's a bit of a gray area, but leaning towards the author being justified because they have the right to set boundaries. However, if the brother is now making an effort, the author's refusal might be seen as stubborn. But given the brother's age at the time and the family situation, maybe the author is not entirely in the wrong.\n"
