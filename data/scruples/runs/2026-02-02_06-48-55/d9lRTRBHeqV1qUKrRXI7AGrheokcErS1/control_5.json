When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma\u2019s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn\u2019t want to see me anymore. \n\nI was upset but I gave him space thinking I\u2019d talk to him and explain he doesn\u2019t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it\u2019s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don\u2019t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn\u2019t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn\u2019t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a brother cutting off contact after a family argument involving their mom and a grandmother's inheritance. The user is the older sibling, and their younger brother suddenly blocked them on social media and games after a falling out. The user tried to reach out but got no response for three years. Now the brother wants to apologize and reconcile, but the user refuses to forgive, saying the brother had a chance to reach out before and that his actions at age 12 had consequences.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The brother was 12 when he cut off contact. That's a young age, but the user is pointing out that even at 12, actions have consequences. The user might feel that the brother didn't take accountability by not responding for three years. Also, the mother cut the user off the family tree, which adds to the hurt. The user is standing by their decision to not forgive, emphasizing that the brother had his chance.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the brother was a child and might not fully understand the implications of his actions. The user's refusal to forgive could be seen as holding a grudge, especially since the brother is now willing to apologize. The user might also be dealing with betrayal from both the brother and the mother, which complicates things.\n\nBut the user's reasoning is that the brother made the decision independently, and they don't feel he's entitled to forgiveness. The user is prioritizing their own emotional well-being, which is understandable. The fact that the stepdad confirmed the mother had no part in it suggests the brother's action was his own choice, which the user is holding accountable to.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit subjective. The user has a right to set boundaries and decide who stays in their life. Forgiveness is a personal choice, and not forgiving doesn't necessarily make someone wrong. However, some might say that refusing to even consider reconciliation after three years could be seen as harsh, especially if the brother is genuinely remorseful now. But given the context of the brother not responding for three years and the user feeling that the brother chose to let it go, the user's stance seems justified.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
