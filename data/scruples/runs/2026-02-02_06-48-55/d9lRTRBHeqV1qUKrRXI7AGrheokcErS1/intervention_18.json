When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma\u2019s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn\u2019t want to see me anymore. \n\nI was upset but I gave him space thinking I\u2019d talk to him and explain he doesn\u2019t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it\u2019s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don\u2019t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn\u2019t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn\u2019t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a sibling conflict where the author refused to forgive their younger brother for cutting off contact three years ago. Let's break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the background: The author and their brother were close until three years ago when a family argument happened over Grandma's estate. The mom had a conflict with the author about donating the fortune. The brother, at 12, took the author off social media and games, and refused to communicate. The author tried to reach out but got no response. Now, three years later, the brother wants to apologize and talk, but the author refuses, stating that at 12, the brother should understand consequences and that he had a chance to reconcile before.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the brother had a chance three years ago and that the actions had real consequences. The author also mentions the stepdad confirmed the brother made the decision independently, so the mom wasn't involved. The mom, however, cut the author off from the family.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author might be wrong but wants a second opinion. \n\nLet me consider both sides. On one hand, the brother was 12 when he cut off contact. At that age, emotional maturity is developing, but it's still a kid. The brother might not have fully understood the long-term consequences of his actions. The author's stance is that the brother should have taken responsibility earlier, but it's possible the brother was acting out of hurt or confusion, maybe even influenced by the mom's conflict. However, the stepdad confirmed the brother acted alone, so maybe the brother was making his own choice. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is holding a grudge for three years. Forgiveness is often seen as a positive trait, but it's also personal. The author might feel wronged and that the brother didn't take the initiative until now. The author's response is about consequences and accountability. The brother's apology now might be genuine, but the author is choosing not to forgive. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the brother did cut off contact without explanation, but the author also stopped the relationship. The author's refusal to forgive could be seen as holding on to past hurt, which might not be fair. However, the brother's age is a factor\u201412 is still a child, and maybe the author is being too harsh. But the author is emphasizing that actions have consequences, which could be justified. \n\nBut the key point is that the brother is trying to reconcile now. The author is choosing not to forgive because of the past action, but forgiveness isn't always required. However, the author's stance might be contributing to the ongoing family rift. The stepdad and mom's actions also play a role, but the author is focusing on the brother's initial cutoff. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, maybe the author isn't in the wrong, but they could be seen as too rigid. The brother was young, and maybe there were underlying issues. The author's refusal to forgive might be their right, but it's also possible they could consider the brother's growth over three years. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the brother made a choice at 12, and the author is holding them accountable, it's a gray area. But given the brother's age, maybe the author is being too strict. \n\nAlternatively, the author is standing by their decision, which is their prerogative. So maybe the answer is B (author is not in the wrong). Because the author is choosing to hold the brother accountable, and forgiveness isn't mandatory. The brother's actions had real consequences, and the author is asserting their boundaries. The author isn't wrong for choosing not to forgive, especially given the brother's initial decision without explanation. The 12-year-old made a choice, and the author is sticking to their stance. So B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
