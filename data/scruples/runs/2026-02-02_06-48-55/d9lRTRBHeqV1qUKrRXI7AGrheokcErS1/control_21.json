When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma\u2019s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn\u2019t want to see me anymore. \n\nI was upset but I gave him space thinking I\u2019d talk to him and explain he doesn\u2019t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it\u2019s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don\u2019t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn\u2019t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn\u2019t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author refusing to forgive their younger brother after he cut off contact three years ago.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The brother took the author off social media and games after an argument between their mom and the author about donating their grandma's fortune. The brother was 12 at the time, which is a kid, so his actions might be influenced by immaturity. The author tried to reach out but the brother didn't respond. Now the brother wants to apologize after three years, but the author refuses, saying he had a chance to act before and should face consequences.\n\nThe key points here: the brother's age, the sudden cutoff without explanation, the lack of communication from the brother over three years, and the author's refusal to forgive. The author feels justified because the brother didn't take responsibility until now, and they believe the brother should live with the consequences of his actions.\n\nI should consider both sides. On one hand, a 12-year-old might not fully understand the impact of their actions. Cutting off a sibling could have been influenced by peer pressure, family dynamics, or not knowing how to handle the conflict. On the other hand, the author tried to communicate and the brother didn't respond, leading to a long estrangement. The author's stance is that forgiveness isn't automatic and requires the other person to take responsibility earlier.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is wrong. From a moral perspective, forgiveness isn't a given, and people can set boundaries. The brother waited three years to apologize, which might be seen as not taking responsibility promptly. The author's decision to not forgive could be seen as maintaining those boundaries. However, some might argue that the brother was young and the author should be more understanding given his age.\n\nAlso, the mom cutting the author off might have played a role in the brother's actions. The author's position is that they don't owe forgiveness just because the brother is a minor. The answer hinges on whether holding a grudge for three years is reasonable given the brother's age and the lack of prior communication.\n\nI think the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're setting boundaries and expecting accountability. The brother's delay in apologizing and the age factor might support the author's decision. So the answer is B (No).\n"
