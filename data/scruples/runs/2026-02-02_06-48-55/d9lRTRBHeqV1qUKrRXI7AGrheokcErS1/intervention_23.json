When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma\u2019s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn\u2019t want to see me anymore. \n\nI was upset but I gave him space thinking I\u2019d talk to him and explain he doesn\u2019t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it\u2019s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don\u2019t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn\u2019t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn\u2019t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a brother cutting off all communication after a disagreement about their mother's handling of their grandmother's inheritance.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The brother and the author were close until an argument led the brother to block the author on social media and games. The author tried to reach out but got no response. Now, after three years, the brother wants to apologize, but the author refuses to forgive, citing the brother's age and the consequences of his actions.\n\nThe user thinks the author might be wrong but isn't sure. I need to evaluate both sides. On one hand, the brother made a choice to cut off contact at a young age, which the author sees as a real consequence. The author has been holding onto that decision. On the other hand, the brother is now reaching out to apologize, which could be seen as a step towards reconciliation. The author's stance is that the brother had a chance three years ago and now needs to face the consequences of his actions. \n\nBut wait, the brother was 12 when he cut off contact. At that age, a child's judgment might not be as mature. The author is 20, so the age difference is 8 years. The brother's actions might have been influenced by the recent family conflict (the argument about the inheritance). The stepdad confirmed the mother wasn't involved in the brother's decision, so it wasn't forced upon him. However, the mother cut the author off the family tree, which adds to the tension. \n\nThe author's refusal to forgive seems to be based on the brother taking action at a young age and not responding to messages. But the brother is now trying to apologize. The author is holding onto past actions, which could be seen as holding a grudge. However, the brother did have the chance to communicate and didn't. The author might feel that after three years of silence, it's too late to reconcile. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If the brother was just a kid and the conflict was part of a larger family issue (the inheritance argument), maybe the author is being too strict. But the brother had the opportunity to reach out and didn't. The author's response is about consequences and accountability. \n\nAlternatively, the brother's actions, while impulsive, might not make him the sole wrongdoer. The mother's actions in the inheritance could have contributed to the brother's decision. The author is left feeling ostracized, which is tough. \n\nIn terms of forgiveness, the author isn't obligated to forgive someone just because they apologized. Forgiveness is a personal choice. The brother's initiative to apologize is positive, but the author's decision to hold onto the past might be seen as justified given the lack of communication over three years. \n\nI think the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong (B), because they are making a choice based on past actions and consequences. However, some might argue that the brother's age and the family dynamics mean the author should be more understanding. But the author's stance is about accountability and the brother's failure to communicate back then. So, B for No.\n"
