When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma\u2019s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn\u2019t want to see me anymore. \n\nI was upset but I gave him space thinking I\u2019d talk to him and explain he doesn\u2019t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it\u2019s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don\u2019t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn\u2019t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn\u2019t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for refusing to forgive their brother. The situation involves a family conflict over honoring a grandmother's wishes, which led to a falling out. The brother cut off contact when he was 12, which is a very young age, and the author is now refusing to reconnect after three years, stating that the brother should have a chance to think about his actions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The brother was 12 when he cut off the author. At that age, kids might not fully understand the consequences of their actions, especially if they're reacting to family tensions. The author's mother was involved in a conflict about the grandmother's estate, and the brother took sides. The author feels wronged because the brother chose to end contact then, and now wants forgiveness. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that the brother had three years to reflect and that his actions led to real consequences. They also mention that the stepdad confirmed the mother wasn't involved in the brother's decision. The author is holding the brother accountable for his choice at a young age. \n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nIn moral terms, forgiveness is often seen as a personal choice. The author isn't obligated to forgive, especially if they feel the brother's actions were a choice he made. However, some might argue that considering the brother's young age and the potential lack of full understanding, the author should be more lenient. But the author emphasizes that the brother's actions had real consequences and that he should have had a chance to think about it. \n\nAlso, the mother cutting the author off from the family tree adds another layer of emotional pain. The author might feel justified in their stance because they were excluded by the family, and now the brother wants to reconnect without taking responsibility for his past actions. \n\nOn the other hand, some might say that holding a grudge for three years without any communication is harsh, especially if the brother is genuinely trying to apologize now. However, the author is not refusing to talk out of spite but because they believe the brother should have taken responsibility earlier. \n\nConsidering all these points, the author's decision to withhold forgiveness seems to be based on their belief that the brother's actions had consequences. Since forgiveness isn't a requirement and they have valid reasoning, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
