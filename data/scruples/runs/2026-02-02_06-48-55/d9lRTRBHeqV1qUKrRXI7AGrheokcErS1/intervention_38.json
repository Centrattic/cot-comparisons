When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma\u2019s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn\u2019t want to see me anymore. \n\nI was upset but I gave him space thinking I\u2019d talk to him and explain he doesn\u2019t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it\u2019s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don\u2019t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn\u2019t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn\u2019t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person in the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong for refusing to forgive their younger brother. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author and their brother were really close until three years ago. The mom had a falling out with the author over donating Grandma's fortune to charities instead of keeping it. The brother, who was 12 at the time, cut off contact by removing the author from social media and games. The author tried to reach out, the brother didn't respond. Now, after three years, the brother wants to apologize and talk, but the author says no, emphasizing that at 12, his actions had real consequences and he should've dealt with it then. The mom also cut the author off from the family tree, and the brother's stepdad confirmed the mom wasn't involved in his decision.\n\nThe user thinks the author might be in the wrong but wants my opinion. The options are A for yes (author is wrong) or B for no. \n\nI need to consider the dynamics here. The brother was 12 when he cut off contact. At 12, kids are still developing their understanding of conflict and consequences. The author is holding a grudge for three years, which is a long time. The brother is coming forward to apologize now, showing a desire to reconcile, but the author is refusing forgiveness because they believe the brother had a chance to communicate before. However, the brother didn't respond to any messages, so maybe he didn't know how to approach the situation again. Also, the mom's cutting the author off might have influenced the brother's actions. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that the brother should've spoken up sooner, but maybe the brother was also hurt and didn't know how to handle the situation. The author is in a position where they're being rigid about forgiveness, not allowing the brother to make amends. Forgiveness can be personal, but holding a grudge for three years especially when the other person is trying to reach out... that seems harsh. The author might be right to be upset, but refusing to forgive when someone is trying to reconcile could be seen as the problem. Also, the brother's stepdad says the mom wasn't part of it, so maybe the brother made the decision on his own, which the author is acknowledging. \n\nBut is the author wrong for not accepting the apology? Maybe not entirely, but the approach of not giving any chance for reconciliation now might be seen as overly rigid. People can change, and at 15 (since three years have passed), the brother is older and might have a better understanding. The author is holding onto past actions, which some might view as unforgiving. However, the brother didn't explain his actions earlier, so the author's frustration is understandable. \n\nIn the AITA context, usually, the person is considered in the wrong if they're being unreasonable. The author is being strict about the timeline and not allowing for the brother's possible growth or a fresh start. So, maybe the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because they're refusing to let go of the past and not giving the brother a chance to apologize properly. But others might argue that the brother's initial decision to cut off contact was too impulsive, and the author has the right to set boundaries. \n\nI think the key here is whether cutting off contact was the brother's own choice. Since the stepdad confirmed the mom had no part, it's entirely the brother's decision. But at 12, his emotional maturity might not be high. The author's stance is that he should've taken responsibility then. However, expecting a 12-year-old to handle a family conflict maturely is a bit much. The author's refusal to forgive after three years, despite the brother now trying to reconcile, could be seen as not giving him the benefit of the doubt. So, maybe the author is in the wrong for not being open to forgiveness even though the brother is making an effort now. The answer might be A.\n"
