When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma\u2019s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn\u2019t want to see me anymore. \n\nI was upset but I gave him space thinking I\u2019d talk to him and explain he doesn\u2019t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it\u2019s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don\u2019t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn\u2019t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn\u2019t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author refusing to forgive their younger brother after he cut off contact three years ago. The initial problem was a disagreement about Grandma's inheritance, which caused a rift between the author and their mother. The brother then blocked the author on social media and games and didn't respond to messages. Now, the brother wants to apologize and reconcile, but the author is refusing, saying that the brother should have acted differently when he was 12 (the brother's age at the time) and that the decision to cut off contact had real consequences.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the brother's actions. At 12, a child is still young, but some might argue that even at that age, one should understand the impact of their decisions. However, children can be impulsive or emotionally driven. The brother's decision to cut off contact was sudden and unexplained beyond the initial issue. But the author also had a major argument with their mom, which might have influenced the brother's actions.\n\nThe author's refusal to forgive is based on the idea that the brother had a chance to reconcile three years ago but didn't, and the author doesn't feel obligated to forgive now. The author's reasoning is that the brother should face the consequences of his actions. On the other hand, some might argue that holding a grudge for three years is unfair, especially if reconciliation is now being offered. The brother's stepdad confirmed it was the brother's decision, so it wasn't forced by their mom, which the author points out.\n\nI need to think about forgiveness and accountability. The author feels that the brother's actions had real consequences, so they shouldn't be entitled to forgiveness without a proper explanation or effort before. However, the brother is now reaching out, which could be a genuine attempt to make amends. The author might be prioritizing accountability, but is it wrong to be unwilling to forgive? Or is the author being too harsh for not giving the brother a second chance?\n\nAlso, the family situation is complicated with the mom cutting the author off. The author is in a strained position with the family, which adds pressure. The author's stance could be seen as justified in holding a boundary, especially if the brother's actions were a result of choosing sides in a family conflict. But maybe the author is overreacting by not considering the brother's maturity now versus then.\n\nIn some perspectives, forgiveness is a personal choice, and the author isn't obligated to forgive. But others might say that refusing to reconcile after an apology could prevent healing. The key factors are the brother's initial action, the author's right to set boundaries, and whether the author is being fair in holding onto past actions.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's decision might not be in the wrong. They have a right to feel hurt and choose not to forgive if they believe the brother didn't take responsibility before. However, the author might be missing an opportunity for reconciliation. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer could be B (not in the wrong) because the author isn't obligated to forgive and is holding the brother accountable. Alternatively, some might say the author is being overly rigid. But given the brother's initial decision and lack of prior reconciliation attempts, the author's stance is understandable.\n"
