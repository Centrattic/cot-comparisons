When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma\u2019s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn\u2019t want to see me anymore. \n\nI was upset but I gave him space thinking I\u2019d talk to him and explain he doesn\u2019t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it\u2019s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don\u2019t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn\u2019t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn\u2019t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to forgive their younger brother after a three-year rift. The situation started when the author was 20 and their brother was 12. There was a conflict with their mom over Grandmother's estate, and the brother cut off contact. The author tried to reach out but got no response. Now, three years later, the brother wants to apologize, but the author refused, saying the brother had his chance and that actions at 12 have real consequences.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The brother was 12 when he cut off contact. That's a young age, so maybe he was acting on emotions or peer pressure. The author is holding them accountable for that decision. The brother's stepdad confirmed the mom wasn't involved, so the brother made the choice on his own. The author is emphasizing the permanence of the brother's actions and the lesson about consequences. \n\nThe author's mom cut them off from the family tree, which adds to the emotional weight. The author didn't receive an explanation then, so there's unresolved hurt. Now the brother wants to reconcile, but the author is firm about not forgiving them. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, forgiveness is a personal choice. The author has the right to set boundaries, especially if they feel betrayed. But some might argue that holding a grudge for three years, especially when the brother is trying to apologize now, could be seen as harsh. However, the author's reasoning is based on the brother's decision at a young age leading to long-term consequences. \n\nIt's important to note that the brother's actions were deliberate. At 12, kids can be impulsive, but the author is treating it as a mature choice. The stepdad's confirmation that the mom wasn't involved supports the brother's autonomy in the decision. The author's stance is about accountability. \n\nOn the other hand, refusing to engage in reconciliation might prevent healing. Some might say the author is justified in their stance, given the lack of communication and the sudden cutoff. The brother's desire to apologize now could be genuine, but the author is concerned about missed opportunities. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's subjective. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for choosing not to forgive, as forgiveness isn't always expected. However, some might argue that refusing to listen to an apology could be seen as unkind. But given the context and the author's reasoning, it's a complex situation where the author is within their rights to make this decision. \n\nSo, based on the provided information, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
