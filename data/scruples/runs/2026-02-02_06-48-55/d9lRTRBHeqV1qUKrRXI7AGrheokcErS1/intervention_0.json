When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma\u2019s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn\u2019t want to see me anymore. \n\nI was upset but I gave him space thinking I\u2019d talk to him and explain he doesn\u2019t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it\u2019s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don\u2019t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn\u2019t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn\u2019t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to forgive their younger brother. The situation is that the author and their brother were close until an argument about donating Grandma's fortune. The brother then cut off all contact, and three years later, he wants to apologize, but the author refuses.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is 20, and the brother was 12 when this happened. At 12, the brother's understanding of the situation might be limited, but the author is saying that his actions had real consequences. The author gave him space and tried to reach out, but the brother didn't respond. Now, the brother is coming back after three years to apologize. The author's reasoning is that the brother had a chance three years ago and the author wants to hold him accountable for cutting off contact, even if the brother is sorry now.\n\nThe user thinks the author might be in the wrong, but I need to weigh both sides. On one hand, the brother did cut off communication and didn't reach out again, which could be seen as a serious action. The author is emphasizing that at 12, the brother should have known better, and that his decision to cut off led to the loss of the relationship. On the other hand, the brother is now trying to make amends, and forgiveness is a personal choice. The author might be justified in not wanting to accept a delayed apology without understanding.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, forgiveness isn't always required, and it's their right to set boundaries. However, the brother's attempt to reconcile after so long might deserve some consideration. The author's response seems firm, which could be seen as holding a grudge, but maybe they feel wronged. The stepdad confirmed the mom had no part in the brother's actions, so the brother's decision was his own. The author might be valid in feeling that the brother's actions were intentional and that he should have communicated better.\n\nBut wait, at 12, the brother's maturity level might not be high enough to fully grasp the implications. The author is now 23, and the brother is 15. Maybe the brother's actions were more impulsive. However, the author is holding the brother responsible as if he were an adult. The key point is whether it's fair to expect forgiveness or to reject a later apology. The author isn't obligated to forgive, but maybe the way they handled it was harsh. The user says they think the author is wrong, but I need to check if the author's refusal is justified. \n\nThe author's mom cut them off, which is another layer. The author might be feeling betrayed by both the mom and the brother. The brother's sudden cutoff after the argument could be a reaction to the family conflict, not just the author. But the author is focusing on the brother's choice to cut them off. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit subjective. The author's decision not to forgive is their right, but the question is whether they're wrong in doing so. Since the brother is trying to reconcile, the author's refusal might be seen as not allowing closure. However, the author's stance that the brother should have known better and that the consequences were real could be valid. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because forgiveness is a personal decision and the author isn't in the wrong for choosing not to forgive. The brother's actions, even if from a younger age, were a choice, and the author has the right to hold that against him. But maybe I'm missing something. The author might be overreacting by not giving the brother a chance to explain, but since the brother didn't respond before and now is coming back after three years, the author's position could be justified. So I'll go with B.\n"
