When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma\u2019s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn\u2019t want to see me anymore. \n\nI was upset but I gave him space thinking I\u2019d talk to him and explain he doesn\u2019t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it\u2019s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don\u2019t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn\u2019t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn\u2019t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for refusing to forgive their younger brother. The situation involves a fallout three years ago when the brother cut off contact after a disagreement about their grandmother's inheritance. The author tried to reach out but wasn't responded to, and now the brother wants to apologize after three years.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points: The brother was 12 at the time, which is a child, but the author argues that at 12, actions can have real consequences. The brother chose to cut off the author, and the author gave him space but eventually stopped trying after no response. Now, the brother is seeking reconciliation, but the author refuses, stating that the brother had a chance three years ago and should be able to handle more time without contact.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the brother made a decision on his own (confirmed by stepdad), so they don't feel obligated to forgive. The mother has also cut the author off from the family tree. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for not wanting to forgive.\n\nIn terms of ethics and relationships, forgiveness is a personal choice. The author isn't obligated to forgive, especially if they feel the brother didn't take responsibility earlier. However, refusing to engage in reconciliation after three years might be seen as holding a grudge. But considering the brother was a child, maybe his actions were impulsive. However, the author's argument is about accountability and consequences. The brother had the chance to address it earlier but didn't, so the author is enforcing the consequence. \n\nSome might argue that holding a grudge for three years is harsh, especially since the brother is now seeking to apologize. Others might support the author's stance that the brother needed to take responsibility at the time. The key here is whether the author's refusal is justified. The author isn't in the wrong because forgiveness isn't a requirement, especially when there's a history of being ignored and a lack of accountability from the brother. The author's decision to refuse forgiveness based on past actions is within their rights. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
