When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma\u2019s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn\u2019t want to see me anymore. \n\nI was upset but I gave him space thinking I\u2019d talk to him and explain he doesn\u2019t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it\u2019s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don\u2019t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn\u2019t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn\u2019t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about the author refusing to forgive their younger brother after he cut off contact three years ago. The brother was 12 at the time, and the author was 20. The initial conflict was about a family argument regarding Grandma's inheritance, leading the brother to block the author on social media and games. The author tried to reach out but got no response. Now, three years later, the brother wants to apologize and talk, but the author refuses, saying the brother had a chance three years ago and that his actions had consequences. The author also mentions that the mother was involved in cutting the author off the family tree, and the stepdad confirmed the brother was the one who made the decision.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the brother when he made that decision. At 12, he's a child, so his understanding of the situation and the consequences might not be as mature as an adult's. However, the author argues that even at 12, his actions had real consequences. The brother didn't respond to messages, so there was no immediate reconciliation. Now, three years later, he's trying to reach out again.\n\nThe author is refusing forgiveness, citing that the brother had a chance three years ago. The question is whether this refusal is justified. On one hand, the brother acted impulsively as a child and then didn't follow up, which might have hurt the author. The author might feel betrayed and that the brother wasn't mature enough to handle the conflict. On the other hand, holding a grudge for three years could be seen as harsh, especially if the brother is now trying to make amends. The author's mother cutting them off the family tree adds another layer of hurt, so the author might be in emotional pain.\n\nBut the key point here is whether the author is in the wrong for not forgiving. Forgiveness is a personal choice, and there's no right or wrong in that. However, considering the brother was a child who might not have fully understood the impact of his actions, and now he's showing remorse, the author's refusal might be seen as holding onto past pain without allowing for growth. The author's reasoning is that the brother made a choice and must live with the consequences. But does that mean the author has the right to withhold forgiveness indefinitely? It's possible that the brother's actions were a result of his own emotional state at 12, possibly influenced by family tensions. The author's stance might be justified if they feel the brother didn't take responsibility earlier, but since the brother is now reaching out, the author might be missing a chance for reconciliation.\n\nHowever, the author is under no obligation to forgive. The question is about being in the wrong. If the author's refusal stems from valid reasons, like feeling wronged and the brother not showing remorse earlier, then maybe they aren't in the wrong. But if the author is being overly rigid and not considering the brother's growth, then they might be. The stepdad confirming the brother's decision suggests it was a personal choice, so the author's stance is based on that. It's a tricky situation because it's about personal feelings and family dynamics. The author's response is their choice, but from an external perspective, is it wrong? The answer might depend on cultural or personal beliefs about forgiveness. Since the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide based on the information. The brother's actions were at a young age, but the author's refusal is their right. However, holding a grudge for three years without considering the brother's current remorse could be seen as unyielding. Maybe the author is in the right to set boundaries, but if they're refusing without giving the brother a chance to explain or reconcile now, that's another angle. The author's reasoning about consequences is valid, but so is the brother's attempt to reach out now. It's a complex situation, but the answer likely depends on whether the author's refusal is seen as justified. Given that the brother was a child and the author is an adult, perhaps the author's stance is too harsh. But since forgiveness is a personal choice, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, the fact that the brother is now trying to apologize and the author is refusing might be seen as the author not allowing closure. Hmm, this is tough. I think the answer could be B (not in the wrong) because the author has the right to choose forgiveness, but some might argue A (in the wrong) for being too rigid. The user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong, but I need to base it on the facts. The brother was 12, the author is an adult, and the author is holding the brother accountable. Maybe the author is within their right to feel that way. But also, the brother is now trying to make amends. It's a balance between accountability and forgiveness. Since the author is an adult, they might have more emotional maturity to consider the brother's growth. Therefore, the author's refusal could be seen as not allowing for that growth, hence in the wrong. But again, forgiveness is not required. This is a tough call. I think the answer leans towards B, not in the wrong, because the author is choosing to protect their boundaries. However, others might see it as A. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Given that the brother was a child and the author is now refusing to acknowledge the brother's current effort, maybe the author is being unreasonable, hence A. But the author's reasoning is that the brother made a choice, so the consequences are his to bear. It's a matter of perspective. I think the answer is B, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the author is in the right because they're standing by their decision, even if it's not the most forgiving path. The final answer might be B.\n"
