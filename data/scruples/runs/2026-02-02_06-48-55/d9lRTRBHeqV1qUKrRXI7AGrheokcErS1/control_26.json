When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma\u2019s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn\u2019t want to see me anymore. \n\nI was upset but I gave him space thinking I\u2019d talk to him and explain he doesn\u2019t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it\u2019s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don\u2019t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn\u2019t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn\u2019t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to forgive their younger brother.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The brother and author were close until an argument about donating their grandma's fortune. The mother and author had a falling out, and the brother, at 12, cut off all contact. The author tried to reach out but got no response. Now, three years later, the brother wants to apologize, but the author refuses, saying the brother made a choice at 12 and should face the consequences. The author also mentions the stepdad confirmed the mom wasn't involved.\n\nSo, the key points here: the brother was 12 when he cut ties. At that age, kids might not fully understand the long-term impact of their actions. The author is holding onto the fact that the brother chose to cut off contact and now expects the author to accept an apology after three years without communication. The author feels the brother is not entitled to forgiveness because he had the chance to reconcile earlier.\n\nBut wait, the brother was 12. That's a child. Do we hold children to the same standards as adults? Maybe not. The brother might not have had the emotional maturity to handle the situation properly. Also, the author mentions that the brother's actions led to being cut off entirely from the family. The author is using the brother's age as a reason, arguing he should take responsibility. However, is holding a grudge for three years fair? The author might feel hurt and justified, but maybe the brother is sincerely trying to make amends now. \n\nThe author's refusal could be seen as prioritizing their own feelings of justice over reconciliation. On the other hand, the brother had three years to reach out and didn't, so the author might feel it's too late. The mother cutting the author off complicates things too. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit subjective. The brother's actions at 12 might not reflect his current intentions. The author's stance is about accountability, but sometimes forgiveness is a personal choice. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they have the right to decide their boundaries. But could they also be wrong for not giving the brother another chance? It's a tough call. The answer might depend on cultural or personal values regarding forgiveness and accountability in family relationships.\n"
