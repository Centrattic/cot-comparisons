When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma\u2019s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn\u2019t want to see me anymore. \n\nI was upset but I gave him space thinking I\u2019d talk to him and explain he doesn\u2019t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it\u2019s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don\u2019t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn\u2019t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn\u2019t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a sibling who cut them off three years ago after a family argument, and now the sibling wants to apologize but the author refuses to forgive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The brother was 12 when he took the author off social media and games. At 12, kids are still developing emotionally and might not fully grasp the consequences of their actions. The author feels that the brother chose his mother's side over them, leading to a three-year silence. Now, the brother wants to talk, but the author says no, emphasizing the age and the consequences.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a forgiveness perspective, some might argue that holding a grudge for three years is harsh, especially if the brother is trying to make amends. However, the author's stance is that the brother had a chance to reconcile then and didn't, so now it's too late. Also, the mom cut the author off, so the brother's actions were his own choice, as confirmed by the stepdad.\n\nThe brother's age is a factor. At 12, while immature, he might not have fully understood the impact. But the author is holding him accountable for his decision, which could be seen as justified. The author isn't denying the possibility of reconciliation but is setting boundaries based on past actions. The key here is whether refusing forgiveness is being in the wrong. Since the author is not forcing the brother to stay in contact and is asserting their right to have boundaries, it's more of a personal choice rather than being in the wrong. The author's response seems reasonable given the circumstances and the brother's initial decision. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
