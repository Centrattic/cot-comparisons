When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma\u2019s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn\u2019t want to see me anymore. \n\nI was upset but I gave him space thinking I\u2019d talk to him and explain he doesn\u2019t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it\u2019s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don\u2019t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn\u2019t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn\u2019t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for refusing to forgive their younger brother. Let's break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the background: The person and their brother were very close until three years ago. The conflict started when the mother and the person had a disagreement about their grandma's inheritance. The mother wanted to keep most of it, but the grandma's wish was to donate. After that argument, the brother (who was 12 at the time) blocked the person on social media and games. The person tried to reach out, but the brother didn't respond. Now, three years later, the brother wants to apologize and talk, but the person refuses, saying he had a chance to talk back then and didn't take it. They mention that the brother was 12, so his actions had real consequences, and they don't feel he's entitled to forgiveness. The mother also cut the person off from the family tree.\n\nSo, the key points here are the age of the brother when he acted out, the sudden cut-off without explanation, and the refusal to reconcile now. The person is holding a grudge for three years and is firm in their stance.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The brother was 12, which is a young age, and his decision might have been influenced by immaturity or peer pressure, perhaps even not fully understanding the weight of his actions. The author is holding onto this for three years without any contact. While the brother did cut off contact, the author's response is to refuse any reconciliation attempt after so much time. \n\nIn many cases, forgiveness and reconciliation require both parties to make efforts. The brother is now trying to apologize, but the author is holding onto past actions. The author's reasoning is that the brother had a chance to reconcile earlier but didn't. However, the brother was a child then, and his ability to make mature decisions might be questioned. The author is also cut off from the family, which adds to the emotional impact.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, the brother's actions were hurtful and abrupt, but the author's refusal to engage even after three years could be seen as harsh. The brother is trying to make amends, and the author's response is final. However, the author's stance that the brother should have taken responsibility earlier is understandable. The question is whether holding a grudge for three years is justified. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, forgiveness can be a personal choice. If the brother's actions were a result of immaturity, the author might feel that the brother needs to show more growth or understanding before reconciliation. But cutting off contact entirely without any attempt to understand the brother's current intentions might be seen as not allowing for personal growth. However, the author is within their rights to choose who they maintain relationships with. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether the brother's initial actions were unforgivable and whether the author's refusal is reasonable given the circumstances. Since the brother was a child and the author is holding onto a past decision, it's a nuanced situation. The author might not be in the wrong because they are prioritizing their own emotions and the consequences of the brother's actions. However, being closed off to reconciliation attempts could be seen as inflexible. \n\nConsidering all that, the author's decision might not be in the wrong because they are standing by their choice, but it's possible that some might argue they could be more open. However, given the information, the answer might lean towards B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
