When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma\u2019s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn\u2019t want to see me anymore. \n\nI was upset but I gave him space thinking I\u2019d talk to him and explain he doesn\u2019t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it\u2019s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don\u2019t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn\u2019t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn\u2019t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for refusing to forgive their younger brother. The situation is that the brother cut off contact three years ago after a family argument about their grandmother's inheritance. The author tried to reach out but the brother didn't respond, and now the brother wants to apologize and reconcile, but the author refuses, saying the brother had a chance three years ago and that he should face the consequences. The user thinks the author might be in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The brother was 12 when he cut off contact, which is a young age. At 12, some might argue that the decision wasn't fully thought out, and the brother might not have understood the long-term consequences. But the author points out that even at 12, actions can have real consequences. The brother took specific actions\u2014blocking on social media, not responding to messages\u2014and didn't engage for three years. The author waited three years and then refused to forgive, stating that the brother should take responsibility for his past actions. The stepdad confirmed that the mom wasn't involved, so the brother acted on his own.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not forgiving. Forgiveness is a personal choice, and people have different thresholds for it. The brother did reach out after three years, which shows a desire to mend the relationship. The author might feel that the brother had a chance long ago but waited until now. However, the brother was young and impulsive, and maybe the author's refusal is seen as holding onto past resentment. On the other hand, the author is emphasizing accountability and the consequences of the brother's actions. \n\nIn some perspectives, holding a grudge for three years might be seen as harsh, especially if the brother is now seeking reconciliation. But the author might believe that the brother didn't take responsibility back then and is only now trying to make amends. The mother cutting off the author from the family tree adds complexity, but the main issue is between the siblings.\n\nI think it's a judgment call. If the brother's actions were a result of immaturity and he's now genuinely trying to make amends, the author's refusal could be seen as unforgiving. However, the author has a right to set boundaries and require accountability. The key factors are the brother's maturity at the time, the duration of the silence, and the current attempts to reconcile. Since the brother was 12, which is a minor, his actions might not be judged the same as an adult. However, the author is emphasizing that even at 12, there are consequences. \n\nConsidering all this, I think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they are choosing to hold the brother accountable for his past actions, and forgiveness is not mandatory. The author's stance is about personal boundaries and responsibility, which is valid.\n"
