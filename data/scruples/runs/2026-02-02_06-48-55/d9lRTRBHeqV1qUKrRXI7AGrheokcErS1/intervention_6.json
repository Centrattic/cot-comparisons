When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma\u2019s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn\u2019t want to see me anymore. \n\nI was upset but I gave him space thinking I\u2019d talk to him and explain he doesn\u2019t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it\u2019s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don\u2019t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn\u2019t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn\u2019t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to forgive their younger brother. The situation involves a family conflict over Grandma's inheritance, leading to a fallout where the brother cut off contact. The author refused reconciliation attempts and now the brother wants to apologize after three years, but the author is refusing to forgive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The brother was 12 when he cut off contact, which is a young age. The author was 20, so perhaps they had a more mature perspective. The brother's action was a result of the argument between the author and their mom. The author gave him space but he didn't respond. Now the brother is trying to make amends after three years, but the author is holding a grudge.\n\nThe author argues that the brother chose sides and made a decision at 12 with real consequences. They mention the stepdad confirmed the mom wasn't involved, so the brother acted on his own. The author feels the brother isn't entitled to forgiveness because he had a chance to talk earlier.\n\nI need to evaluate if the author is wrong. On one hand, refusing to forgive might seem harsh, but the brother did cut off contact and didn't reach out for three years. At 12, maybe his actions were impulsive, but the author points out that even as a child, his choice had lasting effects. The author's stance is about accountability and the consequences of his actions. However, forgiveness can also be a personal choice and doesn't depend on the other person's actions. The author might be justified in needing time and not being ready to reconcile, especially since the brother didn't make an effort earlier. The mom's involvement in cutting the author off is another layer of family conflict.\n\nThe question is whether the author's refusal to forgive is wrong. The answer depends on cultural or personal beliefs. Some might see holding a grudge as being in the wrong, while others might support the author's stance on accountability. However, since the brother is now trying to apologize, the author's refusal might prevent healing. But the author's reasoning is that the brother had a chance to act earlier and now it's too late. \n\nConsidering all that, the author's position isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're prioritizing their own boundaries and the consequences of the brother's actions. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
