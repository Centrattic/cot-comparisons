When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma\u2019s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn\u2019t want to see me anymore. \n\nI was upset but I gave him space thinking I\u2019d talk to him and explain he doesn\u2019t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it\u2019s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don\u2019t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn\u2019t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn\u2019t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to forgive their younger brother. The situation involves a fallout between siblings due to a disagreement over their grandmother's estate, which led the brother to cut off contact. Now, three years later, the brother wants to apologize and reconnect, but the author refuses, stating that the brother had a chance to address it earlier and should face the consequences of his actions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author's brother took the initiative to cut off all contact after a family argument involving their mother. The author tried to reach out but received no response. Now, the brother is attempting to reconnect, and the author is refusing, emphasizing that the brother's actions at age 12 (when the incident happened) had real consequences. The author also mentions that the stepdad confirmed the mother wasn't involved in the brother's decision, so the brother acted independently.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for holding onto this grudge. On one hand, the brother made a choice to cut off contact and didn't respond to any attempts to reconcile. The author is asserting their right to set boundaries and not forgive someone who didn't take responsibility until now. On the other hand, some might argue that forgiveness is a personal choice, and holding a grudge for three years based on a past decision might be too harsh, especially considering the brother is now trying to make amends.\n\nI need to evaluate the ethical aspects. The brother's actions were hurtful and dismissive, but the author's response is to withhold forgiveness indefinitely. The author's reasoning is that the brother should live with the consequences of his actions. However, forgiveness is a complex issue. Some might say that the author has the right to decide whether to forgive, and if they feel the brother's actions were unforgivable, that's their choice. Others might argue that the author is being too rigid, especially since the brother is now seeking to apologize. The author could be seen as prioritizing their own peace over the potential healing of the relationship.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on the family. The mother cut the author off the family tree, which adds to the tension. The author is in a position of power here, deciding whether to accept the brother's apology. The brother's attempt to reconnect might be genuine, but the author is choosing not to respond, which could be seen as a way to protect themselves from further hurt.\n\nHowever, refusing forgiveness can sometimes lead to prolonged conflict and emotional pain for both parties. The author might be right in feeling that the brother should have taken responsibility earlier, but by holding onto anger, the author might be perpetuating the rift. It's also possible that the brother's attempt to apologize now is a step towards reconciliation, and the author is missing an opportunity to move forward.\n\nIn terms of moral judgment, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for choosing not to forgive. Forgiveness is a personal decision and not a requirement. However, some might argue that the author could be more empathetic towards the brother's growth and willingness to apologize now. The key point is whether the author's refusal is justified given the circumstances.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the answer hinges on the balance between respecting personal boundaries and the potential for reconciliation. The author has valid reasons for their stance, but there's also a case to be made for considering the brother's current efforts. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer likely leans towards B (not in the wrong) because the author is exercising their right to set boundaries and not forgiving based on past actions, which is a personal choice.\n"
