When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma\u2019s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn\u2019t want to see me anymore. \n\nI was upset but I gave him space thinking I\u2019d talk to him and explain he doesn\u2019t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it\u2019s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don\u2019t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn\u2019t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn\u2019t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to forgive their younger brother. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the background: The author and their brother were very close until three years ago. The issue started when their mom had a falling out with the author over Grandma's estate. The brother was 12 at the time and suddenly cut off contact. The author tried to reach out but got no response. Now, after three years, the brother wants to apologize and talk, but the author refuses, saying the brother had a chance three years ago and that his actions at 12 had real consequences. The author also mentions that the stepdad confirmed the mom wasn't involved, so the brother made the decision on his own. The mom cut the author off from the family tree.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the key points. At age 12, the brother made a decision to cut off contact, possibly influenced by the mom's conflict with the author. The brother didn't respond to any messages for three years. Now he wants to reconcile, but the author is holding a grudge, emphasizing the age and the consequences of his actions. The author's reasoning is that the brother had a chance to talk it out before and didn't take it, so forgiveness isn't owed.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, forgiveness is a personal choice. The author isn't obligated to forgive, especially if they feel wronged. However, the brother's actions at a young age might affect the author's judgment. At 12, children are still developing emotionally and socially, so their decisions might not be as mature. The author's stance is that the brother's actions had real consequences, which is valid. But does the brother's age mitigate his responsibility? Some might argue that a 12-year-old might not fully understand the impact of cutting off a sibling, especially if influenced by family tensions.\n\nThe author's refusal to forgive could be seen as justified if they believe the brother didn't take responsibility initially. However, the brother is now trying to apologize. The author is choosing not to engage, which could be seen as harsh if the brother is genuinely remorseful. On the other hand, if the author feels that the brother's actions were a choice and that the consequences are appropriate, then the author isn't necessarily wrong.\n\nAnother angle: The author mentions that their mom cut them off. This adds to the emotional weight, but the main issue is between the siblings. The author's decision to withhold forgiveness might be a way to set boundaries after being cut off and not getting closure. The brother's sudden cutoff and lack of communication for years could have caused lasting hurt.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, forgiveness isn't a requirement. The author isn't in the wrong for choosing not to forgive. The brother made a choice to cut off contact without explanation, and the author is asserting their right to hold that decision against him. The key is whether the author's actions (refusing to forgive) are wrong. Since forgiveness is personal, the answer is more likely B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
