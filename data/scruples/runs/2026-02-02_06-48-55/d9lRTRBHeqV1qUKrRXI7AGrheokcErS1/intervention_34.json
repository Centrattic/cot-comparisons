When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma\u2019s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn\u2019t want to see me anymore. \n\nI was upset but I gave him space thinking I\u2019d talk to him and explain he doesn\u2019t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it\u2019s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don\u2019t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn\u2019t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn\u2019t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to forgive their younger brother. The situation involves a fallout between siblings after a dispute over their grandmother's estate. The brother cut off contact when he was 12, and now, three years later, he wants to reconcile, but the author refuses.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The initial conflict was between the author's mom and the grandmother's wishes. The brother took sides by cutting off the author. At 12, children are still developing their understanding of complex family dynamics, but they can grasp consequences. The author gave him space, but the brother didn't reach out again. Now, the brother wants an apology, but the author refuses, emphasizing the age and consequences.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the brother had a chance to reconcile three years ago but didn't. The author also mentions the stepdad confirmed the mom wasn't involved, so the brother made the choice independently. The author feels the brother isn't entitled to forgiveness.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, forgiveness is a personal choice. The brother's action was cutting off contact without explanation, which is hurtful. The author's refusal could be seen as holding a grudge, but they have valid reasons. The brother's actions led to the loss of a relationship, so the author might feel justified in their stance. However, some might argue that holding onto anger for three years is unfair, especially if the brother is genuinely remorseful now. But the author's emphasis on the age and consequences might justify their position. It's a tough call, but the author's actions are their choice, so they might not be in the wrong.\n"
