When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma\u2019s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn\u2019t want to see me anymore. \n\nI was upset but I gave him space thinking I\u2019d talk to him and explain he doesn\u2019t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it\u2019s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don\u2019t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn\u2019t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn\u2019t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the question is in the wrong for refusing to forgive their younger brother. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the backstory: The author and their brother were very close until three years ago. The mother had a falling out with the author over Grandma's inheritance. The brother, at 12, cut off contact by removing the author from social media and games. The author tried to reach out, but the brother didn't respond. Now, after three years, the brother wants to apologize, but the author refuses, saying the brother had a chance three years ago and that his age means his actions have consequences. The author also mentions the mother cut them off from the family.\n\nSo, the key points here. The brother was 12 when he cut contact. At that age, kids might not fully understand the long-term effects of their actions. The author feels the brother chose to end the relationship, so they aren't obligated to forgive. The brother is now trying to reach out again, but the author is holding a grudge. \n\nI need to consider if the author is in the wrong. The brother might have been acting out of hurt or confusion, especially since he was 12. However, the author's response is to cut off contact permanently, which could be seen as harsh, especially if the brother never had a chance to explain himself. The author is holding onto past actions and not allowing reconciliation. \n\nBut then again, the brother didn't communicate for three years. The author might feel that the brother didn't take responsibility until now. The stepdad confirmed the mother wasn't involved, so it was the brother's decision. The author is asserting that the brother isn't entitled to forgiveness, which could be justified if the brother's actions were intentional and without explanation. However, the brother is now trying to apologize, so the author's refusal might prevent reconciliation. \n\nThere's also the family situation where the mother cut them off. The author is dealing with family estrangement. The question is whether the author is wrong for not forgiving. In some perspectives, holding a grudge for three years is understandable if the brother didn't take responsibility. But others might argue that forgiveness is a personal choice and the author isn't obligated to forgive. \n\nI think the answer depends on cultural or personal values. If the author believes in accountability and the brother's actions were willful, then the author isn't in the wrong. However, if the brother's actions were due to immaturity at 12, not understanding the consequences, then maybe the author is being too harsh. But since the brother is now trying to apologize, maybe the author should consider reconciliation. \n\nBut the author's reasoning is that the brother had a chance three years ago. The brother didn't respond then, so the author is holding that against him. The author might be in the right if they feel the brother didn't take responsibility initially. It's a tough call. I might lean towards the author not being in the wrong because they are holding the brother accountable for his past actions, especially since he was old enough to make decisions then. But the age of 12 is a factor\u2014some might argue that a 12-year-old's actions don't justify permanent estrangement. However, the author is emphasizing real consequences for the brother's choice. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they are choosing to hold the brother accountable for his actions, especially since he was old enough to make decisions and the author felt wronged. They are not obligated to forgive, and their reasoning about consequences is valid from their perspective.\n"
