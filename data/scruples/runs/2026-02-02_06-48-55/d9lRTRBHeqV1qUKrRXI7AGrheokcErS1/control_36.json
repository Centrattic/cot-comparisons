When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma\u2019s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn\u2019t want to see me anymore. \n\nI was upset but I gave him space thinking I\u2019d talk to him and explain he doesn\u2019t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it\u2019s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don\u2019t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn\u2019t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn\u2019t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to forgive their younger brother. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe user, let's call them Person A, had a close relationship with their younger brother until three years ago. The conflict started when their mom and Person A had a disagreement about how Grandma's fortune should be handled. The mom wanted to keep most of it, while Person A thought it should be donated as per Grandma's wishes. After this argument, the brother, who was 12 at the time, cut off all contact\u2014social media and shared games. Person A tried to reach out but got no response. Now, three years later, the brother wants to apologize, but Person A refuses, saying the brother had a chance to reconcile back then and that at 12, his actions have real consequences. The stepdad confirmed the mom wasn't involved in the brother's decision. The mom even cut Person A off from the family tree.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the brother's sudden cutoff without explanation, the age of the brother at the time (12), the length of the estrangement, and the refusal to forgive despite the brother's attempt to apologize now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if Person A's refusal is justified. The brother was 12, which is a young age, but not a child anymore. At 12, kids can understand consequences, but they're also still developing emotionally. The brother's decision to cut off contact seems drastic, especially without any communication. However, he was reacting to his mom's argument with Person A. Maybe he felt hurt or took sides? But since the stepdad confirmed the mom wasn't involved, it was the brother's own choice. \n\nPerson A might feel betrayed because the brother didn't want to hear their side and shut them out completely. They gave space but after three years of no contact, the brother is now trying to reach out. Person A says they don't owe forgiveness, which makes sense because forgiveness isn't automatic. They might need to process their feelings and see if reconciliation is possible.\n\nBut is it wrong to refuse forgiveness? Well, forgiveness is a personal choice. No one can force it. The question is whether Person A is being unreasonable. The brother's actions were hurtful, and it's been three years. The fact that the brother is now reaching out to apologize shows he might have matured and wants to make amends. However, Person A might need time and trust to rebuild the relationship. \n\nOn the other hand, Person A might feel that the brother's decision at 12 set a precedent, and holding that consequence for three years is necessary. But is that fair? The brother is trying to take responsibility now by apologizing. The refusal to forgive could be seen as holding a grudge, but if Person A hasn't received an apology for three years, maybe their stance is valid. \n\nThe mother cutting them off from the family tree adds another layer of conflict. The family dynamics are complicated here. Person A might feel wronged by both the brother and the mother. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the question is about moral judgment. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for not forgiving. Forgiveness is a process and not everyone can do it overnight, especially after such a long silence. The brother's actions were abrupt and without communication, which is hurtful. Person A has the right to set boundaries and decide if and when to reconcile. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because their decision is a personal choice and they have valid reasons based on the brother's past actions and lack of communication. The brother's attempt to apologize now is commendable, but forgiveness isn't a given. It's about respecting one's own feelings and needs.\n"
