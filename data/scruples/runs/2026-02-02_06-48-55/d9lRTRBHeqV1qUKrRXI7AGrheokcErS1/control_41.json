When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma\u2019s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn\u2019t want to see me anymore. \n\nI was upset but I gave him space thinking I\u2019d talk to him and explain he doesn\u2019t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it\u2019s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don\u2019t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn\u2019t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn\u2019t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to forgive their younger brother. The situation is that three years ago, after a family conflict about Grandma's inheritance, the brother cut off contact. The author tried to reach out but got no response. Now the brother wants to apologize and talk, but the author refuses, saying the brother had a chance three years ago and that 12 is old enough to face consequences.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the key points. The brother blocked the author at 12, which is a young age. The author feels that the brother made a choice and should face the consequences. The brother is now trying to reconnect, but the author is holding a grudge. The mother is cut off from the author, and the stepdad confirmed the brother acted on his own.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI should consider if holding a grudge for three years is justified. At 12, the brother's decision to cut off contact might not be fully mature. The author's refusal to forgive could be seen as harsh if the brother is trying to make amends now. However, the author might feel that after three years without contact, forgiveness isn't owed, especially if the brother didn't explain his actions back then. The mother's role in the conflict is mentioned, but the stepdad says the mother wasn't involved, so it's the brother's own choice.\n\nOn one hand, the brother might have been acting out of anger or pressure, and now wants to reconcile. On the other hand, the author's stance is that the brother's actions had consequences. The author might not be in the wrong because they're holding the brother accountable for a past decision. However, some might argue that the author is being too rigid, not allowing for growth or the brother's attempt to make things right now.\n\nIt's a bit of a moral dilemma. The key factors are the brother's age at the time, the lack of explanation, and the author's right to set boundaries. Since the brother was 12, his actions might not have been fully thought out. The author's refusal could be seen as protecting their boundaries, which is valid. But others might think that after three years, the author should reconsider. The answer would depend on cultural norms and personal values. In terms of right or wrong, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong if they believe in maintaining their boundaries. So the answer might be B (No).\n"
