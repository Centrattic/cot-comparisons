When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma\u2019s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn\u2019t want to see me anymore. \n\nI was upset but I gave him space thinking I\u2019d talk to him and explain he doesn\u2019t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it\u2019s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don\u2019t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn\u2019t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn\u2019t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for refusing to forgive their younger brother. The situation involves a fallout between siblings after a disagreement about their grandmother's finances. The brother cut off contact three years ago and now wants to apologize, but the author refuses forgiveness.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author and brother were close until an argument with the mom over donating the grandmother's fortune. The brother, at 12, took the author off social media and games. The author tried to reach out but got no response. Now, after three years, the brother wants to apologize, but the author refuses, saying he had a chance to talk three years ago and that at 12, his actions had consequences. The author feels the brother isn't entitled to forgiveness and mentions the mom cut them off.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my take. So, the question is whether the author's refusal is justified. Let's break it down.\n\nThe brother was 12 when he cut off contact. At that age, decision-making skills aren't fully developed. He might not have understood the long-term impact of his actions. The author is holding a grudge because the brother didn't reach out to explain or talk things out. The brother is now trying to apologize, but the author is refusing. The author's reasoning is that the brother had three years to fix it and now it's too late. \n\nOn one hand, the author has a right to set boundaries and not feel obligated to forgive. The brother's initial actions were hurtful and abrupt. On the other hand, the brother is attempting to reconcile, and the author is choosing not to engage, which might be seen as cutting off a chance for healing. The author's stance is that the brother should face consequences for his choice to cut off contact without explanation.\n\nBut maybe the author is being too harsh. At 12, the brother might not have known how to handle the situation better. The author's refusal might prevent reconciliation, even if the brother is now sincere. The author's position seems to stem from feeling betrayed and not wanting to be taken for granted. However, forgiveness is a personal choice, and the author is within their rights to not forgive. But is it \"wrong\" to refuse forgiveness? It's a matter of perspective. The author might be right in their own mind, but others might see the brother's effort as worth considering.\n\nThe user thinks the author is wrong, suggesting that forgiveness is important. But the author feels justified because of the initial lack of communication. I need to decide if the author is in the wrong. The key points are the brother's age, the lack of communication back then, and the author's current stance. It's possible the author is being reasonable in setting boundaries, but could also be seen as holding a grudge. However, since forgiveness isn't required, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. So the answer might be B.\n"
