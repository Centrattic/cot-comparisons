When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma\u2019s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn\u2019t want to see me anymore. \n\nI was upset but I gave him space thinking I\u2019d talk to him and explain he doesn\u2019t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it\u2019s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don\u2019t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn\u2019t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn\u2019t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to forgive their younger brother. The situation involves a fallout three years ago when the brother cut off contact after an argument between the author and their mom about their grandmother's money. The brother was 12 at the time, and the author is now refusing to reconnect, saying the brother had a chance three years ago. The stepdad confirmed the mom wasn't involved in the brother's decision.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The brother was 12 when he cut off contact, which is a young age, but the author argues that even then, actions have consequences. The brother didn't respond to messages for three years, and now wants to apologize. The author feels the brother isn't entitled to forgiveness because of his past actions. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, they might feel betrayed and that their brother took a side without understanding the situation. The fact that the brother didn't reach out for three years could be seen as abandoning the relationship. The author's decision to not forgive could be about holding the brother accountable for his decision to cut ties, especially given the brother's age. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that forgiveness is important, especially with family. The brother was young and maybe didn't fully understand the situation. The author might be seen as being too rigid, not allowing the brother to make amends. But the author also had to deal with the family cutting them off, which adds to the tension.\n\nI need to weigh the brother's age and immaturity against the author's right to set boundaries. The author's stance is that the brother made a choice and must live with the consequences. The brother's actions were final at the time, so the author isn't obligated to forgive. The refusal might be justified as a way to protect their own emotional well-being, especially after being excluded from the family.\n\nConsidering all factors, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have valid reasons for their decision, even if others might see it as harsh. The key points are the brother's age, the lack of communication, and the author's need to maintain boundaries. So the answer would likely be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
