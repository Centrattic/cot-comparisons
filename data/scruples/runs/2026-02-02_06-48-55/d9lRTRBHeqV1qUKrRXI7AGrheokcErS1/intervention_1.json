When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma\u2019s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn\u2019t want to see me anymore. \n\nI was upset but I gave him space thinking I\u2019d talk to him and explain he doesn\u2019t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it\u2019s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don\u2019t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn\u2019t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn\u2019t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to forgive their younger brother. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and their brother were close until three years ago. The falling out happened when their mom had a disagreement with the author about honoring Grandma's wishes regarding her fortune. The brother, at 12 years old, cut off all contact by removing the author from social media and games. The author tried to reach out but got no response. Now, three years later, the brother wants to apologize and talk, but the author refuses, saying the brother had a chance to address it earlier and that his actions had real consequences. The author's mom also cut them off, and the stepdad confirmed the mom wasn't involved in the brother's decision.\n\nThe author feels the brother isn't entitled to forgiveness because he chose to cut off contact without explanation. The user thinks the author might be overreacting but wants opinions.\n\nSo, to decide if the author is in the wrong: Forgiveness is a personal choice, but the brother was 12 when he cut off contact. At that age, kids can act impulsively, especially if they're influenced by their environment (like their mom's actions). The brother's decision might not have been fully thought out. The author is holding a grudge for three years and refusing to engage even after the brother wants to reconcile. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel betrayed and wronged. The brother didn't communicate further, leaving the author in the dark. The author's stance is about accountability and the consequences of actions. But does holding a three-year grudge justify not forgiving? Maybe not. The brother is trying to make amends now. \n\nForgiveness doesn't mean forgetting, but choosing to move past the hurt. The author's refusal could be seen as prioritizing their feelings and boundaries, which is valid. However, refusing to listen to an apology might also prevent reconciliation. \n\nConsidering the brother's age and possible immaturity, the author might be right to hold the brother accountable. But if the brother is genuinely remorseful now, the author's refusal could be seen as inflexible. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they have the right to decide when and if to forgive. The brother's actions had real consequences, and the author is standing by that decision. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
