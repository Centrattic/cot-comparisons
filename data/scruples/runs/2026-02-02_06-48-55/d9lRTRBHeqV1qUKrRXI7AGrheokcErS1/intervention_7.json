When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma\u2019s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn\u2019t want to see me anymore. \n\nI was upset but I gave him space thinking I\u2019d talk to him and explain he doesn\u2019t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it\u2019s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don\u2019t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn\u2019t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn\u2019t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about refusing to forgive their younger brother after he cut them off three years ago. The key points are the initial conflict over their grandmother's estate, the brother's sudden distancing, and the author's refusal to reconcile now.\n\nFirst, the author's brother was 12 when this happened, which is a young age. At that age, kids might not fully understand the consequences of their actions. The brother cut off communication, possibly influenced by his mother's argument with the author. The author tried to reach out but got no response. Now, after three years, the brother wants to apologize, but the author refuses forgiveness, stating that the brother had a chance to act then and that his actions had real consequences.\n\nThe mother's involvement is mentioned\u2014she's the one who had the falling out with the author, and the stepdad confirmed the brother made the decision to cut off contact. The author's mom also cut them off, which complicates family dynamics. The author feels justified in not forgiving because the brother didn't take the initiative to reconcile earlier and the author believes in holding them accountable for their actions when they were younger.\n\nNow, considering forgiveness and maturity. The brother is now older, maybe 15, and wants to make amends. The author is holding onto the past decision. But is it fair to not allow reconciliation because of an action from when they were a child? The author might be right in feeling hurt, but forgiveness is a personal choice. However, refusing to even consider reconciliation might be seen as harsh, especially if the brother is genuinely trying to make things right now.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might have valid reasons for needing time or not feeling ready. The brother's initial decision was to cut off contact, so the author isn't obligated to forgive immediately. The author's stance could be seen as a way to protect their emotions from being hurt again. There's also the aspect of the mother cutting them off, which adds to the family tension.\n\nI think forgiveness isn't a requirement, so the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for choosing not to forgive. However, completely cutting someone off for something they did as a child, even with understandable reasons, might be seen as being overly strict. The brother's current initiative to apologize shows growth, but the author's refusal could be seen as not allowing for that growth. However, the author's right to set boundaries is also valid. So, the answer depends on whether the author's stance is unjustified. Given the context, I think the author isn't in the wrong because they have their reasons, even if some might argue for more leniency.\n"
