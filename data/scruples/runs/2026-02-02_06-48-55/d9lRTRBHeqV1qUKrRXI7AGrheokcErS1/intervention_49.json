When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma\u2019s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn\u2019t want to see me anymore. \n\nI was upset but I gave him space thinking I\u2019d talk to him and explain he doesn\u2019t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it\u2019s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don\u2019t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn\u2019t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn\u2019t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to forgive their younger brother. The situation involves a fallout over a family argument about Grandma's fortune, which led the brother to cut off contact. Three years later, the brother wants to apologize, but the author refuses forgiveness.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are the reasons behind the brother's actions. The brother took the author off social media and games after a heated argument. At 12, he might not have fully understood the consequences, but the author is holding that against him. The author feels the brother made a choice to cut ties then and now isn't entitled to forgiveness. The mom also cut the author off, which adds to the tension.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the brother had a chance three years ago, and at 12, his actions have real consequences. The author is firm about not letting go of past grievances. But is that fair? Well, considering the brother's age, he was a child, maybe acting impulsively. The author is now adult, and holding a grudge for three years could be seen as harsh. The brother wants to reconcile now, so maybe the author is being too rigid. Also, the mother's involvement is mentioned, but the brother said the stepdad confirmed the mom wasn't involved. So the brother did make the decision on his own.\n\nBut forgiveness is a personal choice. The author has the right to decide, but the question is if they're in the wrong. If the brother acted out of anger as a kid and is trying to make amends, is it wrong to refuse? The author is prioritizing their own feelings and the past hurt, which is valid. However, some might argue that the brother's youth and desire to reconcile now means the author should be more understanding. But others might say the author is justified in holding the line. It's a tough call. The answer might depend on cultural or personal values about forgiveness and maturity.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide. The author's stance is that the brother had a chance and should have learned from it. The brother's actions at 12, while childish, might not warrant permanent consequences. However, the author's refusal could be seen as holding a grudge. But the author isn't obligated to forgive. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
