When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma\u2019s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn\u2019t want to see me anymore. \n\nI was upset but I gave him space thinking I\u2019d talk to him and explain he doesn\u2019t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it\u2019s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don\u2019t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn\u2019t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn\u2019t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the situation) is in the wrong for refusing to forgive their younger brother after he cut them off three years ago.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author and their brother were close until a falling out over a disagreement about their grandmother's fortune. The brother, who was 12 at the time, cut off all contact. The author tried to reach out but got no response. Now, after three years, the brother wants to apologize, but the author refuses, saying the brother had a chance to reconcile earlier and that the brother's actions had consequences. The author is also upset that their mom excluded them from the family tree.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know if that's the case. The options are A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nI should consider factors like the age of the brother when he cut off contact (12 years old), the maturity level at that age, the lack of communication from the brother, and the author's current stance. Also, the stepdad confirmed the brother made the decision independently, so the mother wasn't involved.\n\nOn one hand, the brother was still a child when he made the decision, which might affect his understanding of his actions. Cutting off a sibling is a serious step, but the author is holding them accountable for consequences. On the other hand, the author hasn't given the brother a chance to explain or apologize now, even though the brother is reaching out. Forgiveness can be a personal choice, and holding a grudge for three years might be seen as harsh, especially if the brother is genuinely trying to make amends. However, the author has valid reasons for feeling hurt and might believe the brother should have taken responsibility earlier.\n\nI need to balance these perspectives. The brother's actions were impulsive due to his age, and the author's refusal to forgive might be seen as holding past immaturity against him. But the author's right to feel wronged and the need for accountability is also valid. The key here is whether the author is wrong for not forgiving. Some might argue that forgiveness is a choice and the author is within their rights. Others might say the brother's youth should be considered, and the author could be being too harsh. Since the brother is now trying to reconcile, the author's refusal could prevent healing. But the author might believe the brother's initial decision was a mature choice despite his age, which complicates things.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because the author has valid reasons for their stance, and forgiveness isn't obligatory. However, there's a nuance where the brother's age might affect the situation. But the author isn't forced to forgive, so the answer is B.\n"
