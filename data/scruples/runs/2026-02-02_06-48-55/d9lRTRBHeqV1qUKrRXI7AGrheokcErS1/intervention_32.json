When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma\u2019s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn\u2019t want to see me anymore. \n\nI was upset but I gave him space thinking I\u2019d talk to him and explain he doesn\u2019t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it\u2019s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don\u2019t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn\u2019t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn\u2019t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to forgive their younger brother. The situation involves a fallout over a family argument regarding inheritance, which led to the brother cutting off contact. The author tried to reach out and was ignored for three years, and now the brother wants to reconcile, but the author refuses, citing the brother's decision at 12 to have real consequences.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key elements here. The brother was 12 when he cut off the author. At that age, kids are still developing their understanding of relationships and consequences. The author gave him space, tried to communicate, but received no response. Now, after three years, the brother is seeking an apology. The author's stance is that the brother had a chance to fix it but didn't, so they're not forgiving.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. But I need to evaluate both perspectives. On one hand, the brother's actions were impulsive and possibly influenced by family dynamics. On the other, the author is holding the brother accountable for a decision made at a young age without a clear explanation. The author's refusal might be seen as a lesson in consequences, but could also be viewed as overly harsh.\n\nThe mother's involvement is mentioned, but the stepdad confirmed the brother made the decision independently. The author's mom cut them off. The author's response might be justified if they believe the brother's actions had real consequences, but forgiveness can be a personal choice. The question is whether the author is wrong for not forgiving.\n\nIn some viewpoints, holding a grudge for three years could be seen as harsh, especially if the brother is now trying to reconcile. However, the author might feel they deserve to set boundaries. The age of the brother when he acted is a factor\u201412 is a child, so maturity could be an issue. But the author is an adult, so expecting forgiveness might be unfair if the brother didn't take responsibility earlier.\n\nI need to consider cultural norms, the role of family, and the concept of forgiveness. If the brother is now seeking reconciliation, the author's refusal might prevent healing. But if the author feels wronged and the brother didn't take responsibility, the author's stance is about accountability. It's a balance between forgiveness and personal boundaries. \n\nI think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because they have a valid reason to feel hurt and are choosing to set boundaries. Forgiveness isn't mandatory, and the brother's actions had real consequences. The author is prioritizing their emotional well-being by not allowing the brother to offload guilt after years of silence. However, this is a nuanced situation where both sides have valid points, but the core of the question is about the author's right to refuse forgiveness. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
