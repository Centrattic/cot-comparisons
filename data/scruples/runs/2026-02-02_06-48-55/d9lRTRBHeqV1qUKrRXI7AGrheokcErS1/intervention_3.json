When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma\u2019s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn\u2019t want to see me anymore. \n\nI was upset but I gave him space thinking I\u2019d talk to him and explain he doesn\u2019t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it\u2019s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don\u2019t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn\u2019t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn\u2019t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to forgive their younger brother. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe brother and the author were close until three years ago. The issue started when there was a fallout between the author's mom and them over Grandma's inheritance. The brother, at 12, took the author off his social media and games. The author tried to talk to him but got no response. Now, after three years, the brother wants to apologize, but the author refuses, saying he had a chance before and should deal with the consequences.\n\nHmm. The brother was 12 when he cut off contact. At that age, kids might not fully understand the impact of their actions. The author is holding them accountable for a decision made in childhood. The brother wants to make amends now, but the author is holding a grudge. The mother also cut the author off the family tree, which complicates things.\n\nI need to consider if the author is being unreasonable. The brother hasn't communicated for three years, but now wants to reconcile. The author's response is about consequences, but maybe forgiveness is separate from holding someone accountable. The brother might have grown and realized his mistakes. The author's stance could be seen as harsh because the brother is taking responsibility now. However, the author might feel justified if the brother didn't explain himself before.\n\nOn the other hand, holding a grudge for three years over a child's action might not be fair. The brother is trying to apologize, which is a positive step. The author's refusal to forgive could be preventing reconciliation. But the author also has the right to set boundaries, especially if they felt wronged. It's a tricky balance between forgiveness and accountability.\n\nI think the key points are the brother's age at the time, the lack of communication from him, and the author's right to their feelings. The author might not be in the wrong for not being ready to forgive, but maybe could consider the brother's efforts to reach out. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the brother initiated cutting off contact without explanation, the author's decision to hold firm could be seen as justified. But if forgiveness is expected in such situations, maybe the author is being too strict. I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because they are standing by their decision based on past actions, but I need to verify if there's a societal expectation to forgive such situations.\n"
