When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma\u2019s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn\u2019t want to see me anymore. \n\nI was upset but I gave him space thinking I\u2019d talk to him and explain he doesn\u2019t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it\u2019s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don\u2019t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn\u2019t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn\u2019t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about not forgiving their younger brother after he cut off contact three years ago. The brother was 12 at the time, which is around middle school age. The initial conflict was between the author's mom and the author about donating Grandma's fortune. The brother then took the author off social media and games. The author tried to reach out but got no response. Now, the brother wants to apologize, but the author refuses, saying the brother had a chance three years ago and that his actions had consequences.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the brother's age. At 12, children are still developing emotional maturity. Cutting off a sibling suddenly might not be a fully thought-out decision. The brother might have been acting on impulses or peer influence, not fully understanding the long-term impact. Also, the stepdad confirmed that the mom wasn't involved, so it was the brother's choice. But at 12, kids can be influenced by their parents or family dynamics without realizing it.\n\nThe author's stance is that the brother made a decision and should face consequences. They're holding him accountable, which makes sense because the brother didn't reach out again. The author's mom also cut the author off, which complicates things. The author might be feeling hurt and not wanting to be in contact with a family that's turned against them.\n\nHowever, forgiveness is a personal choice. The author isn't obligated to forgive, especially if they feel the brother didn't take responsibility until now. The brother's initial refusal to communicate or explain his actions might have contributed to the author's hurt. On the other hand, the author is being rigid by not even considering reconciliation now, given the brother's effort to apologize after three years.\n\nBut considering the brother's age at the time, the author's reaction might be a bit harsh. At 12, kids might not grasp the full weight of their actions. The author is treating it as an adult decision, which might not be fair. The brother now wants to talk, showing he's matured or regretful. The author's refusal could be seen as holding a grudge over something from the brother's adolescence.\n\nThe author's mom cutting them off adds to the family conflict, making it more about loyalty and family dynamics. The author might feel wronged and are protecting themselves, which is understandable. But is it right to hold a 12-year-old's actions against him for three years? It depends on the circumstances. If the brother genuinely wants to make amends now, the author might be missing a chance for reconciliation.\n\nIn summary, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for not forgiving, as forgiveness isn't required. However, being open to dialogue might be healthier. The key points are the brother's age, the lack of communication, and the author's right to set boundaries. The answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong (B), as they have valid reasons for their stance despite the time passed.\n"
