When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma\u2019s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn\u2019t want to see me anymore. \n\nI was upset but I gave him space thinking I\u2019d talk to him and explain he doesn\u2019t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it\u2019s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don\u2019t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn\u2019t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn\u2019t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation involves their younger brother cutting them off three years ago, and now the brother wants to apologize, but the author refuses to forgive. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, let me recap the situation to make sure I understand. The author and their brother were close until three years ago when a conflict arose between the author's mom and the author over donating Grandma's fortune. The brother, then 12, cut off contact. The author tried to reach out but got no response. Now, the brother is seeking to apologize, but the author refuses, saying the brother had a chance three years ago and that at 12, his actions have real consequences. The author feels the brother isn't entitled to forgiveness, especially since the stepdad confirmed the mom wasn't involved in the decision. The mom also cut the author off from the family tree.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider the context. The brother was 12 when he cut off contact. At that age, children might act impulsively, even if they make a decision that seems harsh. However, the author is now 23 (since the brother was 12 three years ago, and the author was 20, making the age difference 8 years; so now the author is 23 and the brother 15). Wait, but three years later, the brother would be 15, not 12. Wait, let me check the math again. The original event: when the brother was 12 and the author was 20. That means the age difference is 8 years. Three years after that event, the brother is now 15 and the author 23. So now the brother is 15. The author is refusing to forgive because they think the brother made a choice when he was 12, and the author is holding that against him. \n\nThe author's argument is that at 12, the brother's actions had real consequences, and he should have to live with that. The author is also upset that the mother cut off contact, and the stepdad confirmed the mom wasn't involved. The author is saying that the brother is not entitled to forgiveness because he didn't reach out before, and now after three years, it's too late. \n\nOn the other hand, the brother is now trying to apologize. The author is giving no chance for reconciliation. Is that fair? Well, the brother was a minor at the time. At 12, he might not have fully understood the implications of cutting off a sibling. The author is holding a past decision by the brother, made when he was a child, against him now. Is that reasonable? Some might say that people, especially children, can't be held fully accountable for their actions, especially when they were young. Others might say that the author has a right to set boundaries if the brother didn't take responsibility when he had the chance. \n\nThe author might feel wronged because the brother didn't give an explanation or try to reconcile earlier. The fact that the brother is now seeking to apologize might be genuine, but the author is choosing not to forgive. The author's reasoning is that the brother had a chance three years ago and didn't take it. But the brother was 12, perhaps too young to handle the situation maturely. The author is now 23, and the brother 15. The author might be expecting the brother to have learned from that decision, but maybe the brother was acting on emotions or peer pressure or confusion. \n\nIs it fair for the author to hold a grudge? Forgiveness is a personal choice, and the author isn't obligated to forgive. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong. If the brother's actions were a result of being a child and not fully understanding, then the author's refusal to forgive might be seen as harsh. On the other hand, if the author feels that the brother's decision to cut off contact was intentional and the brother should have matured enough over three years to reach out, but didn't, then the author's stance might be justified. \n\nAnother angle: the author tried to reach out, the brother didn't respond. Now the brother is showing initiative to apologize. The author's response is to say it's too late. Is the author right in not giving the brother a chance? It's possible that the brother matured and wants to make amends, and the author is not allowing that. The author might be prioritizing their own hurt feelings over potential reconciliation. \n\nThe author's own family cut them off, so maybe there's added tension. The author might feel vindicated in their stance because the family is against them. But is that a valid reason to not give the brother a chance? \n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. If the author is not in the wrong, then answer B. If they are in the wrong, answer A. \n\nI think the key points are the age of the brother when he acted, the author's own efforts to reconcile, and the brother's current initiative. The author is choosing not to forgive, which is their right, but the question is whether that makes them in the wrong. If the author is being unreasonable by not allowing the brother to apologize now, then they might be in the wrong. But if the brother's initial decision was a clear-cut choice and the author has the right to set boundaries, then the author is not in the wrong. \n\nSince the brother was 12, which is a young age where children can be impulsive, and the author is now 23, maybe the author is within their rights to feel that the brother's decision had real consequences. However, refusing to forgive might be seen as harsh, especially if the brother is making amends. The author might be in the right to choose not to forgive, but the question is whether they're in the wrong. \n\nI think it's B (not in the wrong) because the author is choosing to set boundaries and the brother's actions, while childish, might not warrant forgiveness if the author feels it's not deserved. However, others might argue that the author is being too rigid. But since the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, and the author is not obligated to forgive, I think the answer is B."
