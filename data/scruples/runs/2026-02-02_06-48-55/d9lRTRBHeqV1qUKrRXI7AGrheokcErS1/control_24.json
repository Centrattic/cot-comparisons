When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma\u2019s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn\u2019t want to see me anymore. \n\nI was upset but I gave him space thinking I\u2019d talk to him and explain he doesn\u2019t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it\u2019s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don\u2019t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn\u2019t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn\u2019t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a brother cutting off contact three years ago after a disagreement over their grandma's inheritance. Now the brother wants to apologize, but the author refuses to forgive, saying he had his chance and that at 12, his actions had real consequences. The mom is involved in the conflict, and the author's mom has cut them off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The brother was 12 when this happened, which is a young age. At 12, kids are still developing their understanding of complex issues like family conflicts. The author is now 20, and the brother is 15. The brother took the step of cutting off contact after an argument with the mother. The author tried to reach out but got no response for three years. Now the brother wants to reconnect, but the author is holding a grudge.\n\nThe author feels the brother isn't entitled to forgiveness because he made the decision to cut off contact without explanation. The stepparent confirmed the mother wasn't involved in that decision. The author's mom cut them off, which is a significant factor.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, forgiveness is a personal choice and varies by individual. The brother might have acted out of immaturity at 12, and the author is holding onto the hurt. The brother is now trying to reconcile, but the author is choosing not to forgive. The question is whether that decision is wrong.\n\nOn one hand, cutting off a sibling is a big deal, and the author might feel justified in needing time or not wanting to reconnect. On the other hand, the brother is trying to make amends, and some might argue that forgiveness is important for family bonds, especially if there's no malicious intent behind the past actions. The brother's age could be a mitigating factor, as 12-year-olds might not fully grasp the consequences of their actions.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the brother had a chance to explain himself three years ago and didn't, so now it's too late. But is it fair to withhold forgiveness indefinitely due to a past decision made in adolescence? The author's mom cutting them off adds another layer of family tension.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's refusal to forgive is seen as justified given the brother's age and the lack of communication. Some might say the author is being reasonable, especially if the brother didn't reach out sooner. Others might say that holding onto the grudge for three years is harsh, even if the brother was young. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, so the response should consider if their actions are morally or ethically incorrect.\n\nThe brother's decision to cut off contact was his own, not influenced by the mother according to the stepparent. The author is not wrong in feeling hurt and deciding not to forgive immediately. The brother initiating contact after three years shows willingness to make amends, but the author has the right to set their own boundaries. The author's stance might be seen as firm but not necessarily wrong, as forgiveness isn't always required or expected.\n"
