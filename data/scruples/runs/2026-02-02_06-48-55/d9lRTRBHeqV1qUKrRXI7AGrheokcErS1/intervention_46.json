When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma\u2019s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn\u2019t want to see me anymore. \n\nI was upset but I gave him space thinking I\u2019d talk to him and explain he doesn\u2019t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it\u2019s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don\u2019t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn\u2019t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn\u2019t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to forgive their younger brother. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, some background: The author and their brother were very close until three years ago. The conflict started when the author's mom and the author had a disagreement about honoring Grandma's wishes regarding her fortune. The mom wanted to keep most of it instead of donating it. Then, the brother, who was 12 at the time, took the author off his social media and their shared games. The author tried to reach out, but the brother didn't respond. Now, three years later, the brother wants to apologize, but the author refuses, saying the brother had a chance three years ago and that his actions at 12 had real consequences. The author also mentions that the stepdad confirmed the mom wasn't involved in the brother's decision.\n\nThe author is asking if they're in the wrong for not forgiving their brother. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nHmm. Let me consider different angles. \n\nThe brother was 12 when he cut off contact. At that age, kids might not fully understand the long-term impact of their actions. The author argues that the brother's actions had consequences, which is a valid point. But maybe the brother was reacting to the mom's argument with the author? If the brother felt he had to take her side, even if he didn't agree, but he was a kid. Could there be more context? The author didn't get an explanation, but the brother now wants to apologize. \n\nThe author is holding onto the past. Three years is a long time, and the brother is trying to reconcile now. But the author feels the brother should have acted earlier. However, the brother was a child and might not have handled the situation well. The author is being strict about accountability, but maybe forgiveness is also a part of family relationships. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is justified in being upset. They tried to reach out, but the brother didn't respond for three years. The author might feel betrayed. The brother's actions led to a three-year estrangement, so the author's stance that the brother needs to take responsibility could be seen as reasonable. But is refusing forgiveness entirely inconsiderate? The brother is making an effort to apologize now, which shows he might regret his actions. \n\nI think it's a mix. The author has a right to set boundaries, especially if they feel the brother didn't take responsibility earlier. But maybe the author is being too harsh. At 12, the brother might not have understood the gravity of the situation. The author is holding the past against him, but forgiveness is a personal choice. However, the author's reasoning seems valid: the brother had a chance to address it earlier. \n\nBut maybe the brother's actions were a reaction to the family conflict, not a personal vendetta. The mother's role in the argument might have influenced the brother. The author is saying the brother's actions had consequences, which is true, but family bonds can be complex. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because they're holding the brother accountable for his actions at the time, even if the brother is now seeking reconciliation. The author's response is about the brother's responsibility, not about being vindictive. However, maybe the author could consider the brother's maturity now and the effort to apologize. But the answer depends on whether accountability is more important than forgiveness in this case. \n\nGiven the information, I think the author is not in the wrong. They made their position clear and are standing by their decision based on the brother's past actions. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
