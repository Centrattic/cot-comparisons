When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma\u2019s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn\u2019t want to see me anymore. \n\nI was upset but I gave him space thinking I\u2019d talk to him and explain he doesn\u2019t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it\u2019s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don\u2019t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn\u2019t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn\u2019t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to forgive their younger brother after a falling out three years ago. Let me break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the context: The author and their brother were very close until three years ago when their mom and the author had an argument about handling their grandmother's estate. The brother, who was 12 at the time, cut off communication with the author. The author tried to reach out but got no response. Now, three years later, the brother wants to apologize and talk it out, but the author refuses, saying the brother had a chance to reconcile before and now isn't entitled to forgiveness. The mom also cut the author off the family tree.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the brother's age when he cut off contact (12), the fact that he didn't respond to messages for three years, the author's refusal to forgive, and the mother's involvement in cutting the author from the family.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the brother was 12 when he made the decision. At that age, people can act impulsively, and their understanding of consequences might be limited. The brother might not have fully grasped the impact of cutting off communication. Also, he's reaching out now to apologize, which shows he wants to make amends. The author's stance is that the brother had a chance to address it earlier, but maybe that's too harsh given the brother's age and immaturity.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is justified in feeling hurt. The brother didn't respond to any messages, which could have been a sign of not wanting to resolve the issue. The author's position is that actions have real consequences, and the brother should live with the consequence of losing contact. However, holding a grudge for three years might be seen as overly rigid, especially if the brother is sincere in his apology now.\n\nAnother angle: the mother's role. The mother's decision to cut the author from the family tree complicates things. The author might be feeling betrayed by both the brother and the mother. But the brother's actions were his own, as confirmed by the stepdad. So the author's resentment isn't entirely misplaced towards the mother.\n\nBut here's the thing: the brother is now trying to reconcile. The author is choosing not to forgive, which is their right, but the question is whether that's wrong. Forgiveness is a personal choice, and you can't force someone to forgive. However, refusing to even consider an apology might be seen as harsh, especially if the brother genuinely wants to make amends.\n\nHowever, the brother didn't give a reason for cutting off contact initially, and now is offering an apology. The author might need closure, which the brother is trying to provide. But the author is stating that the brother had a chance three years ago. The issue is whether the brother had the maturity to handle the situation then. At 12, maybe he didn't. Now he's 15, and perhaps has grown, so the author's refusal to meet him halfway could be seen as inflexible.\n\nIn summary, the author's refusal to forgive might be justified given the brother's initial actions and lack of communication. But the brother's effort to reconcile now could be a valid reason to reconsider. However, the author's stance is that the brother should have acted earlier, and given the brother's age at the time, the author might not be in the wrong for holding a firm boundary.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer hinges on whether the author is being too strict. Since the brother was a child when he made the decision, and the author is holding them accountable for consequences, but also refusing to engage now, it's a bit of a toss-up. But the key is that the author is not in the wrong for choosing not to forgive, as forgiveness is a personal choice, and the brother's actions had real consequences.\n"
