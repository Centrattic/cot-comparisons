When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma\u2019s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn\u2019t want to see me anymore. \n\nI was upset but I gave him space thinking I\u2019d talk to him and explain he doesn\u2019t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it\u2019s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don\u2019t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn\u2019t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn\u2019t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for refusing to forgive their younger brother. The situation involves a fallout three years ago when the brother cut off contact after an argument about their grandmother's estate. The author tried to reach out but didn't get a response, and now the brother wants to reconcile, but the author refuses.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The brother was 12 when he cut off contact, which is a child. At that age, maybe he didn't fully understand the consequences. The author is upset because the brother didn't give an explanation and their mom cut them off. The author feels that the brother had a chance to talk it out three years ago and now isn't entitled to forgiveness. \n\nOn one hand, holding a grudge for three years might seem harsh, especially since the brother was a child. People, especially kids, can act impulsively. The author might be justified in feeling hurt, but is refusing forgiveness entirely wrong? The brother is now trying to apologize, which shows he might have matured and wants to make amends. The author's stance is about taking responsibility for past actions, which is valid. However, forgiveness is a personal choice. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The brother's actions were hurtful, but the author's refusal to forgive could be seen as overly harsh. However, the author isn't obligated to forgive. The brother's age is a factor\u2014maybe he wasn't fully aware of the impact. The author might be protecting themselves from further hurt. \n\nBut the story says the author gave him space and tried to reach out. The brother didn't respond. Now, the author is standing their ground. It's a tough call. Some might argue that the author is justified in not wanting to reconcile because of the past actions and the lack of communication. Others might say that the brother was young and the author should be more understanding. \n\nIn the end, whether the author is in the wrong depends on perspectives. The author isn't necessarily at fault for choosing not to forgive, especially if they feel the brother didn't take responsibility initially. But the refusal might be seen as harsh. However, the question is if the author is in the wrong. Since the brother was a child and the author is holding onto past hurt, maybe the author is not in the wrong for making that choice. The answer might be B (No).\n"
