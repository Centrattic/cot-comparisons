When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma\u2019s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn\u2019t want to see me anymore. \n\nI was upset but I gave him space thinking I\u2019d talk to him and explain he doesn\u2019t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it\u2019s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don\u2019t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn\u2019t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn\u2019t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for refusing to forgive their younger brother.\n\nFirst, the context: The siblings were close until three years ago. A family argument about Grandma's inheritance led the brother to cut off contact. The author tried to reach out but got no response. Now the brother wants to apologize, but the author refuses, saying he had a chance to make amends earlier and that actions at 12 have real consequences.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to evaluate both sides. \n\nOn one hand, the brother took a drastic step by cutting off contact without explanation, which caused the author emotional distress. The author felt that the brother had a chance to reconcile but didn't follow through. The author's stance is that the brother needs to take responsibility for his actions, especially since he was 12 and aware of the consequences. \n\nOn the other hand, forgiveness is a personal choice, and the author is within their rights to set boundaries. The brother's decision to cut off contact might have been influenced by the mother's actions, but the author doesn't hold the mother accountable\u2014only the brother. The author's response is about holding the brother responsible for his past actions, even if it means not forgiving him now.\n\nConsidering the situation, the author isn't being unreasonable in their decision. The brother's actions were significant, and the author's response is about accountability. However, some might argue that holding a grudge for three years is harsh, especially if there's an apology now. But the author isn't rejecting forgiveness without a proper apology; they just feel the brother missed his chance.\n\nThe stepdad confirmed the mother wasn't involved, so the brother acted on his own. The author's position that the brother should face consequences is valid. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
