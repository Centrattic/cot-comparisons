When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma\u2019s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn\u2019t want to see me anymore. \n\nI was upset but I gave him space thinking I\u2019d talk to him and explain he doesn\u2019t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it\u2019s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don\u2019t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn\u2019t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn\u2019t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for refusing to forgive their younger brother. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the background: The author and their brother were close until 3 years ago when there was a fallout between the author's mom and the author over handling Grandma's estate. The brother, who was 12 at the time, took the author off social media and games, and didn't respond to messages. Now, three years later, the brother wants to apologize, but the author refuses, saying the brother had a chance before and that at 12, his actions had real consequences. The mom cut the author off from the family tree.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not forgiving the brother. Let me consider the key points here. \n\nThe brother was 12 when he cut off contact. At that age, children might not fully grasp the long-term consequences of their actions. The author argues that the brother's decision at 12 had real consequences, which is a valid point. However, the brother now wants to reconcile after three years. The author is holding onto past actions, possibly due to the mother's involvement in cutting them off. \n\nForgiveness can be a personal choice. The author might feel justified because the brother didn't reach out during those three years. On the other hand, the brother might have been too young to understand the situation fully. The author's stance is that the brother isn't entitled to forgiveness, especially since the brother didn't explain himself at the time and the mother was involved. \n\nBut is holding a grudge for three years necessarily wrong? It depends on the circumstances. The brother's actions were impulsive, possibly influenced by family tensions. The author might be right in setting boundaries, especially if the brother didn't make an effort to reconnect. However, the refusal to forgive could also be seen as harsh, considering the brother is now trying to make amends. \n\nAnother angle: The author's mother cut them off, which complicates things. The author might be protecting themselves from further family drama. The brother's current apology is sincere, but the author's response is firm. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, it's often about perspective. The author's refusal to forgive could be seen as justified if they felt wronged and the brother didn't take responsibility earlier. But maybe the author could have allowed some form of reconciliation, even if not full forgiveness. However, the author's reasoning about the brother's age and the consequences seems valid. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether the author's stance is seen as overly rigid or a necessary boundary. Since the brother was young and the author has valid reasons for not wanting to reconnect, the author might not be in the wrong. So, answer B (No).\n"
