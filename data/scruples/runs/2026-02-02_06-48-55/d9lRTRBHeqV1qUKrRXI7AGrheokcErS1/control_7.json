I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn\u2019t want to see me anymore. \n\nI was upset but I gave him space thinking I\u2019d talk to him and explain he doesn\u2019t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it\u2019s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don\u2019t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn\u2019t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn\u2019t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for refusing to forgive their younger brother. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the backstory: The siblings were close until three years ago. The mom had an argument with the author about donating Grandma's fortune to charities instead of keeping it. The brother, at 12, cut off all contact. The author tried to reach out but got no response. Now, after three years, the brother wants to apologize, but the author refuses, saying the brother had a chance to reconcile before and that 12 is old enough to face consequences.\n\nSo, the main points here are the initial conflict, the brother's sudden block, the lack of communication for three years, and the author's refusal to forgive now. The author feels the brother made a choice and should live with the consequences. The mom also cut the author off the family tree.\n\nTo determine if the author is in the wrong, we need to consider both sides. The brother was 12 when he cut off contact. At 12, some might argue that the child wasn't mature enough to make such a decision, especially given the family conflict. The brother might have been influenced by the mom's actions or the argument, leading him to take sides. However, the author is now saying that at 12, he should have known better and should face the consequences. \n\nThe brother didn't reach out for three years, so the author felt it was too late. The author's position is that the brother had a chance to reconcile before but didn't. The brother is now trying to apologize, but the author is holding a grudge. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, forgiveness is often seen as a positive action, but it's also a personal choice. The author might feel wronged because the brother chose sides and cut off contact, which is hurtful. However, the brother was a child at the time, and children can act impulsively. The author's refusal to forgive could be seen as holding a past mistake against the brother for a long time, especially if the brother is now trying to make amends. \n\nBut the author's reasoning is that the brother made a choice and should live with the consequences. The author might believe that the brother's actions were deliberate, even as a child, and that three years is a long time to not reach out. The author's stepdad confirmed the mom wasn't involved, so the brother did it on his own. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, the brother was a child and maybe didn't fully understand the impact. On the other, the author is choosing not to forgive, which can be a personal right. However, cutting off a sibling and not allowing reconciliation, even after the brother is trying to apologize, could be seen as too harsh. The author might be right in feeling hurt, but refusing forgiveness could be seen as the author holding onto resentment. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the brother's actions were a child's impulsive decision, the author might not be in the wrong for not forgiving. However, if the brother now wants to apologize and make amends, the author's refusal could be seen as not allowing healing. But the author's stance is that the brother had a chance before. \n\nI think it's a tough call. The author's position is that the brother made a decision that caused lasting harm, and the author is choosing to not forgive. The brother was 12, so maybe the author is being too harsh. But the author has the right to feel that way. So, depending on the perspective, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But if the brother is genuinely trying to reconcile now, the author's refusal might be inconsiderate. However, given the brother's initial decision and the author's reasoning, maybe the author is justified. \n\nIn the end, the answer probably leans towards the author not being in the wrong (B) because they're making a personal choice to hold onto their feelings, especially given the brother's initial actions. But it's a complex situation with valid points on both sides.\n"
