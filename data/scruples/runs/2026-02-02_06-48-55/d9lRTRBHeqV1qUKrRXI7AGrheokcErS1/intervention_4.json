When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma\u2019s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn\u2019t want to see me anymore. \n\nI was upset but I gave him space thinking I\u2019d talk to him and explain he doesn\u2019t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it\u2019s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don\u2019t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn\u2019t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn\u2019t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (who is the person in the \"AITA\" question) is in the wrong for refusing to forgive their younger brother after a three-year-old conflict. The situation involves a fallout over a disagreement regarding their grandmother's inheritance, where the brother cut off contact, and now after three years, he wants to reconcile, but the author refuses to forgive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The brother was 12 years old when he cut off contact, which is a young age. The author argues that his actions had real consequences, implying that at that age, he should have understood the impact. The brother hasn't communicated for three years, and the author is holding that against him. The stepdad confirmed the mother wasn't involved in the brother's decision, so it was the brother's own choice. The author feels that since the brother had a chance to talk it out three years ago and didn't, they're not entitled to forgiveness now.\n\nNow, thinking about forgiveness and maturity. Forgiveness can be a personal choice. The author might feel hurt and that the brother didn't take responsibility initially. However, the brother is now trying to reach out. The author's refusal is based on the brother not taking the initiative before. But holding a grudge for three years because someone didn't communicate when they were 12 might be seen as harsh. It's possible the brother had his own reasons for not communicating earlier, maybe immaturity or fear. The author is expecting accountability, but the brother is now trying to make amends. The author's response could be seen as prioritizing their own hurt feelings over the brother's attempt to reconcile. \n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't obligated to forgive, but the question is whether they're in the wrong for not doing so. If the brother genuinely wants to apologize and take responsibility now, the author's refusal to even consider it after three years might come off as holding onto resentment unnecessarily. The brother's actions were in the past, and now he's making an effort. The author's stance could be seen as inflexible, especially considering the brother was a child at the time. However, the author's feelings are valid; they might feel betrayed and hurt that their brother chose to cut off contact instead of discussing it. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a bit subjective. The author isn't in the wrong if they believe forgiveness isn't necessary here. But if the brother is genuinely remorseful, the author's refusal might be seen as an obstacle to healing. However, forgiveness isn't a requirement, so the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The key is whether the author's refusal is justified based on the circumstances. The brother's age and the lack of communication were factors then, and now he's trying to make amends. The author's response is within their rights, but whether it's the \"right\" choice depends on perspectives. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer would be B (No) because they aren't obligated to forgive, especially given the brother's past actions.\n"
