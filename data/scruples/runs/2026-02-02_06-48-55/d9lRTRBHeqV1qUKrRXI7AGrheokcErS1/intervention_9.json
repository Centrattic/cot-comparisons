When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma\u2019s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn\u2019t want to see me anymore. \n\nI was upset but I gave him space thinking I\u2019d talk to him and explain he doesn\u2019t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it\u2019s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don\u2019t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn\u2019t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn\u2019t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not forgiving their younger brother after a three-year estrangement. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the background: The brother and author were very close until three years ago when a conflict arose. The conflict started with a disagreement between the author's mom and the author over how to handle their grandmother's estate. The brother, at 12, decided to cut off contact by removing the author from social media and games. The author tried to reach out, but the brother didn't respond. Now, after three years, the brother wants to apologize, but the author refuses, stating that at 12, the brother knew his actions had consequences and that he should have taken responsibility then.\n\nThe key points here are the age of the brother (12 when he cut off contact), the lack of communication for three years, and the author's refusal to forgive. The author feels that the brother had a chance to resolve it three years ago and that the brother's actions had real consequences. The brother's stepdad confirmed the mother wasn't involved, so the brother made the decision independently.\n\nNow, considering typical perspectives on forgiveness and family relationships. At 12, a child is still developing emotional maturity. While some might argue that a 12-year-old can understand consequences, others might say that such a reaction is extreme for a child. However, the brother chose to cut off contact entirely without explanation, which is significant. The author tried to communicate but was ignored for three years. Now, after that time, the brother wants to reconnect.\n\nThe author's stance is that the brother should have taken responsibility earlier. But is it fair to hold a 12-year-old accountable in the same way as an adult? On the other hand, the author is now deciding not to forgive, which could lead to long-term family issues. However, the author also has the right to their feelings and boundaries.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the brother did take the initiative to apologize after three years, which shows he might have reflected on his actions. The author's refusal might be seen as not giving the brother a chance to make amends, especially if the brother is genuinely remorseful. However, the author might feel justified in their stance because the brother didn't communicate for three years and the initial action was a significant breach of their relationship.\n\nDifferent people might have different views. Some might argue that the author is right to hold a boundary, while others might say that forgiveness is necessary for family healing. The answer hinges on whether the brother's age and lack of maturity mitigate his responsibility, and whether the author's refusal is reasonable given the circumstances.\n\nI'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because they set boundaries and waited for the brother to come to them. But others might see it as overly harsh. However, since the brother was a minor and the author is an adult, the expectations might differ. But the author's right to their feelings is valid.\n"
