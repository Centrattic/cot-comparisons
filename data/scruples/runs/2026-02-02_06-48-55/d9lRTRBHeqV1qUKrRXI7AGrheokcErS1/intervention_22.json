When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma\u2019s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn\u2019t want to see me anymore. \n\nI was upset but I gave him space thinking I\u2019d talk to him and explain he doesn\u2019t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it\u2019s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don\u2019t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn\u2019t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn\u2019t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to forgive their younger brother after he cut off contact three years ago. The context is that the author and their brother were close until a family argument about a deceased grandmother's wishes. The brother, at 12, took the author off social media and games. The author tried to reach out but got no response. Now the brother wants to apologize, but the author refuses, citing his age at the time and the consequences of his actions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The brother was 12 years old when he cut off contact. At that age, emotional maturity is still developing, and their judgment might not be as sound as adults. The author is now refusing to forgive, emphasizing that actions at 12 can have real consequences. However, the brother is now trying to apologize and reconcile after three years. \n\nThe author's perspective is that the brother had a chance to work things out but didn't take it, and now the author is holding him accountable. The author's reasoning is that the brother should understand the consequences of his actions. But is holding a grudge for three years and refusing to reconcile when the other person is seeking forgiveness justified? \n\nOn the other hand, the brother's actions were abrupt and possibly influenced by the family conflict. At 12, he might not have fully grasped the impact of his decisions. The author's refusal might be seen as cutting off a chance for reconciliation, especially since the brother is now reaching out. \n\nHowever, the author also has the right to set boundaries, especially if they feel wronged. The mother's involvement in the initial conflict might have contributed to the brother's actions. The author's stance could be about protecting themselves from further hurt, given that the brother didn't engage in dialogue before. \n\nBut forgiveness is a personal choice, and not forgiving isn't inherently wrong. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the brother is genuinely seeking reconciliation, the author's refusal to even consider it might be seen as harsh, given the brother's youth and the passage of time. \n\nConsidering all factors, the author might be in the right not to forgive, but the situation is nuanced. However, completely cutting off contact without any attempt at reconciliation when the other person is trying could be seen as unkind. The key points are the brother's age, the sudden cutoff without explanation, and the author's refusal to engage now. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's refusal is seen as justified self-protection or overly rigid. Since the brother is now seeking an apology, and the author is holding past actions against him, it's possible the author is in the wrong for not allowing closure or forgiveness. But the author's perspective is valid too. It's a tough call, but leaning towards the author being in the wrong for refusing to engage when reconciliation is offered.\n"
