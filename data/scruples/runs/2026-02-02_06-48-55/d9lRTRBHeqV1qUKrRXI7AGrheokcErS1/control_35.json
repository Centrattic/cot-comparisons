When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma\u2019s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn\u2019t want to see me anymore. \n\nI was upset but I gave him space thinking I\u2019d talk to him and explain he doesn\u2019t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it\u2019s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don\u2019t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn\u2019t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn\u2019t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to forgive their younger brother. The situation is a bit complex. The siblings were close until three years ago when the brother cut off contact after an argument between the author and their mom about Grandma's fortune. The brother was 12 at the time, and the author is now refusing to reconnect, saying the brother had a chance three years ago and should face consequences.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the brother's age. At 12, he's a child, and his actions might not be as calculated as an adult's. The author is 20, so there's a nine-year age gap. The brother's decision to cut off contact was likely influenced by the family conflict and maybe parental pressure. The mom even cut the author off the family tree, which adds to the tension. \n\nThe author is holding onto the brother's past decision, emphasizing that at 12, the brother should understand consequences. But is it fair to hold a child's actions from three years ago against them? Forgiveness is a personal choice, and the author isn't obligated to forgive. However, the brother is now trying to reconcile, and the author is dismissing that effort. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that the brother had a chance to talk it out before but didn't, so now it's too late. But three years is a long time for a child to mature. Maybe the brother had his own reasons for not responding, or he's changed. The author is using the brother's youth as a point, but that could also mean he lacked the maturity to handle the conflict then. \n\nThe stepdad confirmed the mom wasn't involved in the brother's decision, so the brother acted on his own. But again, at 12, his judgment isn't fully developed. The author might be punishing the brother for a past mistake, which could be seen as harsh. However, the author isn't in the wrong for choosing not to forgive, as they are within their rights to set boundaries. The key here is whether the author's refusal is justified given the circumstances. \n\nForgiveness isn't a requirement, so the author isn't wrong for not forgiving. They are not obligated to reconcile, especially if they feel the brother didn't take responsibility at the time. The brother's attempt to apologize now might be genuine, but the author is entitled to their response. The answer would likely be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because they're making a personal choice based on their feelings and the situation's history.\n"
