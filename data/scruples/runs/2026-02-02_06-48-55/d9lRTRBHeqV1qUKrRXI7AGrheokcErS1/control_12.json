When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma\u2019s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn\u2019t want to see me anymore. \n\nI was upset but I gave him space thinking I\u2019d talk to him and explain he doesn\u2019t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it\u2019s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don\u2019t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn\u2019t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn\u2019t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to forgive their younger brother. The situation is that the brother cut off contact after the author had a falling out with their mom about donating their grandma's money. The brother was 12 at the time, and now three years later, he wants to apologize. The author refuses, saying the brother had a chance to reconcile before and that his actions had consequences.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the brother's age. At 12, he's a child, so his actions might be influenced by immaturity and his mother's influence. The author might be holding onto the hurt because the brother didn't communicate and didn't reach out again. On the other hand, the author is being strict about consequences, maybe expecting the brother to take responsibility as an adult now. \n\nThe brother's decision to cut off contact was sudden and without explanation. Now, he's trying to apologize, but the author is refusing forgiveness. The stepdad confirmed that the mom wasn't involved, so the brother made the choice on his own. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that the brother had a chance to reconcile three years ago and didn't, so now he needs to face the consequences. The author might feel that forgiveness isn't owed, especially if they believe the brother didn't try hard enough. However, some might argue that holding a grudge for three years, especially when the brother is now trying to make amends, could be too harsh. \n\nBut considering the brother was a child at the time, his actions might not be seen as malicious. The author might be right in expecting some responsibility from the brother, but maybe the brother's apology now is genuine. The answer hinges on whether forgiveness is a necessity or a choice. The author isn't in the wrong for choosing not to forgive, as people can have different boundaries. However, some might say that the brother was just a kid and deserves a second chance. \n\nI think the key points are the brother's age, the sudden cut-off without communication, and the author's right to set boundaries. The author isn't wrong for not forgiving, especially if they feel the brother didn't take enough responsibility initially.\n"
