Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband with a history of affairs who agreed to specific guidelines set by their therapist to rebuild trust. The guidelines include being home by 10 PM and not drinking with women. The husband breaks this agreement by staying out past 10, then argues with the wife, and even uses another person (\"Jim\") to justify his actions.\n\nFirst, the husband has a history of infidelity, which is a significant breach of trust. The therapist's guidelines are part of a structured effort to rebuild that trust. The husband agreed to these terms, so when he violates them, he's breaking the agreement they both committed to. The wife is enforcing the agreed-upon rules, which is reasonable, especially after past transgressions. \n\nThe husband's argument that \"it's just one guy\" and that the women have left doesn't excuse his behavior. The key issue is his commitment to the agreed boundaries. The fact that he came home late and then tried to shift blame onto \"Jim\" by saying Jim is mad at the wife adds another layer of manipulation or guilt-tripping, which is problematic. \n\nThe wife's reaction\u2014expressing her anger and stating that she'll leave if he doesn't commit to fixing the marriage\u2014is a valid response to his continued disregard for their agreed terms and the therapist's advice. She's holding him accountable, which is necessary in a situation where trust has been broken. \n\nConsidering all this, the husband's actions (breaking the agreement, arguing, and shifting blame) are in the wrong. The wife is within her rights to enforce the boundaries they set together. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
