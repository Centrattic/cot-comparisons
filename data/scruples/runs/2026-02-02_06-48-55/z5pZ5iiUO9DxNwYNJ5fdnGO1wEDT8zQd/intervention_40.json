Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a husband who's been unfaithful, they're in therapy, and there's an agreement about him being home by 10 and not drinking with women. He breaks that agreement by staying out late, and the author confronts him. The husband argues, and they fight. The author then threatens to leave. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The husband has a history of affairs, which is a big issue. The couple and their therapist set guidelines to rebuild trust. The husband agreed to these rules but broke them. He tried to make excuses about just one guy and not drinking anymore. The author is upset because he broke his word and used \"Jim\" to guilt-trip her. The husband then dismisses her concerns and says the rule isn't doable.\n\nThe author's actions were to enforce the agreed-upon rules. She stood her ground when he tried to bend the rules. Her anger is justified given his history of infidelity and breaking promises. She also communicated her needs clearly. The husband's behavior shows a lack of commitment to the agreement and the marriage. He's not taking accountability, which the therapist emphasized was necessary.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is wrong, but from what I see, the author is not in the wrong. The husband violated the agreed terms and didn't take her feelings seriously. The author's actions are about maintaining trust and setting boundaries, which are crucial in their situation. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
