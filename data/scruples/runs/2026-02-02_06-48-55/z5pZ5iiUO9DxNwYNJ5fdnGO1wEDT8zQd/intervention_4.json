Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband with multiple affairs who agreed to certain boundaries during therapy, like being home by 10 PM and not drinking with women. The husband breaks the agreement by staying out past 10, using the excuse that \"it's just me and Jim,\" and then argues about the rules. The author is angry and confronts him, leading to a big fight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The husband has a history of affairs, and the couple's therapist set up these guidelines as part of rebuilding trust. The husband agreed to these boundaries. When he breaks them, it's a direct violation of what he committed to. The author is standing by the agreed-upon rules, which makes sense in the context of working through therapy to fix the marriage. \n\nThe husband's actions\u2014staying out past the agreed time, using an excuse involving another person, and then dismissing the rule as not doable\u2014could be seen as dismissive of the author's needs and the therapeutic process. His response that \"10 isn't doable\" after only a few instances might be a way to avoid accountability. \n\nThe author's reaction\u2014telling him she'll go back to her family if he doesn't commit to fixing the marriage\u2014is a strong stance, but given the history of infidelity and the need to rebuild trust, it's understandable. She's trying to enforce the boundaries they set together. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author is being too strict, especially if the husband is trying to adjust or if the situation is a one-time slip. But considering the severity of the husband's past actions and the importance of consistency in rebuilding trust, the author's insistence on the agreed rules seems justified. \n\nThe key points here are: mutual agreement during therapy, the husband's breach of trust, and the author's attempt to hold him accountable. The husband's behavior undermines the therapeutic process and the rebuilding of trust, which is crucial in such cases. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for standing her ground.\n"
