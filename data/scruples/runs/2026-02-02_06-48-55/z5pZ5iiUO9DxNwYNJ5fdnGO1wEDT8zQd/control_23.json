Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" story is in the wrong. The key points are:\n\n1. The husband has a history of multiple affairs.\n2. They worked with a therapist to set guidelines: being home by 10 PM and not drinking with women.\n3. The husband agreed to these rules.\n4. He went out with friends, asked to stay out past 10, leading to an argument.\n5. The author (wife) enforced the agreed-upon rules, leading to a fight.\n6. The husband later broke the agreement again, saying the rules aren't doable.\n\nFirst, the husband has a pattern of infidelity, which is a serious issue. The couple's therapist recommended these guidelines to rebuild trust. The wife is following the therapist's advice by holding her husband accountable. When he violates the agreed terms, she expresses her need for him to stick to the rules. The husband then argues, tries to justify staying out, and breaches the agreement again, which undermines trust-building.\n\nThe wife's actions seem justified as she's maintaining boundaries set through professional guidance. Her anger stems from his dishonesty and non-compliance. The husband is the one who broke the rules he agreed to, so the wife isn't in the wrong here. The question is about accountability and whether the wife is being unreasonable. Given the context of past infidelity and therapy recommendations, her stance is reasonable. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
