Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their husband to come home after he broke an agreement. The situation involves a husband with multiple affairs, and they had therapy sessions where they set guidelines. The specific rule was that he should be home by 10 PM for a month, and not drink with women. He went out with friends, including someone named Jim, and decided to stay out past the agreed time, even though he initially said he would be home. The author insisted he return by 10, which led to a big fight. The husband then came home late, argued that being home before 11 was sufficient, and blamed the author for making \"Jim\" angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of their agreement. They had a therapist's guidance to establish these rules to rebuild trust after the affairs. The husband agreed to the guidelines, so breaking them could be seen as not respecting the agreement. The author is enforcing the terms they set together, which is reasonable for rebuilding trust. The husband's actions of staying out and then arguing about the time might indicate a lack of commitment to the agreed-upon boundaries. \n\nThe author's anger stems from the betrayal and the need for consistency in the rules. Insisting on the agreed time isn't being unrealistic but rather holding the husband accountable. The husband's reaction\u2014whining and blaming \"Jim\"\u2014could be seen as deflecting responsibility. The fight that resulted from this might be a consequence of the husband's non-compliance, not the author's demand. \n\nHowever, I should also consider if the author's response was proportionate. Telling the husband to come home immediately during the argument might have escalated the situation. But given the context of past infidelity and the therapeutic guidelines, the author's need for the husband to adhere strictly to the rules is valid. The husband's refusal to follow the agreed terms and his dismissive attitude toward the rules might justify the author's frustration. \n\nIn summary, the author is trying to maintain the trust-building measures agreed upon in therapy. The husband's failure to comply and his attempts to justify his actions seem to undermine the process. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for enforcing the rules they set together. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
