Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the wife) is in the wrong for telling her husband to come home on time after he had agreed to certain guidelines following his affairs.\n\nFirst, the husband has a history of infidelity, which is a serious issue. The therapist recommended accountability and guidelines, including a 10 PM curfew and avoiding drinking with women. The husband initially agreed but then stayed out past the agreed time, using his friend Jim as an excuse. The wife confronts him, leading to a big fight where she threatens to leave if he doesn't commit to fixing the marriage. He later arrives late, justifies it, and says the curfew isn't doable anymore. The question is whether the wife is wrong for being upset and enforcing the rules.\n\nThe wife is within her rights to expect her husband to follow the agreed-upon guidelines, especially after his history. The therapist's advice was to set boundaries for trust-building. By breaking the curfew and dismissing the agreement, the husband is not taking the necessary steps to rebuild trust. The wife's anger stems from a place of hurt and a need for accountability. She's not being unreasonable by holding him to the terms they both agreed on. His reaction, making excuses and blaming her for Jim's feelings, shifts responsibility away from himself. Therefore, the wife isn't in the wrong for standing up for her needs and the agreed-upon rules.\n"
