Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband with multiple affairs, and the couple has set boundaries through therapy. The specific incident is about the husband breaking an agreement to be home by 10 PM. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the agreements they made. The husband agreed to be home by 10 and not drink with women. He went out with friends, assured his wife he'd be home on time, but then asked to stay out with just one friend, Jim. The wife made a clear request based on the therapist's guidelines, and the husband argued and broke the agreement. \n\nThe wife's actions: She stood her ground, emphasized the importance of rebuilding trust, and after a fight, he came home late. The husband later dismissed the rule, saying 10 PM isn't feasible. The key points here are mutual agreements, the husband's breach of trust, and the wife's attempt to hold him accountable. \n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but is unsure. I need to evaluate if the wife overstepped. The husband agreed to the rules, so the wife is within her right to enforce them. The husband's refusal to follow through and his arguments suggest he's not taking the agreement seriously. The wife's frustration is justified given the history of affairs and the need to rebuild trust. \n\nAlso, the husband's behavior of trying to guilt-trip her with \"Jim\" and dismissing the agreed-upon time shows a lack of commitment to the therapy's guidelines. The wife's anger stems from his betrayal and unwillingness to change. \n\nConsidering these factors, the author (the wife) isn't in the wrong. She's upholding the agreements they both made in therapy. The husband is the one breaking the rules, not her. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
