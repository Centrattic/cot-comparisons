Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the wife) is in the wrong for telling her husband to come home after he broke their agreed-upon rules.\n\nFirst, the husband has a history of affairs. They've been working with a therapist to rebuild trust, and part of the plan is that he agrees to be home by 10 PM and not drink with women. Last night, he went out with friends, assured her he'd be home by 10, but then at 9:50, he asked if he could stay out with just one friend, Jim. The wife insists he come home as agreed, leading to a big fight. He ends up coming home 45 minutes late, argues that 10 PM isn't feasible, and mentions Jim is now mad at her.\n\nThe key points here are the agreed boundaries, the husband breaking them, and the wife's reaction. The husband had agreed to the rules in therapy, so when he breaks them, the wife is within her rights to enforce them. His excuses (only one friend, Jim) don't align with the agreed terms. The wife is trying to rebuild trust, which is crucial after infidelity. His behavior undermines that trust, and her anger is a valid response to his lack of accountability.\n\nHe's also trying to shift blame by saying Jim is mad at her, which might be a manipulation tactic. The wife standing her ground is necessary for the marriage's health. The therapist's guidance supports her stance. So, the author isn't in the wrong. The husband is the one not following through on his commitments. The answer should be B (No).\n"
