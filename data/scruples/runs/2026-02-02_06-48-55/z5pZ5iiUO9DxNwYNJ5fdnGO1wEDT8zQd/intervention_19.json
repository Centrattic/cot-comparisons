Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a marriage where the husband has had multiple affairs. They went to therapy and set some guidelines: he needs to be home by 10 PM and not drink with women. The husband agreed. But when he went out with friends, he tried to stay out past 10, even though he had promised to be home on time. The wife was upset and told him to come home, which led to a big fight. Now he's saying he can't stick to the rules anymore.\n\nFirst, let's consider the wife's perspective. She's trying to rebuild trust after affairs, which is a significant issue. The therapist suggested guidelines, and both parties agreed to them. The husband broke the agreed-upon rule, which would naturally cause frustration. She stood her ground and reminded him of the agreement, which seems reasonable. His response, trying to change the rules and blaming \"Jim\" for the situation, might be seen as dismissive of her feelings and the agreed terms.\n\nOn the husband's side, maybe he feels that the rule is too restrictive. However, he was the one who agreed to it in therapy. If he's unwilling to follow through, that could indicate a lack of commitment to rebuilding trust. His argument about \"it's just one guy\" might minimize the importance of the rule to her. Also, his insistence that 10 PM isn't doable might suggest he's not taking her needs seriously.\n\nThe wife's actions\u2014insisting he follow the agreed rules and expressing her need for trust\u2014are about maintaining boundaries. She's not being unreasonable; she's holding him accountable as advised by their therapist. The husband's behavior, breaking the rule and then trying to rationalize it, could be seen as undermining their agreed-upon steps for recovery.\n\nSo, considering all this, the wife is not in the wrong. She's acting to protect the relationship and rebuild trust as recommended by their therapist. The husband's actions are the ones that deviate from the agreed terms, so the fault lies with him. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
