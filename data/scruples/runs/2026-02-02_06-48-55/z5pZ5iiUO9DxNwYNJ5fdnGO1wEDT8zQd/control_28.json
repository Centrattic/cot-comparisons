Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves her husband having multiple affairs, and they've set up guidelines with their therapist. The rule was he should be home by 10 PM. He went out with a guy named Jim, then texted her late, asking to stay out, and they fought. Now he's upset because he came home late and says the 10 PM rule isn't doable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple is in therapy, and the husband agreed to the guidelines to rebuild trust. The author was following the agreed-upon rules. When he broke the agreement, she stood her ground, which is understandable given the history of infidelity. He tried to use \"Jim\" as an excuse and even felt justified in breaking the rule. That could be seen as dismissive of her feelings and the process they're working on.\n\nThe author's anger comes from her husband not respecting the agreed boundaries. She's trying to hold him accountable, which is a key part of rebuilding trust. His argument that \"it's just one guy\" and that women have left suggests he might be minimizing the issue. Also, he's already broken the rule once, so his claim that the rule isn't doable might be his way of avoiding responsibility.\n\nFrom a therapeutic standpoint, consistency is crucial in such cases. If the husband agreed to the rules, he should follow them unless there's a mutual agreement to adjust them. The author isn't being unreasonable; she's enforcing the boundaries they set together. His reaction\u2014arguing, whining, and making excuses\u2014indicates a lack of commitment to the process. The fact that he's only got two weeks left of the agreement might make the situation more urgent, but breaking the rule now could undermine the progress they've made.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not in the wrong. She's acting in accordance with the therapy's guidance and her own need for trust. The husband's behavior is the issue here. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
