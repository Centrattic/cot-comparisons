Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the wife) is in the wrong for telling her husband to come home, given the context of his affairs and the agreed-upon guidelines. \n\nFirst, the husband has had multiple affairs, which is a serious issue in their marriage. The therapist suggested setting guidelines, like being home by 10 PM and not drinking with women. The husband agreed to these terms. However, he broke them by staying out past the agreed time and trying to justify it by saying he was with a guy named Jim, even though he was supposed to avoid drinking with women.\n\nThe wife is upset because he isn't following through on his commitments. She reminds him of the agreement, which was part of a therapeutic plan to rebuild trust. The husband argues, says it's just one guy, and then gets defensive. The wife threatens to leave if he doesn't commit to fixing the marriage. The husband comes home late, claims being home before 11 is good enough, and even says Jim is mad at the wife.\n\nFrom what I can see, the wife is trying to hold her husband accountable as per their agreed terms. The husband is violating the terms he agreed to, which the therapist deemed necessary for rebuilding trust. The wife's anger seems justified because he's not following through on commitments he made. The husband's excuse about Jim doesn't hold up since the rule was about not drinking with women, not about socializing with others. Also, his argument that 10 PM isn't doable now undermines the agreement. The wife is within her rights to be upset and to enforce the terms they set up with their therapist. There's no indication she's being unreasonable; she's trying to maintain the agreed-upon boundaries for trust rebuilding. So, the answer is B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
