Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the husband has had multiple affairs, and they're working with a therapist to rebuild trust. The therapist suggested guidelines, like being home by 10 PM and not drinking with women. The husband agreed to these terms. Then, when he went out with friends, he asked if he could stay out past 10 because only one guy (Jim) was left, and he ended up coming home 45 minutes late. The author is upset because he broke the agreement, argued about it, and even tried to guilt-trip her with Jim being mad.\n\nFirst, the husband agreed to the terms in therapy. Breaking those terms would be a problem, right? The author is trying to hold him accountable, which seems reasonable given the history of affairs. The therapist probably set these boundaries to help rebuild trust, so the husband not following through is a breach. The author's anger makes sense because the husband isn't respecting the agreed-upon rules. Also, using Jim as an excuse and then blaming her for making Jim mad seems manipulative. \n\nBut wait, maybe the husband had a legitimate reason? The author said he was out with guys, and maybe staying past 10 was a social thing. But he had agreed to the 10 PM rule, so even if it's hard, he should stick to it. The fact that he argued and didn't come home until 45 minutes late shows a lack of commitment to the agreement. \n\nThe author's response was to tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, she's going back home. That's a strong statement, but given the circumstances, it's a valid expression of her frustration and desire for him to follow through. She's not the one breaking the rules here. The husband is the one who agreed and then didn't hold up his end. \n\nSo, considering the therapist's advice, the husband's history, and the agreed terms, the author isn't in the wrong. She's trying to rebuild trust by holding him accountable. The husband's actions are the issue here. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
