Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling her husband to come home by 10 PM after he had agreed to follow that guideline to rebuild trust after multiple affairs. \n\nFirst, the husband has a history of infidelity, which is a major issue. The therapist suggested setting boundaries, including the 10 PM curfew and not drinking with women. The husband agreed to these terms. Last night, he went out with friends, assured her he'd be home by 10, but at 9:50, he texts to say he wants to stay out with \"Jim.\" The author insists he follow the agreed time, leading to an argument. He then comes home 45 minutes late, claims he was home before 11 and that the text was sent before 10, and now \"Jim\" is mad at the author. He also says the 10 PM rule isn't doable anymore.\n\nThe author is upset because he broke their agreement, tried to justify it with his friend, and then dismissed her feelings. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. \n\nI need to consider both sides. The husband agreed to the rules but didn't follow them, which undermines trust. The author enforcing the boundary is reasonable, especially after multiple affairs. Setting clear expectations is crucial in such cases. The husband's attempt to make excuses and shift blame might indicate a lack of commitment to the agreed terms. The author's anger is justified given the circumstances. The husband's behavior\u2014arguing, not following the curfew, and dismissing her concerns\u2014suggests he's not taking the necessary steps to rebuild trust. \n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong for standing by the agreement and expressing her frustration. The husband's actions are the issue here.\n"
