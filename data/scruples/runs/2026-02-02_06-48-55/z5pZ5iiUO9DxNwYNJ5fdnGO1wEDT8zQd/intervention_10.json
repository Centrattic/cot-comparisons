Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband with multiple affairs who agreed to certain boundaries in therapy. The wife sets a rule that he must be home by 10 PM for a month, and he breaks that by staying out past the agreed time. The key points here are about trust and accountability.\n\nFirst, the husband agreed to the terms in therapy, which the therapist suggested as a way to rebuild trust. The wife is enforcing the agreement, which seems reasonable. He then texts to ask for an exception, and she reminds him of the importance of sticking to the rules. He argues and doesn't follow through, leading to a fight. The husband later claims he was home before 11, but that's after the agreed time. \n\nThe wife's actions seem to be about maintaining the boundaries necessary for rebuilding trust. She's not just angry about the time but about him breaking his word and trying to use \"Jim\" as an excuse. The husband's refusal to follow through on the agreed-upon terms undermines the trust-building process. \n\nThe user initially thought the author might be in the wrong, but considering the context of agreed-upon rules and the husband's infidelity history, the wife's stance is about holding him accountable. The husband's actions (breaking the agreement, making excuses) are the issue here. So the answer should be B (author not in the wrong).\n"
