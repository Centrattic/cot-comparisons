Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her husband to come home on time as part of a trust-rebuilding agreement. \n\nFirst, the husband has a history of affairs, and they have a therapist who set guidelines, including being home by 10 PM and not drinking with women. The husband agreed to these terms. Then, when he goes out and wants to stay past 10 because he's with a guy named Jim, the author insists he come home. They fight, and the husband breaks the agreement.\n\nSo, the key points are: the guidelines were set by their therapist, the husband agreed to them, and he violated the agreed-upon rules. The author is enforcing the boundaries they both agreed to. The husband is trying to make exceptions and even using the other guy to justify staying out later. \n\nThe author is standing by the agreed terms, which is reasonable, especially given the history of infidelity. The husband breaking the agreement undermines the trust they're trying to rebuild. The author's anger is justified because he went back on his word. The therapist's guidelines are part of the solution to their problem, and the husband's resistance to following them could indicate he's not committed to fixing the marriage. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. She's holding him accountable as advised by their therapist. The husband's actions are the problem here. So the answer should be B.\n"
