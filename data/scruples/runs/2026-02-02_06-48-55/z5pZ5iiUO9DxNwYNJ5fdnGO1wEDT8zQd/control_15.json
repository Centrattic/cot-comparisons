Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a couple working with a therapist because the husband has had multiple affairs. They came up with some guidelines in therapy to rebuild trust: the husband should be home by 10 PM and not drink with women. He agreed to these terms.\n\nThen, the first time he goes out with friends, he's supposed to be home by 10. But at 9:50, he texts the author asking if he can stay out because it's just him and \"Jim\". The author insists he come home on time, but he argues and ends up coming home 45 minutes late. He later says the rules aren't doable and won't follow them anymore, even though they had agreed on a month-long trial.\n\nThe author is upset because he broke his word, tried to use \"Jim\" as an excuse, and didn't follow the agreed-upon rules. She also mentions that this led to a big fight where she threatened to leave if he didn't commit to fixing the marriage.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Well, the husband agreed to the guidelines as part of therapy to rebuild trust. Breaking those rules, especially after agreeing, seems like his fault. He's the one who didn't follow through, and he's trying to justify it by saying it's just one guy and the time isn't doable. The author is holding him accountable, which makes sense because trust is crucial after infidelity. She's not the one who broke the agreement. The husband's actions\u2014coming home late despite the agreement and not taking the rules seriously\u2014seem to be the main issues here. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for being upset and enforcing the rules they set together in therapy.\n"
