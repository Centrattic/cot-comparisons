Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that her husband has had multiple affairs, and they're in therapy working on rebuilding trust. The therapist set up some guidelines: for a month, he needs to be home by 10 and not drink with women. He agreed to this. Then, he goes out with friends and texts her at 9:50 saying he wants to stay out with just \"Jim\" now. She tells him to come home on time to build trust, but he argues, says it's just one guy, and they fight. She threatens to leave, he comes home 45 minutes late, and then he's upset with her for making him come home on time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The affair history is a big deal. Trust is broken, and therapy is part of the process. The guidelines were agreed upon with the therapist's input. So, the husband agreed to these rules. When he breaks them, even if it's a minor thing like staying out a bit late, it's a violation of the agreed-upon terms. The author is holding him accountable, which seems reasonable given the circumstances. She's trying to rebuild trust, which requires consistency and following through on commitments. \n\nHe argues that it's just one guy and that he shouldn't have to follow the rules, but that's undermining the agreement they made. The fact that he's late and then blames her for making him come home shows a lack of accountability on his part. She's not being unreasonable by expecting him to stick to the agreed time. Also, using \"Jim\" as an excuse to stay out might be a way to avoid responsibility. \n\nThe author's anger is justified because he broke his word, which is crucial in rebuilding trust after infidelity. She's not being demanding; she's enforcing a boundary necessary for her healing. His reaction\u2014being late and then blaming her\u2014indicates a lack of willingness to take responsibility. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. She's acting in a way that's necessary for the therapy's guidelines and her own trust-building process. The husband is the one who's not following through, making the argument about him. Therefore, the answer should be B, No.\n"
