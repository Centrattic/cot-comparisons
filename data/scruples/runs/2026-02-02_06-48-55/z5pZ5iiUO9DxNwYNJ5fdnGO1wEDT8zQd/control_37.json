Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a wife who's dealing with her husband's infidelity. They have a therapist and set some boundaries, like the husband coming home by 10 PM and not drinking with women. He agreed to these terms. Then, when he goes out and breaks the agreement by staying out past 10, even though he had promised to follow it, the wife is upset and confronts him.\n\nFirst, the husband had multiple affairs, which is a big deal. The therapist suggested accountability and guidelines to rebuild trust. The wife and husband agreed on these rules, and he initially said it was okay. So, when he breaks the rule, the wife is justified in being angry. He's not following through on his commitment, which is about trust. \n\nHe tried to use the excuse that it was just one guy left, Jim, and that the women had already left, so he could stay out. But he had agreed not to drink with women, and even if women were gone, he was still out past the agreed time. The wife is standing by the rules they set together, which were part of a plan to fix their marriage. The husband's argument seems like making excuses and not taking responsibility. \n\nAlso, when the wife threatens to leave if he doesn't fix things, he comes home late anyway and then blames her for making Jim mad. That's not taking accountability. He even says the 10 PM rule isn't doable anymore, which undermines the agreement they made. \n\nThe wife is trying to hold him to the standards they agreed on, especially after his infidelity. She's not being unreasonable here; trust is broken, and following through is crucial. The husband's behavior is the issue here, not her standing her ground. So, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
