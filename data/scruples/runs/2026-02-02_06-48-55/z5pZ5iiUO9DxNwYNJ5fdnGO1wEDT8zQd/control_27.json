Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a husband with multiple affairs, and they've set up guidelines with their therapist, including being home by 10 PM and not drinking with women. The husband breaks the agreement by staying out past 10, using a friend \"Jim\" as an excuse, and then argues that the rule isn't doable. The author confronts him and threatens to leave if he doesn't want to fix the marriage.\n\nFirst, the therapist's guidelines are part of a structured plan to rebuild trust. The husband agreed to these terms, so breaking them undermines the process. The author is following the plan they both agreed on, which shows she's trying to rebuild trust. The husband's argument about \"just one guy\" and the women already leaving doesn't justify breaking the agreement, especially since he had agreed not to drink with women. The fact that he came home 45 minutes late and then blamed \"Jim\" adds to the frustration. His refusal to stick to the agreed-upon rules suggests he's not taking the necessary steps to rebuild trust, which the author has a right to be upset about.\n\nThe author's anger stems from a place of needing trust and accountability, which are crucial after infidelity. She's not being unreasonable by holding him to the standards they set with their therapist. The husband's behavior here is the issue\u2014he's not following through on his commitments. The author isn't wrong for standing her ground and expressing her hurt when her husband violates their agreement. So, the answer should be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
