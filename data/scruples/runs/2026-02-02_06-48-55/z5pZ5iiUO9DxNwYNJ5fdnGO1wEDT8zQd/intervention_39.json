Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband with multiple affairs, and they've set up guidelines with their therapist to rebuild trust. The main issue here is the husband breaking the agreed-upon rules by staying out past 10 PM with a guy named Jim, and then making excuses.\n\nFirst, the author of the post (the wife) set boundaries with the help of a therapist. The husband agreed to come home by 10 and not drink with women. He broke that agreement by staying out past the time, even though he had previously said it was fine. He then tried to justify it by saying it's only one guy, and that the women had already left. The wife stood her ground, reminded him of the trust issues, and even threatened to leave the marriage if he wasn't committed. The husband ended up coming home late and argued that 10 PM wasn't doable anymore.\n\nI need to consider if the wife was being unreasonable. She had a legitimate reason to be concerned given the affair history. Setting boundaries is crucial in such cases for rebuilding trust. The husband didn't stick to the agreement, which shows a lack of commitment. The wife's anger and insistence on him following the rules make sense because breaking those rules undermines the therapy's purpose. The husband's excuses and guilt-tripping about Jim don't justify his actions. \n\nSo, the wife isn't in the wrong here. The husband is the one who violated the agreed terms and is not taking the necessary steps to rebuild trust. The wife's actions are reasonable given the circumstances. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
