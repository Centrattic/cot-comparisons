Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The context is that the husband had multiple affairs, and they agreed in therapy on some guidelines to rebuild trust. The specific rule was he should be home by 10 PM and not drink with women. He went out with friends, assured her he'd be home on time, but then at 9:50 he asked if he could stay out because it's just him and Jim. The author insists he come home, they fight, and he ends up coming in 45 minutes late, then argues that he was home before 11 and that Jim is now mad. The author is upset that he broke the agreement and used Jim to guilt-trip her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The husband has a history of infidelity, so trust is a big issue here. The guidelines were set in therapy, which is a professional setting, so breaking them could be seen as not taking the process seriously. The author is following through on the agreed-upon rules, which seems reasonable. The husband, on the other hand, is not adhering to the rules he himself agreed to, which is a problem. He's also trying to justify the late return by saying he was home before 11, but the rule was about the time, not just the final arrival. Using a friend (Jim) to get out of the commitment might be manipulation, which the author is right to be angry about.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but after reading the details, I think the opposite. The author is trying to rebuild trust by holding the husband accountable. The husband's actions are undermining the process. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong. The main issue is the husband breaking the agreed rules, not the author being too strict. The guidelines were part of a therapeutic process, so the author's insistence on following them is valid. The husband's attempt to shift responsibility to Jim and his refusal to comply moving forward shows a lack of commitment, which the author is justified in reacting to.\n"
