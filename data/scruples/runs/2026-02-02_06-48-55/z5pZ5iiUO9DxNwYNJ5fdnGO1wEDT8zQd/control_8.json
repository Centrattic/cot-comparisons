Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The scenario involves a husband who has had multiple affairs and a wife who set boundaries with their therapist. The agreed-upon rules were that the husband should be home by 10 and not drink with women. He broke the first rule by staying out past 10, argued about it, and then the wife threatened to leave if he didn't commit to fixing the marriage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The husband has a history of infidelity, which is a serious issue. The couple was in therapy and set specific guidelines to rebuild trust. The wife is holding him accountable as part of that process. When he breaks the agreed-upon rule, she's upset because trust has been broken before. His response seems dismissive\u2014he made excuses, tried to guilt-trip her with \"Jim\" being mad, and dismissed the importance of the rule. \n\nThe key points here are accountability and trust. The wife is trying to rebuild trust through agreed boundaries. The husband breaking those boundaries and not taking it seriously could indicate he's not committed to the process. The wife's anger seems justified given the background. She's within her right to be upset and to hold him to his commitments. \n\nThe husband's argument that \"10 isn't doable\" might be a way to avoid responsibility. The rule was set for a month, and he's only halfway through. If he's already struggling with the terms, maybe they need to revisit the agreement, but that's a discussion to have in therapy. The wife's reaction\u2014telling him she'll leave if he's not committed\u2014is a valid expression of her feelings, especially after repeated betrayals.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. She's taking steps to rebuild trust as advised by the therapist. The husband's actions are the problem here. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
