Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband who agreed to certain guidelines after infidelity to rebuild trust. The guidelines included being home by 10 PM and not drinking with women. The husband went out with friends, broke the curfew, and then argued with his wife, leading to a fight where she threatened to leave. The husband later dismissed her concerns and claims the rules aren't doable anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of their situation. They were in therapy, and the guidelines were agreed upon as part of trust-building. The husband initially agreed to the terms but then broke them. The wife is holding him accountable, which seems justified given the history of affairs. \n\nThe husband's actions included not only breaking the curfew but also trying to justify it by mentioning his friend \"Jim,\" which might be an attempt to shift blame or guilt-trip her. The wife's response\u2014telling him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, she'll leave\u2014could be seen as a strong statement, but in the context of a troubled marriage, it might be a legitimate expression of her limits.\n\nNow, the user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion. I need to assess if the wife overstepped. The key points are: agreed-upon rules, the husband's breach of those rules, and the wife's reaction. The wife was clear about the agreement and her need for trust. The husband's failure to follow through and his dismissive attitude post-confrontation seem to indicate a lack of commitment to the agreed-upon process.\n\nThe husband's argument about the rules not being doable anymore after only 2 weeks might be an excuse to avoid accountability. The wife's anger is a response to him breaking his word, which is a valid concern, especially in the context of rebuilding trust after infidelity. \n\nConsidering these points, the wife is not in the wrong for holding him to the agreed terms. Her reaction is a reasonable response to his breach of trust and the lack of commitment to the process. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
