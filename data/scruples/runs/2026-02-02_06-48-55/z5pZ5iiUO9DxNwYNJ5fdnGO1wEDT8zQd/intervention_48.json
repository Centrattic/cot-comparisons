Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after telling her husband to come home by 10 PM as part of a therapy agreement. The husband had multiple affairs and agreed to the guidelines. However, he broke the agreement by staying out later, argued about it, and even brought up a friend named Jim to justify his actions.\n\nFirst, the couple had a therapist's guidance to set boundaries to rebuild trust. The husband agreed to the rules, so breaking them undermines the agreement. The author stood her ground, which is understandable given the history of infidelity. Her anger stems from his dishonesty and lack of accountability. \n\nThe husband's response seems dismissive. He didn't follow the agreed-upon time, made excuses, and even tried to shift blame to Jim. His behavior could be seen as not taking the necessary steps to rebuild trust, which is crucial after affairs. The author's reaction\u2014insisting on the agreement and expressing her hurt\u2014is a valid response to his actions.\n\nConsidering the context, the author isn't being unrealistic. She's enforcing the boundaries that were set with professional guidance. The husband's resistance might indicate he's not fully committed to the therapy's recommendations, which could jeopardize the marriage. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. She's asserting the agreed-upon rules to protect the relationship. The husband's actions and attitude are problematic here, not hers. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
