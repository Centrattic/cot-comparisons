Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the author (the person writing the situation) is in the wrong.\n\nSo, the situation is about a wife whose husband has had multiple affairs. They went to therapy and set some guidelines, like being home by 10 and not drinking with women. The husband agreed. Then he went out with friends and broke the agreement by staying out past 10 and trying to justify it by saying there's just one guy left, Jim. The wife got angry, told him to come home, and they fought. The husband came home late and now is saying the 10 PM rule isn't doable anymore.\n\nThe user thinks the author might be in the wrong but is unsure. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the guidelines were set with the therapist, so they're part of the agreed-upon steps to rebuild trust. The husband agreed to them. Breaking those terms would naturally cause frustration. The wife is enforcing the agreement, which he agreed to, so she's holding him accountable. That seems justified.\n\nHe's trying to use exceptions (Jim) and then later says the rule isn't doable. But since the rule is part of the agreement to rebuild trust, he should either follow it or not agree to it in the first place. Her being upset about him breaking the agreement isn't unreasonable. Trust is hard to rebuild, especially after multiple affairs. She's trying to maintain the terms they set together.\n\nHe's also trying to shift blame by saying Jim is mad at her. That's a manipulation tactic. She's standing her ground, which is reasonable. The therapist probably emphasized accountability, so her pushing for him to follow through makes sense.\n\nSo, considering all that, the wife isn't in the wrong. She's trying to rebuild trust by holding him to the agreed terms. The husband is the one not following through. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
