Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband with multiple affairs, and the couple's therapist set guidelines for him to follow to rebuild trust. The specific rule here was that he should be home by 10 PM. He went out with friends, assured his wife he'd be back on time, but then texted her to ask if he could stay out when only one friend was left. The wife insists he come home on time, leading to a fight where she threatens to leave if he doesn't commit to fixing the marriage. He comes home over an hour late and dismisses her concerns.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of their therapy. The therapist set boundaries for him to rebuild trust, which he agreed to. Breaking that rule seems like a red flag. The wife is holding him accountable, which is reasonable given his past infidelity. He's not only breaking the agreed-upon rules but also trying to justify it by saying \"it's just one guy\" and that he's done drinking. His argument might be about flexibility, but the key here is trust. The wife's need for him to follow through is about rebuilding that trust, which he's undermining by not adhering to the agreed-upon terms.\n\nHe also brings up \"Jim\" as a reason to guilt-trip her, which is manipulative. The wife is right to be upset about that. His refusal to follow the set guidelines going forward, especially with the remaining two weeks, shows a lack of commitment to the process. The therapist's guidelines were a structured approach for both parties to work on the marriage, and he's resisting them.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the rule of being home by 10 is too rigid? But given the infidelity history, strict rules are necessary for rebuilding trust. The husband's actions (not following through, making excuses) are problematic. The wife's anger and insistence on accountability seem justified. She's not being unreasonable; she's enforcing the boundaries set by their therapist. The husband's behavior is the issue here, not the wife's response. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
