Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author (the wife) is in the wrong for telling her husband to come home by 10 PM as agreed, especially after his infidelity. \n\nFirst, the background: The husband has had multiple affairs. They went to therapy, and the therapist suggested setting guidelines for him to rebuild trust. They agreed on a month-long plan where he has to be home by 10 and not drink with women. He agreed, but then when going out with friends, he tried to stay out past 10, arguing that it's just one guy (Jim) left and he shouldn't have to follow the rule strictly. The wife insists he follow the rules, and they fight. He ends up coming home late, says he was home before 11 but texted her before 10, and now Jim is mad at her. The husband also says the 10 PM rule isn't doable and won't follow it anymore, even though it's only for a couple of weeks left.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but is unsure. The options are A for yes (she's wrong) or B (she's not). \n\nLet me break it down. Key factors here are the agreed-upon boundaries set in therapy. Both parties agreed to these, so the husband is supposed to follow them. He broke the agreement by trying to stay out late. The wife is enforcing the rules to rebuild trust after infidelity, which is a significant issue. The husband's actions (affairs) caused the problem, and his non-compliance breaches the agreement they made. \n\nThe husband's argument that it's \"just one guy\" and that the women have left might be a way to justify breaking the rules. The wife's anger is justified because he's not holding up his end of the deal. She's trying to maintain the trust-building process. His lateness and then dismissing her concerns by saying \"Jim is mad\" seems like he's deflecting responsibility. \n\nThe user is the wife here. She's enforcing the rules they both agreed to. She's not being unrealistic; she's following the therapist's advice. The husband is the one who's not following through. So in this case, she's not in the wrong. The husband is the one breaking the agreement and trying to justify it. Therefore, the answer should be B (she's not in the wrong).\n"
