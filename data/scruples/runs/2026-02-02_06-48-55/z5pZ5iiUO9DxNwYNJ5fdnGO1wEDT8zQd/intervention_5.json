Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The question is whether the author (the wife) is in the wrong for telling her husband to come home by 10 PM as part of their agreement to rebuild trust after his affairs.\n\nFirst, the husband has had multiple affairs. Their therapist advised setting guidelines, including the husband coming home by 10 PM and not drinking with women. He agreed to these terms initially. When he went out with friends, he was supposed to be back by 10. He tried to negotiate staying out past that with just one friend, \"Jim,\" arguing that the rules were too strict now. The wife stood her ground, emphasizing the importance of trust. They had a big fight, and he came home late, then dismissed her concerns, saying the time wasn't \"doable.\"\n\nThe user thinks the wife is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. The wife's actions stem from needing trust and following the therapist's advice. She's setting boundaries to rebuild the relationship. The husband, on the other hand, broke his agreement, tried to justify it by saying others left, and then refused to follow the rule anymore. His behavior undermines the agreement and the trust-building process. His response seems dismissive and maybe resistant to accountability. \n\nIn such situations, the person who's been wronged (the wife) has the right to enforce agreements made in therapy to protect her own emotional well-being and rebuild trust. The husband's actions (cheating, breaking agreements, being defensive) suggest he's not fully committed to repairing the relationship. The wife isn't being unreasonable by holding him to the terms they both agreed on. She's acting in her own best interest and following professional advice. So, the husband's actions are problematic, and the wife isn't in the wrong for enforcing the boundaries.\n"
