Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her husband to come home by 10 PM as part of their agreed-upon guidelines to rebuild trust after his affairs. \n\nFirst, the context is important. The husband has had multiple affairs, and they've set up these rules with their therapist. The husband agreed to the guidelines, including being home by 10 and not drinking with women. He went out with friends, asked to stay out later, and then broke the agreed time. The author stood her ground, leading to a fight where she threatened to leave if he didn't commit.\n\nThe key points here are about trust and accountability. After infidelity, trust is shattered, and setting boundaries is crucial. The husband agreed to these rules, so when he breaks them, it's a breach of trust. The author's anger is justified because he's not following through on his commitments, which he had previously agreed to. The fact that he tried to use \"Jim\" as an excuse and dismissed her feelings by saying the time isn't doable shows a lack of respect for her needs and the therapeutic agreement.\n\nThe therapist's role here is also a factor. They were involved in creating the guidelines, so the husband's non-compliance might indicate resistance to the process. The author's insistence on adherence isn't being unrealistic; it's about maintaining the integrity of the agreed-upon steps to rebuild the relationship. The husband's reaction\u2014arguing, whining, and then dismissing the issue after being late\u2014shows a lack of accountability, which is a red flag in recovery from infidelity.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is not in the wrong. She's trying to hold her husband accountable as agreed, which is necessary for trust rebuilding. His actions and reactions are the problem here, not hers.\n"
