Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple dealing with the husband's affairs. They have a therapist who set up guidelines, including being home by 10 PM and not drinking with women. The husband agreed to these terms. \n\nSo, when the husband goes out with his friend Jim and texts to stay out past 10, the author is upset. She reminds him of the agreement made during therapy, which he had agreed to. He argues, and they fight, leading her to threaten leaving if he doesn't fix the marriage. He comes home late, and then claims he was home before 11 and that the author is making Jim angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The husband has a history of affairs, so trust is a big issue. The guidelines were set in therapy, which suggests that both parties agreed to these terms. The husband agreed to come home by 10, but he broke that agreement. The author is trying to hold him accountable, which is part of the therapist's plan to rebuild trust. \n\nIs the author being unrealistic? The agreed time is 10 PM. If he agreed to that, then not following through is his issue. The fact that he's with a friend and wants to stay late might be a personal choice, but breaking the agreed rule is a problem. The author's anger is justified because he's not respecting the boundaries they set together. \n\nHe also made an excuse that \"it's just one guy\" and then tried to use Jim as a reason to make her feel guilty. That manipulation is problematic. The author is standing her ground, which is necessary in this context. The husband's behavior of not following through on agreements could hinder rebuilding trust. \n\nThe key points here are the agreed-upon rules, the husband breaking them, and the author holding him accountable. The author's actions are in line with the therapist's advice. So, she's not in the wrong. The husband is the one who's not adhering to the agreed terms and is being defensive and manipulative. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
