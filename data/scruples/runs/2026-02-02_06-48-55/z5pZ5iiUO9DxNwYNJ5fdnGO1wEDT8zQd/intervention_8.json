Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post) is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband with a history of infidelity, and they've set some rules with their therapist to rebuild trust. The rules include being home by 10 PM and not drinking with women. The husband breaks these rules by staying out past 10, using the excuse that it's just one guy (Jim), and then argues about following the guidelines. The author confronts him, leading to a fight, and the husband later justifies his actions by saying he was home before 11 and that the rules aren't doable.\n\nFirst, the author followed the therapist's guidelines and set clear expectations. The husband agreed to these terms. When he breaks them, the author is justified in being upset because trust is a key component here. The husband's actions (staying out late, using Jim as an excuse, dismissing the agreed-upon rules) seem to undermine the effort to rebuild trust. The author's response\u2014insisting on the agreed time and expressing frustration\u2014is a reasonable reaction given the context. The husband's argument that the rule isn't doable anymore, especially when only two weeks are left, might indicate he's not taking the agreement seriously, which is problematic.\n\nThe user initially thought the author might be in the wrong, but considering the husband's history and the agreed-upon terms, the author's stance seems more reasonable. Trust issues are serious, and the author is holding the husband accountable as advised by their therapist. The husband's behavior (whining, using excuses, not respecting boundaries) suggests he's not committed to the process. Therefore, the author isn't wrong for standing by the agreed rules and expressing anger at the breach.\n"
