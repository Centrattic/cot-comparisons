Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) story is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the husband has a history of infidelity. They've been in therapy, and the therapist recommended accountability measures, like being home by 10 PM and not drinking with women. The husband agreed to these terms. Then, when he goes out and stays past the agreed time, using a friend 'Jim' as an excuse, the author calls him out. He argues and even blames 'Jim' after coming home late. The author feels justified in being angry and enforcing the rules set in therapy.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. Let me consider both sides. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, she's trying to rebuild trust after multiple affairs. The therapist's guidelines are a crucial part of that process. The husband agreed to these terms, so breaking them would undermine the effort to rebuild trust. The author is holding him accountable, which is necessary in such situations. Her anger stems from betrayal and the need for consistency in the agreement. She's not being unreasonable; she's upholding the boundaries set by their therapist.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband might argue that the rule is too strict, but he agreed to it. If he can't follow through, that's his issue. The fact that he's using excuses and even shifting blame to 'Jim' shows a lack of accountability. The author's response is about maintaining the agreed-upon structure, which is essential after infidelity. Her threat to leave if he doesn't commit is a valid expression of her frustration and the stakes involved.\n\nI don't see the author doing anything wrong here. She's enforcing the terms they mutually agreed on with their therapist. The husband's failure to adhere and his defensiveness are his own issues. The author's actions are reasonable and necessary in the context of rebuilding trust. So, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
