Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband with multiple affairs. They've agreed with their therapist on some guidelines, like being home by 10 and not drinking with women. The husband goes out with friends, says he can't come home on time because he's with a guy now, and argues about the rules. The wife is upset, tells him if he doesn't fix the marriage, she's leaving. He comes home late, then complains about the time and says the rule isn't doable.\n\nThe user thinks the author (the wife) is in the wrong. I need to decide between A and B. \n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The couple set up rules in therapy to rebuild trust. The husband agreed to them. He then broke the agreement by staying out past 10 with \"Jim,\" even after promising to follow the guidelines. The wife is enforcing the rules, which were part of a mutual agreement. The husband is not following through and is making excuses. The therapist's role was to help them create a plan, and the husband's non-compliance might undermine that process.\n\nThe wife's actions\u2014stating the rule and its importance for trust, getting angry when he breaks it, and threatening to leave if he doesn't commit\u2014are reactions to a broken agreement. She's trying to hold him accountable, which aligns with the therapist's advice. The husband's argument that \"it's just one guy\" and that the time isn't doable might be him deflecting responsibility. Also, using \"Jim\" to feel guilty seems like manipulation, which is not helpful for trust rebuilding.\n\nThe user thinks the wife is in the wrong, but considering the situation, her stance seems justified. She's upholding a previously agreed-upon boundary. The husband's infidelity and subsequent non-compliance are the root issues here. The wife's anger is a response to broken trust and the husband's unwillingness to follow through on his commitments. Therefore, the wife isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
