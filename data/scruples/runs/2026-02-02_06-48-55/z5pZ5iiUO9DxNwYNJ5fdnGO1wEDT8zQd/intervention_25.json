Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in her situation. The main issue is about her husband breaking their agreed-upon rules set by their therapist to rebuild trust after his affairs.\n\nFirst, the therapist suggested guidelines: being home by 10 and not drinking with women. The husband agreed to these. Then, he went out and asked to stay out past 10 with another guy, Jim. The author asked him to come home, leading to a fight. The husband didn't follow through and dismissed her concerns, even blaming the situation on Jim.\n\nThe author's side: She's trying to enforce the agreed rules to rebuild trust. She's upset because he's breaking the rules and not taking the agreement seriously. Her argument is about him not honoring his commitment, which is crucial after cheating.\n\nHusband's side: He's resistant to the rules, maybe feeling they're too restrictive. He argues that one instance isn't a big deal, and that the rules are unrealistic for him. He's pushing back against what he perceives as control.\n\nNow, considering trust issues after affairs, consistency and accountability are key. The author is trying to set boundaries, which is reasonable. The husband's actions (breaking the agreement, dismissing her feelings) show a lack of commitment to the therapist's plan. The author isn't being unreasonable; she's following professional advice. The husband's behavior is the problem here. He's not holding up his end, which is the core issue.\n\nAlso, the husband's response about Jim being mad seems like a guilt-trip, which is a manipulative tactic. The author's anger is justified because his actions undermine the trust-building process.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. She's upholding the agreed terms, and the husband is the one not following through. Answer B.\n"
