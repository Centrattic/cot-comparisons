Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband with multiple affairs, and they've set guidelines with their therapist, including being home by 10 PM and not drinking with women. The husband breaks the 10 PM rule by staying out past that time after going out with a friend named Jim, even though he had agreed to the terms. The author is upset, tells him he needs to come home, and there's a big fight. The husband argues that 10 PM isn't doable anymore and that the rule was too strict. The author is wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The husband has a history of infidelity, which is a significant issue. The couple worked with a therapist to establish trust-building measures, which the husband agreed to. Breaking those agreements, even if it's about being home on time, might be seen as a breach of trust. The author is trying to hold him accountable as part of rebuilding the marriage, which the therapist suggested. \n\nThe husband's actions\u2014staying out past the agreed time and arguing that the rule isn't feasible\u2014could be seen as not taking the guidelines seriously. Also, using his friend Jim as an excuse might be a way to avoid responsibility. The author is frustrated because this undermines the effort to rebuild trust. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband might feel that the rules are too restrictive, but he had agreed to them. The author's insistence could be seen as reasonable given the circumstances. The husband's reaction to the fight and his dismissive attitude (\"it's just one guy\") might indicate a lack of effort to address the author's concerns. \n\nI need to weigh the importance of accountability in the context of rebuilding trust after infidelity. The author is trying to enforce agreed-upon boundaries, which is a valid step. The husband's non-compliance and defensiveness could be the real issue here. The author's anger is justified because the husband broke the agreement, which is crucial in such situations. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. The husband's actions and attitude are the problems here. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
