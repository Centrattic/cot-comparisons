Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong in their situation. The question is between options A and B.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's husband has had multiple affairs. They set up guidelines with their therapist, including him being home by 10 PM and not drinking with women. He agreed to these terms. Then, when he goes out and breaks the agreement by staying out past 10, the author confronts him. He argues, and they fight. The husband then says the rules aren't doable and won't follow them anymore.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the husband has a history of infidelity, agreed to specific terms in therapy, and broke them. The author is upset because he's not following through, which is crucial for rebuilding trust. The husband is defensive and dismissive of her feelings.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The husband agreed to the guidelines, so when he breaks them, the author is justified in her anger. The author is trying to hold him accountable, which the therapist previously recommended. His breaking the agreement and then being confrontational is a problem. The author isn't being unreasonable; she's enforcing the boundaries necessary for trust. The husband's behavior, including using \"Jim\" to try to guilt-trip her, is manipulative. So, the author's response is appropriate. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
