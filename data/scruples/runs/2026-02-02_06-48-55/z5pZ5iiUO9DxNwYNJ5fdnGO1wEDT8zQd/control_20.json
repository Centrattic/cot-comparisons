Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a husband who has had multiple affairs, and they've set up guidelines with a therapist to rebuild trust. The specific issue is about the husband staying out past the agreed time of 10 PM.\n\nFirst, the couple had a contract with their therapist: the husband agreed to be home by 10 and not drink with women. He went out for the first time, and when he's running late, he asks to stay out. The author tells him that following the agreement is important for rebuilding trust. He argues, they fight, and he eventually comes home 45 minutes late, then dismisses the agreement. The husband now says 10 PM isn't doable and won't follow it anymore.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the agreed-upon boundaries as part of a therapeutic process to rebuild trust. The husband agreed to these terms, so breaking them undermines the process. The author is holding him accountable, which is necessary when trust is broken. The husband's actions (cheating, breaking the agreement) are the main issues. The author's response\u2014insisting on the agreed terms and expressing anger\u2014is a reasonable reaction to broken trust. The husband's defensiveness and dismissal indicate he's not taking the process seriously, which is his fault. The author isn't being unrealistic; she's trying to follow the therapist's advice. The husband's behavior is the problem here. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
