Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the wife is in the wrong for telling her husband to come home as per their agreed guidelines after his affairs. The husband agreed to the terms but then broke them, arguing that it's just one guy and that he's been drinking, even though he shouldn't. The wife got angry and said she'd go back to her family if he didn't want to fix the marriage. The husband came home late, claimed he was home before 11, and now is using 'Jim' to make her feel guilty. The question is whether she's right or wrong.\n\nFirst, the husband had multiple affairs, so there's a history of infidelity. The therapist set guidelines to rebuild trust, which the husband agreed to. He promised to be home by 10 and not drink with women. Then he broke that promise by staying out past 10 and drinking when he shouldn't. The wife reminded him of the agreement, which is understandable because trust is broken. He argued, which might be a deflection tactic. She told him she'd leave if he didn't commit, which is a significant statement but shows how serious the issue is for her.\n\nThe key points here are: 1. The husband violated agreed terms. 2. He's not holding up his end, which is crucial for rebuilding trust. 3. He's using a friend as an excuse and making her feel guilty, which is likely manipulation. \n\nIs the wife wrong for enforcing the rules? Probably not. After infidelity, setting boundaries is important. The husband's actions suggest he's not willing to account for his behavior, which could indicate he's not committed to the relationship. The wife being angry is justified because he broke his word. She's trying to maintain the integrity of their agreement, which the therapist recommended. \n\nHe claims the 10 PM rule isn't doable, but if he agreed to it, then breaking it undermines the process. The guilt-tripping about 'Jim' is a red flag. The wife's reaction is about feeling disrespected and not being taken seriously. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. She's within her rights to be upset and hold him accountable. The husband's behavior is the problem here, not her enforcement of the agreed terms.\n"
