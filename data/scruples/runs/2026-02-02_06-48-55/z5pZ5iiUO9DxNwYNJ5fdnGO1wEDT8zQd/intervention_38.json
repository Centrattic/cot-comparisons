Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (the wife) is in the wrong after setting a rule for her husband to be home by 10 PM to rebuild trust after his affairs. The husband went out with friends and wanted to stay out later, arguing that the rules were too strict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple is working with a therapist to rebuild trust after infidelity. The therapist suggested guidelines, including the 10 PM curfew and no drinking with women. The husband agreed to these terms. When he tried to break the agreement, the wife stood her ground, leading to a fight. He then accused her of making others angry and said the rule wasn't doable anymore.\n\nThe wife's actions seem to be about enforcing the agreed-upon boundaries. She's trying to create structure to rebuild trust, which is a common recommendation in therapy after infidelity. The husband, on the other hand, is breaking the agreed terms and trying to justify it, which could undermine the trust-building process. \n\nIs she being unrealistic? Maybe not. If the therapist recommended these guidelines, following them isn't unreasonable. The husband agreed initially but is now backtracking. The wife's anger is justified because he violated the agreement. The husband's argument about \"Jim\" being mad might be a way to shift blame.\n\nSo, the key points are: 1) Agreed-upon rules from therapy, 2) Husband broke them, 3) Wife enforced the rules. It seems like the husband is the one in the wrong for not respecting the agreement. The wife is trying to maintain the boundaries necessary for healing. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
