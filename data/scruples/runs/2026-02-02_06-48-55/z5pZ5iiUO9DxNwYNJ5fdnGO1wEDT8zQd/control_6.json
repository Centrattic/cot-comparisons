Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (who is a wife) is in the wrong after telling her husband to come home as per their agreed guidelines. The husband had multiple affairs, and they set up rules with their therapist: he needs to be home by 10 PM and avoid drinking with women. He agreed to these terms.\n\nIn the situation, the husband went out with friends, agreed to be home by 10, but then at 9:50, he texts saying he wants to stay out with just one friend, Jim. The wife insists he come home on time to rebuild trust, but he argues and they fight. He comes home 45 minutes late, claims he was home before 11, and now Jim is mad. The wife is upset because he broke the agreement and tried to guilt-trip her with Jim.\n\nFirst, the husband agreed to the rules. Breaking them undermines the trust-building process. The wife is enforcing the agreement they made with their therapist. She's not being unreasonable by holding him accountable. His argument that \"it's just one guy\" doesn't negate the agreed-upon boundaries. Also, he's using the fact that he texted before 10 as an excuse, but being home by 10 was the agreement. The fact that Jim is now mad adds to the problem of him involving others, which might be another breach if he was with other women, but the main issue is breaking the agreed time.\n\nThe wife's anger is justified because the husband didn't follow through on his commitment. The therapist's guidelines are part of his accountability, and deviating from them without discussion shows disrespect for the process. The husband's whining and refusal to stick to the rules suggest he's not serious about rebuilding trust. The wife's insistence on him adhering to the terms isn't being unrealistic; it's necessary for his accountability. So, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
