Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the husband had multiple affairs, and they went to therapy where they set up some guidelines. The agreed-upon rule was he should be home by 10 PM and not drink with women. The husband went out with friends, including someone named Jim, and wanted to stay out past 10. The author asked him to come home, they fought, and he ended up coming home late, then argued about the rules.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is trying to rebuild trust after affairs, which is a serious issue. The therapist suggested setting boundaries, so she's following that advice. She had a clear agreement with her husband, and he broke it. He then tried to use his friend Jim as an excuse and even said that Jim is now mad at her. That sounds like manipulation, maybe gaslighting.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband might feel that the rules are too strict. Maybe he's trying to maintain some social life, which is important for his well-being. But he agreed to the terms initially. Breaking them after agreeing could show a lack of commitment to rebuilding trust. Also, he didn't stick to the agreed time, which was a key part of the plan from therapy.\n\nThe author's anger seems justified because he broke his word, which is crucial after infidelity. Trust is hard to rebuild, and such actions can set back the progress. The husband's argument about not being able to follow the rules anymore might indicate he's not taking the necessary steps to fix the marriage, which is a big red flag.\n\nSo, considering the therapist's advice, the agreement they made, and the husband's actions, the author is not in the wrong. She's trying to hold him accountable, which is necessary for their relationship's health. The husband's behavior here is more problematic. Therefore, the answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
