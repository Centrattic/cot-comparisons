Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in the given situation. The scenario involves a married couple where the husband has had multiple affairs. They've set guidelines with their therapist: he needs to be home by 10 PM and not drink with women. The husband goes out with friends, promises to be home on time, but then texts to stay out because it's just him and a friend named Jim. The author insists he come home on time, leading to a fight. The husband ends up coming home late, argues that 10 PM isn't doable anymore, and blames the author for making Jim mad.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author overstepped. The guidelines were part of a therapeutic agreement to rebuild trust. The author is holding the husband accountable, which is a valid step given his history. The husband broke the agreed-upon rule, which is a breach of trust. The author's frustration and anger are understandable considering the context. The husband's attempt to use Jim as an excuse and shift blame seems manipulative. The author's demand for him to follow the agreement isn't unreasonable; in fact, it's necessary for trust-building. The husband's response of refusing to follow the guidelines undermines the process. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
