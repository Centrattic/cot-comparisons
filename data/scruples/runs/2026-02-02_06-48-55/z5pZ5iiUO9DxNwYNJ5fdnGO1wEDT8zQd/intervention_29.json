Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the husband having multiple affairs, and they set up guidelines with their therapist. The main rule was he should be home by 10 PM. He went out with friends, texted to stay out until later, and then came home late. The author got angry and told him to come home or she'd leave, leading to a fight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The husband has a history of infidelity, and the couple had agreed on boundaries to rebuild trust. The author is following the therapist's advice by setting clear expectations. The husband agreed to these terms but then broke them, which is a breach of their agreement. The author's reaction is about enforcing the agreed-upon rules to regain trust.\n\nThe husband tried to justify staying out by saying it's not a big deal and even blamed \"Jim\" for the conflict. That seems like he's not taking responsibility for his actions. The author is frustrated because he's breaking the rules and isn't holding up his end of the bargain. She's also standing up for her needs by threatening to go back to her family if he doesn't commit to fixing the relationship.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, the author isn't being unreasonable. She's sticking to the boundaries they established. The husband, on the other hand, is violating those boundaries and not taking her feelings into account. His behavior undermines the effort to rebuild trust. The author's anger is justified because he's not following through on his commitments, which is a key part of the therapy process.\n\nSome might argue that being home by 10 is too strict, but given the history of affairs, strict boundaries are necessary. The husband's refusal to comply and his dismissive attitude (\"it's just one guy\") show a lack of respect for her needs. The author is within her rights to demand accountability. So, I think the husband is in the wrong here, not the author. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
