Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband with a history of infidelity, and they're working with a therapist to rebuild trust. The couple agreed on specific rules: he must be home by 10 PM and avoid drinking with women. He broke the curfew, tried to negotiate staying out longer, and later dismissed the agreement.\n\nFirst, the therapist's role is crucial here. The guidelines were set collaboratively with professional guidance, so the husband agreed to them. The author is holding him accountable, which is part of the therapeutic process. His breaking the curfew and then arguing about it undermines the trust-building effort. \n\nThe husband's excuses\u2014like \"it's just one guy\" and claiming he was home before 11\u2014seem dismissive. The author is frustrated because he's not taking the agreement seriously. Also, using \"Jim\" to guilt-trade is manipulative. The author stood her ground, which is reasonable in a situation where trust is fragile. She's not being unreasonable by enforcing the boundaries they agreed upon. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. The husband's actions and attitude are the main issues here. So the answer should be B.\n"
