Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a husband with a history of affairs and the wife setting boundaries as part of therapy. They agreed on a month-long guideline where the husband should be home by 10 and not drink with women. He broke that agreement by staying out past 10, even though he said he wouldn't. The wife called him out, they fought, and he dismissed her concerns, even using a friend to justify his actions.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author (the wife) is in the wrong. I need to think about the key points here. First, the affair history is a major trust issue. The therapist's advice was to set guidelines to rebuild trust, which they did. The husband agreed to these terms. Then he broke them. The wife is trying to hold him accountable, which seems reasonable given the circumstances. He's not just breaking a random rule but a specific agreement made in therapy, which is a structured effort to fix their marriage. His response was to argue and dismiss her feelings, even bringing in a third party (Jim) to guilt-trip her. That seems counterproductive.\n\nPossible angles: Is it too strict to ask for 10 PM? Maybe, but given the affair history, the wife has a valid reason for needing strict boundaries. The husband's refusal to follow the agreement, especially after making a commitment, could be seen as not taking the necessary steps to rebuild trust. The wife's anger and insistence on accountability are justified. The husband's behavior is undermining the process set by the therapist. So the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong. She's trying to rebuild trust as advised by a professional, and the husband's actions are a betrayal of that process. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
