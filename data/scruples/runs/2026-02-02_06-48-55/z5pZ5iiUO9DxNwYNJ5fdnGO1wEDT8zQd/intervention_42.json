Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's husband having multiple affairs, and they're in therapy. They set guidelines: husband should be home by 10 and not drink with women. He agreed, but then went out with friends, got a 45-minute delay, and tried to use \"Jim\" as an excuse. The author got angry and told him to come home. Now the husband says the 10 PM rule isn't workable anymore and he won't follow it.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The author tried to set boundaries after infidelity, which is serious. The husband agreed but then broke the agreement. The therapist's advice was to set guidelines for rebuilding trust. The author is enforcing the rules, which the husband is resisting. The husband's argument is that it's just one guy, but he's not following the agreed-upon terms. The author's anger is justified given the history of affairs. The husband's reaction seems dismissive and maybe minimizing the issue. The key here is whether the author is being unreasonable by expecting her husband to follow the agreed rules. Since the husband agreed and then broke them, the author's stance seems reasonable. The husband's refusal to adhere to the agreement undermines the rebuilding process. So the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
