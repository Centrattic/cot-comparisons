Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband who's had multiple affairs. They went to therapy and set some guidelines: he needs to be home by 10 PM and not drink with women. He agreed to this. Then he went out with friends, including a guy named Jim, and when he was supposed to be home by 10, he texted asking to stay out because it's just him and Jim. The wife told him coming home on time was important for rebuilding trust. He argued, they fought, and he ended up coming home 45 minutes late. He's also now saying the 10 PM rule isn't doable and won't follow it anymore, only 2 weeks left of the agreement.\n\nThe question is whether the author (the wife) is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The husband has a history of affairs, so trust is a big issue. They set these boundaries in therapy, which he agreed to. The wife is holding him accountable, which is part of the therapeutic plan. He broke the agreed-upon rule by staying out past 10 and then tried to make excuses. The wife's response was to express her hurt and anger, which is understandable given the betrayal. \n\nHe then dismissed her concerns, saying the time wasn't doable and he won't follow it anymore. That seems like a step back in the recovery process. The wife is within her rights to be upset. He's not respecting the boundaries they set, which is crucial for rebuilding trust. The arguments about \"just one guy\" and using Jim to make her feel guilty are manipulative. \n\nThe wife's main points are about accountability and trust. Since the husband agreed to the rules and then violated them, the wife isn't in the wrong for holding him to that. The answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. She's justified in her anger and trying to maintain the agreed boundaries.\n"
