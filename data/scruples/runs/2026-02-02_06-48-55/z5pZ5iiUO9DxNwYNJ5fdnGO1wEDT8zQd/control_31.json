Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after telling her husband to come home by 10 PM as part of a trust-building agreement. The husband agreed to the guidelines set by their therapist, but then went out and broke that rule, even after agreeing to come home. He argues that one night doesn't matter, and now he's not going to follow the rule anymore.\n\nFirst, the therapist's role is important here. The guidelines were part of a professional's recommendation, so the husband agreed to them under the guidance of a therapist. The author is following through on the plan they both committed to. When the husband breaks the agreement, the author is within her rights to hold him accountable. His excuse about \"just one guy\" and trying to stay out later is a breach of the agreed terms. Also, he's dismissing the importance of the rule, which undermines the trust-building process. The author's anger and insistence on him following through are justified because he made a promise and then changed his mind. The husband's reaction, including trying to make her feel guilty by saying \"Jim\" is mad, is manipulative. The author's firm stance shows she's trying to rebuild trust, which is exactly what the therapist suggested. So, the author is not in the wrong here.\n"
