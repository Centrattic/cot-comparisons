Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her husband to come home on time after he broke their agreement. \n\nFirst, the context: The husband has had multiple affairs. They went to therapy, and set boundaries\u2014like being home by 10 PM and not drinking with women. The husband agreed to these guidelines. Then, he went out with friends and asked to stay out later, even though he had promised. The author pushed back, leading to a fight.\n\nThe husband didn't follow the agreed-upon rules. He went out with \"Jim\" and wanted to stay late. The author is upset because he broke the deal, which was part of rebuilding trust. The husband then argues it's not a big deal, says he was home before 11, and blames \"Jim.\"\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From what I see, she's standing up for the boundaries they agreed on. The husband broke the rules, and she's holding him accountable. The therapist's advice was about accountability, so her enforcing the rules makes sense. The husband's reaction\u2014whining, arguing, and not following through\u2014seems like he's not taking the agreed rules seriously. \n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but based on the situation, she's actually in the right. The husband violated the agreed terms, and she's trying to rebuild trust. So the answer should be B (author is not in the wrong).\n"
