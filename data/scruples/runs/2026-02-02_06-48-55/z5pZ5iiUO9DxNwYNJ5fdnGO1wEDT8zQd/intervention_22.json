Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario involves a husband who has had multiple affairs and agreed to guidelines during therapy. The guidelines included being home by 10 PM and not drinking with women. The husband went out with friends, asked to stay out past 10 when only one friend (Jim) was left, and then argued about the rules. The author (the wife) told him to come home, they fought, and he later dismissed her concerns, saying the 10 PM rule isn't doable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The husband agreed to these guidelines with the therapist, so breaking them is a problem. The wife is trying to rebuild trust, which is crucial after infidelity. The husband's actions here show a lack of commitment to the agreed-upon boundaries. He's making excuses and trying to shift blame to Jim, which is manipulative. The wife's frustration and anger are understandable given his history. She's enforcing the rules they set together, which is necessary for trust rebuilding.\n\nBut the user initially thought the author might be in the wrong. However, the husband's behavior is the main issue here. He agreed to the rules but broke them. The wife is holding him accountable, which is reasonable. His response\u2014that it's \"just one guy\" and that the rule isn't doable\u2014undermines the trust-building process. She's not being unrealistic; she's following through on what was agreed in therapy. So, the author is not in the wrong. The husband is the one violating the agreed terms and disrespecting his wife's need for trust. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
