Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's husband having multiple affairs, and they've set up guidelines with their therapist to rebuild trust. The specific rule was that the husband should be home by 10 PM and avoid drinking with women. The husband broke this rule by staying out past the agreed time with a guy named Jim, arguing that it's just one guy and the other women had left. The author got angry, told him she might leave if he doesn't fix the marriage, and now the husband is refusing to follow the guidelines anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the key points. The couple had agreed on these boundaries in therapy to rebuild trust after infidelity. The husband agreed to them but then broke them. The author is enforcing the agreed-upon rules, which is a common practice in such therapeutic contexts. The husband is now backtracking, making excuses, and even trying to use \"Jim\" to guilt-trip her. \n\nThe question is whether the author is right to be upset. Trust issues after affairs are serious, and following agreed-upon steps is crucial. The husband's actions\u2014breaking the agreed rules, making excuses, and not taking accountability\u2014could be seen as undermining the process. The author's response, while firm, seems to be within her right to hold him accountable. The therapist's role was to set these guidelines, and the husband's refusal to adhere to them might indicate a lack of commitment to the marriage's recovery.\n\nHowever, there's a potential nuance. The husband might be feeling restricted, and the rule about being home by 10 might not be feasible for him. But since he agreed to it, then breaking it shows a lack of commitment. The author's anger is justified because he went back on his word, which is critical after cheating. The part where he used \"Jim\" to make her feel guilty is problematic because it's a manipulation tactic. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries and expecting the husband to follow through. The husband is the one who violated the agreement and is not taking responsibility. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
