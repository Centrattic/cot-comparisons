Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" story is in the wrong. The woman's husband had multiple affairs, and they set up guidelines with their therapist, including him being home by 10pm and not drinking with women. The husband agreed, but then broke the rule by staying out past 10 with his friend Jim, arguing about it, and now says he won't follow the rule. The question is if the author (the woman) is in the wrong for enforcing the agreement.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The husband has a history of infidelity, and they had a structured plan with the therapist. The woman is trying to rebuild trust by setting clear boundaries. When the husband breaks the agreed-upon rule, she's upset and calls him out, which leads to a fight. He then doubles down, saying the rule isn't doable and that his friend is mad at her. \n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author might be in the wrong, but they're unsure. I need to evaluate this from multiple angles. \n\nFrom the husband's perspective, maybe he's stressed or resistant to the strict rules, feeling controlled. However, he agreed to the terms, and breaking them could hinder trust rebuilding. The woman's actions are about enforcing the agreement they made, which is important for her healing and trust. \n\nThe husband's behavior\u2014breaking the agreement, making excuses, and then dismissing the rule\u2014might be more problematic. The woman's anger is justified because he broke his word, which is crucial after infidelity. Trust is fragile here, and his actions could indicate a lack of commitment to fixing the marriage. \n\nAlso, the husband's reaction to the rule being non-negotiable might show a lack of willingness to compromise, which is necessary in a relationship. The woman setting a boundary is valid. \n\nOn the other hand, could she be too strict? Maybe the husband's social life is important, but the rule was to avoid situations that could lead to further issues. The therapist's advice was to set clear guidelines, so she's following that. \n\nConsidering all this, the woman is acting within her rights to enforce the agreed terms. The husband's actions are the ones that broke the trust and the agreement. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong. So the answer should be B.\n"
