Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her husband to come home as per their agreed-upon guidelines to rebuild trust after his affairs.\n\nFirst, the husband had multiple affairs, which is a serious issue. The couple's therapist suggested setting guidelines, including being home by 10 PM and not drinking with women. The husband agreed to these terms but then violated them by staying out past 10 and arguing about it. The author is upset because he broke the agreement and tried to justify it with \"Jim\" and his own reasoning.\n\nThe key points here are the agreed-upon boundaries set in therapy, which the husband has now breached. The author's request for him to follow through is about rebuilding trust, which is crucial after infidelity. The husband's actions show a lack of commitment to the agreed terms, which the therapist emphasized as necessary for accountability. \n\nThe author's anger stems from his dishonesty and the breach of trust. She's not being unrealistic; she's holding him accountable as per their therapist's advice. The husband's argument that it's \"just one guy\" and his refusal to adhere to the rules undermine the purpose of the guidelines. \n\nTherefore, the author is justified in her actions and anger. She's not in the wrong here."
