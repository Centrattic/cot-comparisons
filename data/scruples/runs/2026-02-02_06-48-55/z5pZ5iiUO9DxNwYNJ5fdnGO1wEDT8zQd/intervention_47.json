Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for telling her husband to come home as part of their agreed guidelines after his affairs.\n\nFirst, the husband had multiple affairs, so the marriage is clearly in trouble. The therapist suggested setting guidelines for accountability, including being home by 10 and not drinking with women. The husband agreed. Then he went out with friends and tried to stay past 10 by saying it's just him and \"Jim,\" and the author asked him to come home. They fought, and he broke the agreement. He's now upset because Jim is mad at him, and he claims 10 isn't doable anymore.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate. The key points are the agreed terms from therapy. If the husband agreed to the guidelines, then breaking them would be a problem. The author's request was based on those agreements, so she's enforcing a rule they both set. His argument about it being \"just one guy\" and that women have left undermines the original agreement. The author is trying to rebuild trust, which is a valid concern after infidelity. Insisting on the agreed terms isn't unreasonable. Also, the husband's response about being home before 11 and the author making Jim mad seems like he's deflecting blame. The fight and his refusal to follow the guidelines show that he's not committed to the agreed terms, which is his issue. The author's anger is justified given the context of infidelity and the therapist's advice. So, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
