Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple working through infidelity with the help of a therapist. They've set guidelines, including the husband coming home by 10 PM and not drinking with women. He broke that rule by staying out later, and the author (the wife) called him out on it.\n\nFirst, the husband agreed to the terms during therapy. Breaking that agreement undermines the trust-building process. The wife is enforcing the rules they mutually set, which is a reasonable expectation. Her anger comes from his betrayal of trust and his attempt to dismiss her feelings by blaming \"Jim.\" \n\nHe argues that it's just one instance, but consistency is key in rebuilding trust after affairs. His defensiveness and refusal to adhere to the agreed terms suggest he's not fully committed to the process. The wife's reaction\u2014expressing her needs and setting boundaries\u2014is valid. She's not being unreasonable; she's holding him accountable as they agreed. \n\nThe husband's claim that 10 PM isn't doable might be a cop-out. The rules were set with a time frame to help him adjust, and if he's struggling, that's a conversation point, not a reason to ignore the agreement. The wife's frustration is justified given the history of affairs. \n\nSo, the author isn't wrong. She's standing up for her needs and the agreed-upon terms. The husband's behavior is the issue here. Therefore, the answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
