Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe husband has had multiple affairs, and they've been in therapy. The therapist suggested setting guidelines, like being home by 10 PM and not drinking with women. The husband agreed. Then he went out with friends, promised to come home by 10, but when it was 9:50, he asked if he could stay out because he was with \"Jim\" and others had left. The author told him that coming home on time would help rebuild trust. He argued, they fought, and he ended up coming home 45 minutes late. He claims being home before 11 was good enough, and now he says the 10 PM rule is too strict and won't follow it anymore. The author is upset because he broke the agreement, used \"Jim\" to guilt-trip her, and is now dismissing the rule.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion. The options are A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nFirst, let me consider the key points. The couple had an agreement in therapy to set boundaries. The husband agreed to them. Breaking that agreement when he was the one who needed to rebuild trust seems like a problem. The author is enforcing the rules, which are part of a structured plan to rebuild trust. The husband is not holding up his end, which is expected in such situations. \n\nThe husband's actions\u2014lying about the time he came home, being 45 minutes late, and then justifying it by saying 11 is okay\u2014indicate he's not taking the agreement seriously. Using \"Jim\" as a reason to stay out and then blaming the author for it might be a manipulative tactic. The author is standing by the agreed terms, which is reasonable. \n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author is wrong, but I don't see anything in the scenario where the author is being unfair. The husband agreed to the rules, and the author is holding him accountable. The husband's resistance and excuses seem to be the issue. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
