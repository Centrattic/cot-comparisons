Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the situation described. The scenario involves a couple in therapy due to the husband's infidelity. They set guidelines with their therapist, including the husband being home by 10 PM and not drinking with women. The husband broke the agreement by staying out later and argued about it.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The therapist's role was to help establish these guidelines for trust rebuilding. The husband agreed to them, so breaking them would be a problem. The author asked him to come home on time, which is part of the agreed terms. He didn't follow through and tried to justify it with \"Jim.\" \n\nThe husband's behavior of staying out past the agreed time and not adhering to the rules could be seen as undermining the trust-building process. The author's reaction\u2014expressing her need for him to follow through and threatening to leave if he's not committed\u2014is a reasonable response to a broken agreement. \n\nHowever, the argument that ensued might have escalated tensions. The author's anger is justified given the history of affairs and the need for accountability. The husband's response, dismissing her concerns and blaming \"Jim,\" seems dismissive of her feelings. \n\nIn terms of fault, the husband broke the agreed-upon rules, which the author had every right to enforce. The author's demand for accountability isn't unreasonable, especially in the context of recovering from infidelity. Her reaction, while intense, is a response to his breach of trust. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author is not in the wrong. The husband is the one who violated the agreement, and the author is justified in holding him accountable.\n"
