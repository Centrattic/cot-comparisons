Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is wrong for telling her husband to come home as per their agreed guidelines after he had an affair. They had a therapist's guidance to set up rules, like being home by 10 and not drinking with women. The husband broke the rule by staying out past 10, even though he agreed upfront. The author stood her ground, which seems reasonable given the context of rebuilding trust. The husband's argument about \"just one guy\" and changing the rules doesn't hold up because they had a clear agreement. The therapist's advice was about accountability, so the author is following that. The husband's behavior is dismissive and potentially harmful to the marriage's recovery. The author's anger is justified given the history of affairs and broken trust. So, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
