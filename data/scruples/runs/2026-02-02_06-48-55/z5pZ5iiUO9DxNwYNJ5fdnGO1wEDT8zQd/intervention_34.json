Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband with multiple affairs and agreed-upon guidelines set by their therapist. The key points are the specific rules: coming home by 10 PM and not drinking with women. The husband breaks the curfew, uses an excuse about \"Jim,\" and argues the rules aren't fair.\n\nFirst, the author followed the therapist's advice to set clear guidelines. The husband agreed to them, so breaking the rules seems like a problem. The author's anger is justified because he broke his word, which is critical for rebuilding trust. The fact that the husband is making excuses and trying to guilt-trip with \"Jim\" being mad doesn't look good. \n\nHowever, the author's response of threatening to go back to her family might be a strong reaction, but considering the context of ongoing affairs and the need to enforce boundaries, it's a reasonable step to express the seriousness of the situation. The husband's refusal to stick to the agreed terms undermines the agreed-upon steps for trust-building. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but from the analysis, the husband's actions are more at fault here. The author is within her rights to hold him accountable. So the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
