Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband with a history of affairs, and they've set up guidelines with their therapist to rebuild trust, including being home by 10 PM and not drinking with women. The husband breaks these rules, and the wife confronts him, leading to an argument where he dismisses her concerns and claims the rules aren't doable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of their agreement. They worked with a therapist to establish these guidelines, which the husband initially agreed to. Breaking those rules would naturally cause distrust. The wife is enforcing the agreed-upon terms to rebuild trust, which seems reasonable. The husband's actions\u2014staying out past the agreed time, arguing, and even trying to shift blame to \"Jim\"\u2014suggest he's not taking the situation seriously. \n\nThe key points here are accountability and communication. The wife is trying to hold him accountable for his actions, which is a valid part of trust rebuilding. The husband's response, especially using \"Jim\" to justify staying out and then being defensive, could be seen as manipulative or dismissive. \n\nIs the wife being too strict? Maybe not. After multiple affairs, strict guidelines are often necessary to rebuild trust. The husband's refusal to follow the agreed terms and his dismissive attitude might indicate he's not committed to the process. The wife's anger and setting a boundary by threatening to leave if he doesn't want to fix the marriage are her way of showing that she's serious about the relationship's future. \n\nSo, the author (the wife) isn't in the wrong here. She's standing by the terms they agreed on with the therapist. The husband is the one breaking the rules and not taking responsibility. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
