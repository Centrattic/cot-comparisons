Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (a wife) is in the wrong for telling her husband to come home after he broke their agreed-upon rules. The husband has a history of affairs, and they had a month-long agreement with specific guidelines, like coming home by 10 PM and not drinking with women. The husband went out with friends, asked to stay out past 10, and later came home late, arguing that the rules are too strict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The therapist recommended these guidelines to rebuild trust after multiple affairs. The husband agreed to them. Breaking the agreement could undermine the trust-building process. The author followed through by enforcing the rules when he violated them, which seems reasonable given the circumstances. She expressed her concerns about trust and stood her ground despite his arguments.\n\nThe husband's actions here are problematic. He went out of his way to break the agreed terms, even after knowing the importance of the rules. His response, claiming that 10 PM isn't doable and that he won't follow it anymore, shows a lack of commitment to the agreed-upon steps for rebuilding trust. His use of \"Jim\" as a reason to stay out might be a manipulation tactic to guilt-trip her.\n\nThe author's anger is justified. She's in a vulnerable position after the affairs, and the husband's actions could be seen as disrespectful to the agreement and the therapeutic process. She's trying to hold him accountable, which is necessary for their marriage to move forward. There's no indication that she was unreasonable or that her demands were outside the agreed terms. Instead, she's upholding the boundaries they set with their therapist.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. She's acting in a way that promotes accountability and trust, which are crucial in this situation. The husband is the one not adhering to the rules and being dismissive. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
