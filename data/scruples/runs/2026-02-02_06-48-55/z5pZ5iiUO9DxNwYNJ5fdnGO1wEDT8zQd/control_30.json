Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong. The situation involves the husband having multiple affairs, and the couple's therapist setting guidelines to rebuild trust. The specific issue here is the husband breaking the agreed-upon curfew and trying to make excuses.\n\nFirst, the husband agreed to be home by 10 PM as part of the therapy-guided plan. He went out with friends and tried to stay late, even after promising to follow the rules. The author confronted him and even threatened to leave if he didn't comply. He came home late, argued that 10 PM isn't feasible, and now the situation is causing tension. \n\nThe key points here are: 1) The guidelines were agreed upon in therapy, which is a structured process for both parties. 2) The husband violated the agreed terms, which is a direct breach of trust. 3) He's making excuses and trying to shift responsibility (\"Jim is mad at me\") rather than taking accountability. \n\nIn such cases, trust is crucial after infidelity. The author is setting boundaries to rebuild that trust, which is a reasonable and necessary step. The husband's behavior\u2014breaking the agreement and not taking it seriously\u2014undermines the entire process. The author's anger is justified because the husband isn't following through on his commitments, which was a key part of the therapist's advice. \n\nThere's no indication that the author is being unreasonable. She's holding him accountable as per the agreed guidelines. The husband's resistance and excuses suggest he's not fully committed to fixing the marriage. So, the author is not in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
