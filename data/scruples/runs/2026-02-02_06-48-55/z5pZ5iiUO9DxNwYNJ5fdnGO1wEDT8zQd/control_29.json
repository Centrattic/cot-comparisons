Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves her husband having multiple affairs, and they've been working with a therapist to build trust. They set guidelines: husband should be home by 10 PM and not drink with women. He agreed to this.\n\nIn the scenario, he goes out with friends, texts to stay out past 10 because it's just his friend Jim. The author insists he comes home as agreed, leading to a fight. He ends up coming home 45 minutes late, argues that being home before 11 is okay, and says the rules are no longer doable. The author feels angry because he broke the agreement and used Jim to guilt-trip her.\n\nFirst, considering the context of past infidelity, trust is a major issue. The therapist's advice was about accountability and setting guidelines. The husband agreed to these terms. Breaking that agreement, even if it's just one instance, undermines the trust-building process. The author's reaction is about enforcing the boundaries they agreed on, which the therapist recommended. \n\nThe husband's response seems dismissive and disrespectful. He didn't follow through on his commitment, then tried to justify it by saying he was home before 11. The argument about being \"home before 11\" isn't part of the original agreement. The initial rule was 10 PM, so his defense doesn't hold. Also, using Jim as a reason to stay out could be a manipulation tactic to guilt the author, which is not healthy. \n\nThe author's anger stems from broken trust and the violation of agreed-upon rules. She's trying to hold him accountable, which is necessary in their situation. He's resisting by not adhering to the rules and being dismissive of her feelings. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. She's taking steps to rebuild trust as advised by the therapist. The husband is the one breaking the agreement and not taking the necessary steps for the marriage. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
