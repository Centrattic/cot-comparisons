Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the wife) is in the wrong for telling her husband to come home on time after he agreed to guidelines set by their therapist. The husband had multiple affairs and they've been working on rebuilding trust. The therapist set a rule of being home by 10 PM for a month. The husband agreed but then broke the rule, argued about it, and even tried to justify staying out by mentioning 'Jim'.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The husband has a history of infidelity, which is a major breach of trust. The therapist's guidelines are part of the process to rebuild that trust. The wife is enforcing the agreed-upon rules, which is reasonable. When the husband breaks the rule, the wife is upset and stands her ground. The husband's response seems dismissive and even tries to shift blame by making 'Jim' mad at the wife. That's a manipulative tactic, which indicates he's not taking responsibility.\n\nThe key points here are accountability and trust. The wife is trying to hold her husband accountable as agreed. The husband breaking the rules undermines the trust-building process. The wife's anger stems from his dishonesty and lack of commitment to the agreed terms. The fact that he's only following the rules for the remaining two weeks suggests he's not fully committed, which is concerning.\n\nIt's important to note that after infidelity, rebuilding trust requires consistency and effort from both partners. The wife is doing her part by enforcing the rules, while the husband is showing resistance and making excuses. The wife's actions are justified as she's trying to protect her emotional well-being and the integrity of their agreed-upon plan. The husband's behavior is the issue here, not the wife's expectations. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
