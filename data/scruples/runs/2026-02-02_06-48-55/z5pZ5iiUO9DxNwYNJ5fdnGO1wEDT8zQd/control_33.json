Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves her husband having multiple affairs, and they set up boundaries with their therapist. The key points are the agreed-upon rules of being home by 10 PM and not drinking with women. The husband breaks the rule by staying out past 10, uses a friend (Jim) as an excuse, and then argues that the rule isn't doable anymore.\n\nFirst, the author set boundaries with the therapist's guidance. That seems reasonable because rebuilding trust after infidelity often requires structure. The husband agreed to those rules, so he's the one violating them. When he asked to stay out, the author reminded him of the agreement, which is a legitimate expectation. His response\u2014arguing and then breaking the agreement\u2014shows a lack of accountability. \n\nThen he mentions being home before 11 and texting before 10, which doesn't align with the agreed 10 PM curfew. His attempt to justify it by saying \"10 isn't doable\" after breaking the rule seems like an excuse. Also, using the friend Jim to make her feel guilty is a manipulation tactic, which isn't healthy. \n\nThe author's anger is justified given the history of affairs and the need for trust-building. The therapist's input supports the boundaries, so she's following professional advice. Her stance isn't unreasonable; it's part of the agreed-upon process. The husband isn't holding up his end, which is why the fight happened. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The husband is the one violating the agreed terms and not taking accountability. The answer should be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
