Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The scenario involves a married couple dealing with the husband's affairs and trying to rebuild trust through therapy. The couple agreed on guidelines: the husband must be home by 10 and not drink with women. He breaks this agreement by staying out past 10, uses an excuse about being with just one guy, and then gets defensive.\n\nThe author (the wife) is upset because he broke the agreed-upon rules and used \"Jim\" as an excuse. She stood her ground, leading to an argument where she threatened to leave if he wasn't committed to fixing the marriage. He came home late and now claims the rule isn't doable.\n\nI need to evaluate who is in the wrong. The husband agreed to the rules but violated them. The wife is enforcing the boundaries set in therapy. It's important to consider whether her expectations are reasonable. The therapist recommended accountability, so the wife is trying to follow that. The husband's behavior undermines trust, and his excuses (like staying out with one guy) don't align with the agreed guidelines. His defensiveness and refusal to follow the rules suggest he's not taking the rebuilding process seriously. The wife's anger is justified given his history. So, the author is not in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
