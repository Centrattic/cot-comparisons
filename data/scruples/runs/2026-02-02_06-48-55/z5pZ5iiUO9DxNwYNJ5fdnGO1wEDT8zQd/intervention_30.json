Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband with multiple affairs, and they've set guidelines with their therapist. The husband agreed to be home by 10 PM, but he broke that agreement by staying out past the time, using an excuse about being with a guy named Jim. The wife confronts him, and they fight, leading her to threaten leaving if he doesn't change. The husband then dismisses her concerns.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The husband has a history of infidelity, which is a significant issue. The therapist suggested accountability measures, which both agreed to. The wife is following through on the agreed-upon rules, which is reasonable. When the husband breaks the agreement, the wife is justified in being upset. The husband's argument that \"it's just one guy\" and trying to shift blame onto Jim might be a way to avoid taking responsibility. \n\nThe wife's anger stems from a place of needing trust rebuilt. The husband not only broke the rule but also dismissed her feelings and tried to make her feel guilty. That's problematic. From a relationship standpoint, accountability is crucial after infidelity. The wife is enforcing the boundaries they agreed on, which is her right. \n\nThe husband's refusal to follow the rules anymore, even after the agreed time is up, suggests he's not committed to the process. The wife's response, while firm, is about holding him accountable. She's not being unreasonable; she's following through on the steps they set together. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the author (the wife) isn't in the wrong. She's trying to rebuild trust within the agreed framework. The husband's actions and attitude are the main issues here. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
