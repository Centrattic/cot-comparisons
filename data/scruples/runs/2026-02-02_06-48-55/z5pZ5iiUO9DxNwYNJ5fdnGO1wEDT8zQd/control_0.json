Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe author's husband has had multiple affairs. They went to therapy, and the therapist said he needs to be held accountable and set up some guidelines to rebuild trust. The agreed guidelines include him being home by 10 PM for a month and not drinking with women. The husband initially agrees to these terms. Then, on the first night he goes out with his friends, he texts the author at 9:50 asking if he can stay out because only \"Jim\" is left, implying that the other women have left. The author insists he should come home by 10, arguing that following the agreed time is important for trust. The husband argues back, saying it's just one guy and that he shouldn't be forced to come home, leading to a big fight. The author even threatens to leave if he doesn't want to fix the marriage. The husband comes home 45 minutes late, claims he was home before 11, and now is upset with the author because \"Jim\" is mad at her. The husband also says that 10 PM isn't doable and won't follow it anymore, even though the guidelines are only in place for a month and he has two weeks left.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I should consider the context. The husband has a history of affairs, so the author is probably dealing with significant trust issues. The therapist's advice was to set guidelines, which the couple did. The husband agreed to these guidelines, so he's making a promise. The first time he's supposed to follow through, he breaks it by staying out past 10, even though the other women had left. But the author is upset because he didn't stick to the agreed time, even if it was just with a male friend now.\n\nThe key points here are the agreed-upon rules and the husband's actions. The rule was to be home by 10, not about whether other people are present. So if he went out with the guys, but still stayed out past 10, that's a breach of the agreement. The fact that the women had left might be relevant, but the agreement was about the time, not about the company. The husband is trying to shift the blame by mentioning \"Jim\" and the women who left, which could be a tactic to make the author feel guilty or to justify his lateness.\n\nThe author's response was to stand her ground, emphasizing the importance of trust. When he didn't comply, she threatened to leave, which is a serious step. However, in the context of a marriage where trust has been broken, such a threat might be a last resort to communicate the severity of the situation.\n\nThe husband came home 45 minutes late, which is a significant delay, and then claims that being home before 11 is acceptable, which seems to be ignoring the specific rule they made. He also says that the 10 PM curfew isn't doable, but that's after breaking it once. The guidelines were supposed to be for a month to rebuild trust, so consistency is key. If he's already breaking the rules in the first week, that shows a lack of commitment to the agreement.\n\nNow, the author is questioning if she was wrong to enforce the rules and to be angry. The main issue is whether the rules were reasonable and if the husband's actions justified her anger. The rules were set by the therapist as part of the process, so they are likely designed to help rebuild trust. The husband agreed to them, so he's responsible for following through. The fact that he's now trying to manipulate the situation by pointing out that \"Jim\" is mad at the author suggests he's not taking her concerns seriously and is instead turning the situation back on her, which is problematic.\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong here. She has valid reasons for being upset because the husband broke a trust agreement they both set. The guidelines are for rebuilding trust, and his actions undermine that. His response (arguing, guilt-tripping, not following the rules) is more concerning than her enforcing the rules. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
