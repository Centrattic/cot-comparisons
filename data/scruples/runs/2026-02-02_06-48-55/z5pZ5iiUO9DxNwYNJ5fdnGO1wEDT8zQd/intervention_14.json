Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple dealing with infidelity and trying to rebuild trust through therapy. The key points here are the agreed-upon guidelines from their therapist: the husband must be home by 10 PM and avoid drinking with women. The husband breaks these rules, leading to a fight.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the actions of both parties. The author set clear boundaries with professional guidance, and the husband agreed to follow them. When he broke the rules, he tried to justify it by saying it was \"just one guy\" and argued about the time. The husband also ignored the drinking rule if he was with another woman, which is part of the agreed guidelines. His actions seem to undermine the trust-building process.\n\nThe author's response was to stand by the rules and express her need for trust. She even mentions that the husband's behavior is making her consider leaving, which is a serious consequence. The husband then dismissed her feelings by saying being home before 11 is \"good enough,\" which doesn't align with their agreement. He also tried to shift blame onto \"Jim\" being mad at the author, which could be a manipulation tactic.\n\nIn terms of accountability, the husband isn't holding up his end of the agreement. The therapist's role was to create a structured plan for rebuilding trust, and the husband's non-compliance suggests he's not fully committed. The author is within her rights to be upset and enforce the boundaries they mutually agreed upon. Her anger stems from broken trust and a need for consistency in the recovery process.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. She's trying to maintain the agreed terms for the sake of the marriage, while the husband is the one violating those terms and not taking the necessary steps to rebuild trust. So the answer should be B.\n"
