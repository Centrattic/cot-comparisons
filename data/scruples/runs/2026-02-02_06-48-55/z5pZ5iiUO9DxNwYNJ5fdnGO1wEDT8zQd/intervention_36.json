Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user provided a situation where a wife is upset because her husband broke an agreement they made with their therapist to be home by 10 PM. The husband went out with his friend Jim, asked if he could stay out, and then came home late. The wife is questioning if she was wrong for standing by the agreement.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple is working with a therapist because of the husband's affairs. The therapist suggested guidelines, including being home by 10 and not drinking with women. The husband agreed to these terms. Then, when he breaks them, the wife enforces the agreement, leading to a fight.\n\nThe user thinks the author (the wife) is in the wrong but wants another opinion. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nPoints to consider: The husband agreed to the rules, so breaking them and not following through could be his fault. The wife is trying to hold him accountable, which is part of the therapist's advice. However, maybe the wife's response was too harsh by threatening to leave? But given the context of rebuilding trust after affairs, her actions might be justified. The husband's argument that he's not willing to follow the rules anymore could indicate a problem in his commitment to the marriage. The wife's anger stems from broken trust and not following agreed terms. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the wife was too strict or didn't consider his perspective? But the therapist's guidelines are in place for a reason. The husband's behavior (whining, trying to guilt-trip with Jim) might have provoked her. The wife's response, while emotional, might be a result of frustration from past infidelities. \n\nI think the key points here are about accountability and commitment. The husband agreed to the terms but didn't follow through, which is his wrongdoing. The wife is enforcing the agreement, which is necessary for trust-building. While their argument was intense, her stance isn't unreasonable given the circumstances. So the author (wife) isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
