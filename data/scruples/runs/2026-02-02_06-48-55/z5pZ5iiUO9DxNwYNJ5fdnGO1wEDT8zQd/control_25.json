Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (a wife) is in the wrong for telling her husband to come home after he broke their agreed-upon rules.\n\nFirst, the context: The husband has a history of affairs. They set boundaries with their therapist, including being home by 10 PM and not drinking with women. He agreed to these terms. Last night, he went out and texted late, asking to stay out because only one guy (Jim) was left. The wife insisted he come home, leading to a fight where she threatened to leave. He came home late and now refuses to follow the rules, saying 10 PM isn't doable.\n\nThe key points here are accountability and trust. The therapist's guidance was to hold him accountable, so the wife is enforcing the agreed-upon rules. He violated the agreement by staying out past 10 and then tried to justify it. His argument that \"it's just one guy\" and \"women have left\" contradicts his previous agreement not to drink with women. The wife's anger is justified because he broke his word, which is critical after infidelity. Threatening to leave if he doesn't fix the marriage is a reasonable response to his non-compliance. The husband's reaction\u2014being defensive, making excuses, and now refusing to follow the rules\u2014undermines the trust rebuilding process.\n\nThe question is whether the wife is wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Since she's upholding the agreement and he's the one breaking it, the answer should be B. She's not wrong for holding him to the terms they mutually agreed on, especially under professional guidance. His behavior is the issue here, not her standing by the rules.\n"
