Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband with a history of affairs and agreed-upon guidelines to rebuild trust. The couple's therapist set conditions, including a curfew and no drinking with women. The husband breaks the curfew and gets defensive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The husband has had multiple affairs, which is a significant breach of trust. The therapist's guidelines are part of a structured plan to rebuild that trust. The husband agreed to these terms, so when he breaks them, it's a direct violation of the agreement. The author of the post is upset because he didn't follow through, argued, and tried to justify his actions. \n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate that. The author's anger stems from the husband's dishonesty and refusal to take accountability. The husband's actions could be seen as undermining the therapy process and the effort to fix the marriage. The author's response\u2014threatening to leave if he's not committed\u2014seems like a justified expression of her frustration and a boundary. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the curfew is too strict or that the husband had a valid reason. However, given the context of rebuilding trust after infidelity, strict guidelines are often necessary. The husband's lack of accountability and defensiveness are problematic. The author is not being unreasonable; she's enforcing the agreed-upon terms that were set with their therapist. \n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong. The husband's behavior is the issue here, so the answer should be B.\n"
