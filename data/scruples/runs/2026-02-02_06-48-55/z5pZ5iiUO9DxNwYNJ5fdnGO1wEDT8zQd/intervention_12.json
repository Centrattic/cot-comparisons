Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the situation is about a couple dealing with infidelity and trying to rebuild trust through therapy. The husband has agreed to certain guidelines, like being home by 10 and not drinking with women. He goes out with friends, says he won't be home on time because he's with a guy named Jim, and then argues about the rules. The wife is upset because he broke the agreement and tried to guilt-train her with Jim.\n\nThe question is whether the author (the wife) is in the wrong. The user initially thought she might be in the wrong but is unsure. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the husband agreed to specific terms in therapy. If he's breaking those terms, the wife is justified in holding him accountable. She's following the therapist's advice to set boundaries. When he went out past 10, even if he was with a man, that's a breach. The fact that he later says 10pm isn't doable might indicate he's not serious about the agreement, which could be a red flag.\n\nThe wife's anger stems from his dishonesty and breaking their agreement. Her setting a boundary by threatening to go back to her family if he doesn't commit to fixing the marriage is a response to his lack of accountability. She's not being unreasonable for expecting him to follow through on what he agreed to. \n\nHe's also trying to manipulate by saying Jim is mad at her, which could be a tactic to shift blame. The wife's frustration is valid given the history of affairs. Holding him to the agreed-upon rules is part of rebuilding trust, not being unrealistic. \n\nSo, considering all that, the wife isn't in the wrong here. The husband is the one not honoring the agreement and being defensive. Therefore, the answer should be B, meaning the author is not in the wrong.\n"
