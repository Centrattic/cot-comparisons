Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the wife) is in the wrong after telling her husband to come home on time. The husband has a history of affairs, and they had agreed on guidelines through therapy to rebuild trust. The key points here are the agreed-upon rules, the husband's actions, and the wife's response.\n\nFirst, the couple worked with their therapist to set specific boundaries: husband needs to be home by 10 PM and avoid drinking with women. He agreed to these terms. Then, when he went out, he broke the agreement by staying out later and tried to justify it by saying he was with a guy named Jim. The wife stood her ground, emphasizing the importance of trust and the agreement. \n\nThe husband's actions\u2014breaking the agreed-upon rule, making excuses, and even implying that the wife's insistence made Jim angry\u2014show a lack of accountability. The wife's anger is justified because he violated the trust-building steps they both committed to. She's not being unrealistic; she's holding him to the standards they set together with their therapist. His refusal to adhere to the rules undermines the process. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
