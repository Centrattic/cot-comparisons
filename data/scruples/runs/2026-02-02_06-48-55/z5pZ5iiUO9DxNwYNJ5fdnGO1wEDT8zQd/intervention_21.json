Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband who's had multiple affairs, and they're in therapy trying to rebuild trust. They agreed on some guidelines, like being home by 10 and not drinking with women. The husband broke that rule by staying out past 10, even though he had initially agreed to it. The author (the wife) confronted him and they fought, leading to her threatening to leave if he didn't commit to fixing the marriage.\n\nSo, the author is being accused of being too strict or unrealistic. But the husband had agreed to the terms in therapy, right? He broke them, and then tried to make excuses, even using a friend named Jim to justify staying out. The wife stands by the agreement they made with their therapist. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the wife had a right to expect him to follow through on their agreed terms, especially after his infidelity. Breaking that agreement would naturally cause her to feel hurt and lose trust. Her anger is a valid reaction given the circumstances. The husband, on the other hand, is being inconsistent\u2014he agreed to the rules but then dismissed them when it was inconvenient. \n\nAlso, when he came home late, he tried to justify it by saying he was home before 11 and that the time was \"good enough.\" That seems like he's not taking the agreement seriously. Plus, using Jim to make her feel guilty is a manipulative tactic. \n\nThe wife's actions\u2014setting boundaries and expressing her anger\u2014are reasonable in a situation where trust is being rebuilt. She's not being unrealistic; she's holding him accountable as recommended by their therapist. The husband's resistance to the agreed-upon guidelines and his excuses suggest he's not committed to the process, which is the real issue here. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. The husband is the one breaking the rules they agreed on, and her reaction is appropriate given the betrayal and the need to rebuild trust.\n"
