Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong after telling her husband to come home on time to rebuild trust after his affairs.\n\nFirst, the husband had multiple affairs, so the marriage is already strained. The couple worked with a therapist to set guidelines: husband must be home by 10 PM and not drink with women. He agreed to these terms. Then, he went out with friends, texted the author at 9:50 asking if he can stay out because only \"Jim\" remains, and he's with him. The author insists on him coming home on time. He argues, they fight, she threatens to leave, and he comes home 45 minutes late. He later justifies it by saying he was home before 11 and that \"Jim\" is mad at her.\n\nThe author is upset because he broke his word and used \"Jim\" to guilt-trait her. The question is whether she's wrong for enforcing the agreed-upon rules.\n\nLooking at the situation, the husband agreed to the guidelines as part of therapy to rebuild trust. By breaking the agreement and trying to rationalize his behavior, he's not following through on his commitments, which is a problem. The author is enforcing the boundaries they set together. Her anger stems from a place of needing trust rebuilt, which is understandable given the infidelity. The husband's argument that \"it's just one guy\" undermines the agreed terms. She's not being unreasonable; she's holding him accountable as per their therapeutic plan. The husband's behavior (late return, justifying it, blaming others) seems to be the issue here. So, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
