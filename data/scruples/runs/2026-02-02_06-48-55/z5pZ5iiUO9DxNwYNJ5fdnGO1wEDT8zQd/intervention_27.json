Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband with multiple affairs and their attempts to rebuild trust through therapy. They set some guidelines, like being home by 10 and not drinking with women. The husband breaks the rule by staying out past 10 and argues with the author, then later dismisses the agreement.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple is in therapy, and the guidelines were part of a structured effort to rebuild trust. The husband agreed to these terms but then broke them. The author called him out, which seems like a reasonable response given their agreed-upon boundaries. \n\nThe husband's actions\u2014breaking a specific rule they both set\u2014could be seen as undermining the trust-building process. The author's anger is justified because he didn't follow through on his commitment, which is crucial after infidelity. \n\nHowever, the husband claims that the rule isn't doable anymore, and he's only in the last two weeks of the month. Maybe there's some flexibility here, but the issue is about accountability. The author wanted him to stick to the agreement to rebuild trust, and his actions (texting to stay out, arguing, and then dismissing the rule) show a lack of commitment to the process. \n\nAlso, the husband's response about \"Jim\" being mad might be an attempt to shift blame or guilt-trip the author. The author's anger in this case is understandable. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong because she's holding her husband accountable to the agreed-upon terms. The husband's behavior is the problem here, not her for enforcing the boundaries. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
