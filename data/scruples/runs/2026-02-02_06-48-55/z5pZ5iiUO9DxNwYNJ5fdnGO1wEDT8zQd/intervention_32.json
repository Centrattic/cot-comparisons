Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user asked if the author is in the wrong in the situation described. The original post is about a woman whose husband had multiple affairs. They set up guidelines with their therapist, including the husband coming home by 10 and not drinking with women. He broke the agreement by staying out past 10 and tried to get out of it by saying he'd stay with a guy named Jim. The author got angry and told him if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, she'll go home.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The couple made a mutual agreement in therapy to set boundaries. The husband agreed to these terms. Breaking them would be a violation. The woman is enforcing the agreed-upon rules. She's upset because he's not following through, which is about rebuilding trust. His arguing and dismissing her concerns could be seen as undermining the process. The fact that he tried to use Jim as an excuse might be an attempt to manipulate the situation. \n\nThe author's actions were based on the agreed-upon guidelines. She's holding him accountable, which is part of the therapist's advice. His breaking the rules and not respecting her feelings could indicate a lack of commitment to the marriage. The woman's anger is justified because he's not honoring their agreement. She also set a consequence for his actions, which is a reasonable response in the context of trying to rebuild trust. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that he stayed out for a short time and that the rule might be too strict. But considering the history of affairs, strict rules might be necessary to rebuild trust. The husband's refusal to follow the agreement and his dismissive attitude could be more problematic. The author isn't in the wrong for enforcing the terms they agreed on. So, the answer would be B (No) because she's acting within the framework of their agreement and working on trust issues.\n"
