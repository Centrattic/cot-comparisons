Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband who's had multiple affairs, and they've set guidelines with their therapist to rebuild trust. The specific rule was being home by 10 PM. The husband went out with friends, asked to stay out past 10, and the author pushed him to come home. They ended up in a big fight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The husband has a history of affairs, so the trust issue is significant. The therapist's guidelines were part of a structured plan to rebuild that trust. The husband agreed to these guidelines, so breaking them could be seen as a breach of trust. The author's actions were trying to enforce the agreed-upon rules, which is understandable given the past infidelities.\n\nThe husband's argument that it's \"just one guy\" and that the women have left doesn't hold weight because the initial rule was about not drinking with women, not about the number of people. Also, he's trying to justify staying out past the agreed time by saying he was home before 11, which technically wasn't the rule. The author is concerned about consistency and trust, which are crucial in such situations.\n\nThe husband's reaction, including whining and trying to shift blame to \"Jim,\" shows a lack of accountability. The author's anger stems from the husband's failure to follow through on commitments made during therapy, which is a critical part of rebuilding the relationship. \n\nConsidering all these points, the author isn't in the wrong for upholding the agreed rules to maintain trust and address the husband's past behavior. The husband's actions and excuses undermine the therapeutic process and the trust-building efforts. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
