Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe user's husband has had multiple affairs, and they've been in therapy. The therapist suggested setting guidelines for him to rebuild trust. They agreed on a one-month plan where he should be home by 10 PM and not drink with women. The husband agreed to this. Last night, he went out with friends, told the author he'd be home by 10, but at 9:50, he asked if he could stay out because it was just him and \"Jim.\" The author reminded him of the agreement, but he argued and they fought. The husband came home 45 minutes late, said he texted her before 11 and that \"Jim\" is mad at her. He also said he won't follow the rule anymore because it's not doable.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (Yes) or B (No).\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The couple agreed on specific guidelines in therapy to rebuild trust after affairs. The husband agreed to these terms. Breaking the agreement could be seen as a breach of trust, which is a serious issue. The author is enforcing the agreed-upon rules, which were part of a plan to fix the marriage. The husband is not following through, which undermines the trust-building process. The author's anger and setting a boundary (threatening to leave if he doesn't want to fix the marriage) seem reasonable given the context. The husband's argument that it's \"just one guy\" and that he's unwilling to follow the rules anymore suggests he's not taking the agreement seriously, which is problematic.\n\nIn relationships, when there's a history of infidelity, setting clear boundaries is crucial. The therapist's involvement indicates that the couple is working through these issues, and the guidelines are part of that process. The author is holding the husband accountable, which is necessary for trust to be rebuilt. The husband's actions of breaking the agreed-upon rules and then justifying it (using \"Jim\" as an excuse and not following the curfew) show a lack of commitment to the agreed terms. The author's reaction is about maintaining the integrity of the agreement and protecting her own emotional well-being, which is valid.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Some might say the author is being too strict or that the husband is being reasonable if he's trying to socialize. However, given the context of multiple affairs and the therapeutic process, strict adherence to the agreement is not just about socializing but about rebuilding trust. The husband's behavior could be seen as a step back, and the author's anger is a justified response to his noncompliance. Additionally, the husband's use of guilt-tripping (\"Jim is mad at you\") is manipulative, which further supports the idea that the author is not in the wrong.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is not in the wrong. She is upholding the agreed terms that were set to address the husband's infidelity and rebuild trust. The husband's failure to follow through and his arguments against the rules indicate that he's not taking the necessary steps to fix the marriage. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
