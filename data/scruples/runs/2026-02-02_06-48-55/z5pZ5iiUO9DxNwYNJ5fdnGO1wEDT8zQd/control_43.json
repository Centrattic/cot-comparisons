Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband with multiple affairs and a structured plan from their therapist to rebuild trust. The key points are the agreed-upon guidelines: home by 10 PM and no drinking with women. The husband breaks these by staying out past 10, uses a friend as an excuse, and then dismisses the importance of the rule.\n\nFirst, the therapist's role here is crucial. They set these guidelines for the husband to follow, which he initially agreed to. Breaking these terms would undermine the trust-building process. The wife is enforcing what was agreed upon, which is a reasonable expectation after infidelity. Her anger stems from his breach of trust and the effort to hold him accountable as advised by the therapist.\n\nThe husband's excuses\u2014like it being \"just one guy\" and the women having left\u2014don't negate the agreement. The rule was about the time, not the company. His lateness by 45 minutes and his deflection (saying he was home before 11 and that Jim is mad) show a lack of respect for the agreement. The wife's ultimatum about leaving if he doesn't fix the marriage is a strong stance but understandable given the circumstances. \n\nConsidering all this, the wife isn't being unrealistic. She's following professional advice and maintaining boundaries. The husband is the one not adhering to the agreed terms. So, the answer is B\u2014she's not in the wrong.\n"
