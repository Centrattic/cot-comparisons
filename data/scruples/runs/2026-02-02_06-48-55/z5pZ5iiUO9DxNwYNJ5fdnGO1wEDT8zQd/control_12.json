Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband with multiple affairs, and the couple's therapist has set guidelines for him to rebuild trust, including being home by 10 PM and not drinking with women. The husband breaks these rules by staying out past 10, even though he initially agreed to them. The author confronts him, leading to an argument, and he later dismisses the agreed-upon time, saying it's not doable.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the agreed-upon boundaries set by the therapist. The husband explicitly agreed to these terms, so breaking them undermines the trust-building process. The author is following the therapist's advice by holding him accountable, which is a reasonable step in such circumstances. \n\nThe husband's actions\u2014ignoring the agreed bedtime, arguing about it, and then dismissing the rule\u2014show a lack of commitment to the agreed terms. His use of \"Jim\" to justify staying out and then blaming the author for making him look bad to his friend seems like an attempt to deflect responsibility. \n\nThe author's anger stems from the husband not adhering to their agreement, which is a legitimate concern when trying to rebuild trust after infidelity. Trust is crucial here, and the husband's inconsistency could hinder the process. The author isn't being unrealistic; she's holding him to the standards they mutually agreed on with professional guidance. \n\nHowever, it's also important to consider that the husband's resistance might indicate deeper issues, like a lack of willingness to change or commitment to the marriage. The fact that he's only following the rules for 2 more weeks might suggest he's not fully invested in the process. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for enforcing the agreed terms and being upset about the husband's non-compliance. The husband is the one breaking the set boundaries, so the answer should be B (No).\n"
