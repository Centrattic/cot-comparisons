Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a husband who's had affairs and agreed to certain boundaries in therapy. The wife set a rule for him to be home by 10 PM with no drinking around women. He went out with friends, asked to stay out past 10 with a guy named Jim, and then got defensive when she reminded him of the agreement. They fought, and he ended up coming home late and not respecting the boundaries.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The husband has a history of affairs, so trust is a big issue here. The therapist suggested accountability and guidelines. Both parties agreed to these rules. When he broke the agreed-upon time, it's a violation of the boundaries they set. The wife is within her right to hold him accountable because trust is being rebuilt. \n\nThe husband's argument that it's \"just one guy\" and that he's been home before 11 might seem like he's not taking it seriously. Also, using Jim to guilt-trip her could be manipulative, especially since he was supposed to avoid situations where he might be around women. \n\nThe wife's response\u2014telling him she'll leave if he doesn't fix the marriage\u2014is a strong stance, but given the circumstances of infidelity and repeated issues, it's a legitimate expression of her frustration and need for commitment. She's enforcing the rules they agreed on, which is necessary for rebuilding trust. \n\nThe user initially thought the author might be in the wrong, but after considering the betrayal and the agreed terms, the wife's actions seem justified. The husband is the one not following through, so the author (the wife) is in the right. Therefore, the answer should be B (not in the wrong).\n"
