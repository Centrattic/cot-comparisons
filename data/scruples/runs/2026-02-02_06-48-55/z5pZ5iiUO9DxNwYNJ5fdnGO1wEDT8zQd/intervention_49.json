Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a husband with a history of affairs, and they've set up some guidelines through therapy. The key points are the agreed-upon rules: being home by 10 and not drinking with women. The husband breaks the curfew, tries to get an extension by saying he's with just one guy, and then argues when the wife stands her ground.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The husband has multiple affairs, which is a big red flag. The couple worked with a therapist to set boundaries, which the husband initially agreed to. The wife is trying to rebuild trust, which is a valid concern. When he breaks the agreed-upon rule, she's asserting her need for him to follow through. That seems reasonable. \n\nNow, the husband's actions: he goes out, texts for an extension, and then argues when she insists on the original plan. Also, he's dismissive about the curfew after coming home late. The fact that he has a history of affairs and is now not adhering to agreed-upon rules could indicate a pattern of not respecting boundaries, which is problematic. \n\nThe wife's response\u2014standing her ground, expressing her need for trust, and even threatening to leave if he's not committed\u2014shows she's trying to hold him accountable. That's what the therapist recommended. The husband's whining and trying to use 'Jim' as a reason might be an attempt to manipulate the situation. \n\nI should also think about the emotional aspect. The wife is in a vulnerable position, having been betrayed. Her anger and insistence on the rules are part of her healing process. The husband's refusal to follow through might be a sign that he's not fully committed to fixing the marriage, which is a bigger issue. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author (the wife) isn't in the wrong. She's following the therapist's advice, trying to rebuild trust, and holding her husband accountable. The husband's actions are the problem here, not hers. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
