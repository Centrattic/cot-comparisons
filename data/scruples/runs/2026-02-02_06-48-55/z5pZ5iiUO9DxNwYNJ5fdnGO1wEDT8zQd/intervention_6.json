Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again. The husband has had multiple affairs, and they went to therapy. The therapist suggested guidelines, like being home by 10 and not drinking with women. The husband agreed to this. Then, when he went out with friends, he called to stay late with \"Jim,\" which he said he wouldn't do. The author asked him to come home on time, but he argued and they had a big fight. He ended up coming home 45 minutes late and now says the rule isn't doable.\n\nThe author is upset that he broke their agreement and used \"Jim\" to guilt-trait her. She's wondering if she's being too strict. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants another opinion.\n\nFirst, let's consider the context. The husband has a history of affairs, so trust is a big issue here. Therapy guidelines are meant to rebuild trust. The husband agreed to these rules, yet he broke them. The author is standing her ground by holding him accountable. When he asked to stay out late with a guy named Jim, the author is concerned because the original agreement was to not drink with women. But Jim is a man, so maybe the husband is twisting the rules. However, the husband also mentions that women left, so maybe he's trying to justify staying out. But the main rule was being home by 10, regardless of who is there.\n\nThe author's response seems reasonable. She's enforcing the agreed-upon boundaries to rebuild trust. When he argues, she points out the importance of his word and the agreement. His coming home late and then blaming Jim seems like he's not taking the situation seriously. The fact that he says the 10 PM rule isn't doable after only trying once might show he's not committed to the agreement.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. If she's pushing for strict adherence to rules that were mutually agreed upon in therapy with the therapist's guidance, then she's acting in good faith. The husband's actions (breaking the agreement, not following through, and being defensive) seem to be the problem here. She's trying to fix the marriage by holding him accountable, which is reasonable after infidelity. The husband's resistance and guilt-tripping might be the main issues. So, the author isn't in the wrong; she's standing up for the boundaries they set together. Therefore, the answer should be B (author not in the wrong).\n"
