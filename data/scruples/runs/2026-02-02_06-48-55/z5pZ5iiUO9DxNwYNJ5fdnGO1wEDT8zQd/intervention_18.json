Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband who had multiple affairs, and the couple set guidelines with their therapist, including being home by 10 PM and not drinking with women. The husband broke the 10 PM rule, tried to stay out with a friend named Jim, and then got defensive. The author told him to come home, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate both sides. The author and her husband were working with a therapist to rebuild trust after his infidelity. The guidelines were set for a month, and the husband agreed to them. When he broke the rule, the author was firm about him following through. The husband's excuses, like it being just one guy and not drinking because the women left, might not hold up if the agreement was to be home by 10 regardless of company. The husband also tried to guilt-trip by saying Jim is mad at the author, which seems dismissive.\n\nThe author's actions seem reasonable given the context of rebuilding trust. She's holding him accountable as per their agreed terms. The husband's behavior\u2014breaking the agreement, arguing about the rules, and not taking responsibility\u2014might indicate he's not taking the process seriously. However, the author's ultimatum about returning to her family could be seen as extreme, but considering the history of affairs, it might be a justified reaction to his lack of commitment to fixing the marriage.\n\nI think the key points are the agreed-upon rules and the husband's non-compliance. The author isn't in the wrong for enforcing what they both agreed to. The husband's failure to follow through and his defensiveness make him the one at fault. So, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
