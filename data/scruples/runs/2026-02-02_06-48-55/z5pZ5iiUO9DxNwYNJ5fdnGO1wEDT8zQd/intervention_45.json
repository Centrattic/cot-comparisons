Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" scenario is in the wrong. The main issue is about the husband's affairs and the agreed-upon rules for rebuilding trust. The couple's therapist set guidelines: the husband should be home by 10 PM and avoid drinking with women. He agreed to these terms.\n\nIn the scenario, the husband goes out with friends, promises to be home by 10, but at 9:50 texts to ask if he can stay out because only one guy, \"Jim,\" is left. The author insists he come home by the agreed time to rebuild trust. They argue, and the husband comes home 45 minutes late, then dismisses her concerns and claims the rules aren't doable anymore. The author is upset because he broke his word and tried to guilt-trip her with \"Jim.\"\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to evaluate both sides. The husband violated the agreed rules, which were set in therapy to rebuild trust. His actions show a lack of accountability and respect for the agreed boundaries. The author is holding him to the standards they mutually agreed upon, which is reasonable after infidelity. The husband's excuses (like only one friend left) don't justify breaking the agreement. Trying to use \"Jim\" as a reason to stay out could be manipulative, as he was supposed to avoid situations where he might drink with women. The author's anger stems from broken trust and his refusal to follow through on commitments. \n\nThe husband's behavior\u2014arguing, whining, and dismissing the agreement\u2014undermines the therapy process. The author is not being unrealistic; they're enforcing the agreed rules. The husband's refusal to adhere to the guidelines suggests he's not committed to fixing the marriage. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong for holding him accountable. The answer should be B.\n"
