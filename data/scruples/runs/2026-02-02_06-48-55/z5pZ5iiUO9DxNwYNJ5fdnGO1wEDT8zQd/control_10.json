Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a couple dealing with infidelity. The husband has had multiple affairs, and they're working with a therapist to rebuild trust. The therapist suggested setting guidelines, like being home by 10 PM and not drinking with women. The husband agreed to these terms. Then, when he went out with friends, he wanted to stay out past 10, even though he had promised to be home by that time. The author told him to come home, and they fought. The husband broke his agreement, came home late, and even criticized the time rule. The author is upset because he broke his word and tried to use \"Jim\" as an excuse.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The husband had a history of affairs, which is a serious issue. The therapist's guidelines are part of the agreed-upon steps to rebuild trust. By agreeing to be home by 10 and not drink with women, the husband committed to these boundaries. Breaking that agreement, even once, would make it hard to regain trust. The author's reaction is about holding him accountable, which is what the therapist recommended. \n\nThe husband's actions seem dismissive. He didn't just break the rule; he argued about it and then later said the rule isn't doable. That shows a lack of commitment to the agreed terms. The author is frustrated because he's not taking the necessary steps to rebuild trust. \n\nNow, is the author being too strict? Maybe the husband feels restricted, but given the history of infidelity, strict boundaries are necessary. The author isn't being unrealistic; she's following professional advice. Her anger is justified because the husband is violating the agreed terms. \n\nThe husband's excuse about \"Jim\" trying to make her feel guilty is a bit of a manipulation tactic. The author is right to call him out on that. She's standing her ground to protect the relationship and her own trust. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. She's trying to uphold the boundaries set by the therapist to rebuild trust, which is essential after infidelity. The husband's behavior is the issue here, not the author's expectations.\n"
