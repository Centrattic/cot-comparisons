Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple working on rebuilding trust after the husband's affairs. They set guidelines in therapy: he must be home by 10 PM and not drink with women. He broke the first part by staying out past 10, then tried to justify it by saying he was with a friend named Jim and that the women had left. The author stood her ground and insisted on the agreed-upon rule.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The husband has a history of affairs, so trust is a major issue here. The guidelines were set collaboratively in therapy, which suggests they were both in agreement initially. The husband agreed to come home by 10, but then broke that commitment. His excuse about Jim and the women leaving might be a way to avoid accountability. The author's reaction\u2014expressing her needs and anger\u2014is understandable given the situation. She's trying to rebuild trust, which requires consistency.\n\nThe husband's argument about \"just one guy\" and that it's only two weeks left might minimize the importance of the rule. If he agreed to the rule for a month, breaking it right away could indicate a lack of commitment to the agreed terms. Also, his response that 10 PM isn't doable and he won't follow it anymore could show resistance to the necessary steps for the marriage's survival.\n\nThe author isn't being unreasonable; she's holding him to the promises he made for the sake of rebuilding trust. His actions and reactions seem to undermine that effort. The therapist's advice emphasized accountability, which the husband isn't showing here. The author's anger and firm stance are justified given the context of past infidelity and the need for trust-building measures.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the husband is the one in the wrong for not following through on his commitments and trying to justify his actions. The author is not wrong for enforcing the agreed-upon rules and expressing her hurt and frustration.\n"
