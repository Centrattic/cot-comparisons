Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's husband having multiple affairs and agreeing to set boundaries in therapy, like being home by 10 PM and not drinking with women. The husband breaks these rules by staying out past 10, then argues with the author, and even uses his friend \"Jim\" as an excuse. The author then threatens to leave if he doesn't commit to fixing the marriage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple was in therapy, and the guidelines were set by their therapist. The husband agreed to these guidelines, so breaking them isn't just about being late\u2014it's about not following agreed-upon terms to rebuild trust. The author is pushing back because trust is a big issue after affairs. \n\nThe husband's actions\u2014staying out later, not adhering to the rules, and arguing that the rules aren't doable\u2014show a lack of commitment to the agreed-upon steps. The author's anger stems from feeling betrayed again, especially since the husband went back on his word. The use of \"Jim\" to delay coming home could be seen as manipulative, which adds to the author's frustration. \n\nThe key points here are the agreed-upon boundaries set in therapy, the husband's violation of those, and the author's response to protect the relationship. The author isn't being unreasonable; she's enforcing the rules they both agreed to. The husband's behavior is the main issue here. The author's threat to leave if he doesn't commit is a valid expression of her feelings and boundaries. \n\nSo, looking at it from a neutral standpoint, the author isn't in the wrong. She's standing up for the terms they set to rebuild trust. The husband is the one not following through, so the answer should be B.\n"
