Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a marriage where the husband has had multiple affairs. They've been working with a therapist, and they agreed on some guidelines to rebuild trust. The main rule here was that he should be home by 10 PM. The husband went out with friends and wanted to stay out past 10, even though he had agreed to the rule. The author (the wife) told him he needs to come home by the agreed time, leading to a fight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The husband has a history of cheating, so the wife's trust is already damaged. The guidelines were set by their therapist, which means they're part of a structured plan to rebuild that trust. The husband agreed to these terms, so breaking them could be seen as a breach of trust. The wife's reaction is about enforcing the agreement they made, which is part of the therapeutic process.\n\nThe husband then tried to bend the rules by staying out later, even though he had promised not to. He also mentioned that he wouldn't drink with women, which he might have done since all the women had left. The wife is upset because he went back on his word, which is a big deal when trying to rebuild trust after infidelity. \n\nHe also used \"Jim\" as an excuse, making the wife feel guilty. That's manipulative, especially in a situation where the husband is the one who violated the agreement. The wife's anger is justified because the husband isn't following through on his commitments, which is crucial for restoring trust. \n\nThe husband's argument that 10 PM isn't doable for him and that he'll stop following the rule is undermining the agreement they both agreed on. The wife's stance is about maintaining the boundaries necessary for her to feel secure in the marriage again. \n\nConsidering all this, the wife isn't being unreasonable. The husband is the one who broke the agreed terms and is not taking the necessary steps to rebuild trust. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
