I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again.\n\nThe author is a 35-year-old woman in Colorado, where cannabis is legal. She uses edibles to relax. Her sister had to find a sitter for her 9-year-old niece, and the author agreed to take care of her. She warned her sister that the niece might get bored because there's not much kid-friendly stuff. The niece came over, and while the author was taking a shower, the niece ate some of the author's edible sour gummies that were on the dresser. The author didn't lock them up, thinking she didn't need to because she's an adult. The niece got high, which scared the author, and now she's facing backlash from her family. The author is asking if she's the asshole here.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author had edibles accessible to a child, the child ingested them, and the author didn't foresee this happening. The question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider Colorado's laws. Since cannabis is legal, but there are regulations around keeping it secure, especially around children. I think Colorado has laws requiring cannabis to be stored out of reach of children, similar to how medications are stored. If the author didn't secure the edibles properly, even though she's an adult, she might be violating those laws. That's a legal point against her.\n\nSecond, from a responsibility standpoint, when someone has a child in their care, even temporarily, they have a duty to ensure the environment is safe. The author was aware that the niece was coming over and that there might be a risk of the child finding things. Even if she didn't think about it beforehand, once the child was in her care, she should have taken steps to secure her edibles. The fact that she didn't lock them up shows negligence. She compared it to not locking up wine, but alcohol and cannabis are different. Cannabis, especially in edible form that looks like candy, is more dangerous for children and needs to be stored securely.\n\nThird, the author's family is upset because of their concern for the child's safety. The sister's reaction is understandable, and the author's parents are also critical. The author is now being blamed and excluded, which is harsh, but maybe justified given the situation. The author's own reaction was panic, which indicates she realized the severity of the situation.\n\nThe author argues that she didn't foresee this and didn't plan for it, but the fact remains that she didn't take precautions. Even if she didn't think about it, having a child in her home, especially a child who might explore and eat things, should have prompted her to secure the edibles. The comparison to wine is flawed because wine isn't as dangerous in the same way. Edibles can be more attractive to kids and have different risks.\n\nSo, considering all these factors\u2014the legal requirements, the duty of care when babysitting, the nature of the edibles, and the failure to secure them\u2014it seems that the author is in the wrong. Her actions (or inaction) led to the niece getting high, and she should have taken more responsibility for securing the edibles when she knew a child would be in her home.\n"
