I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a 35-year-old woman in Colorado who didn't lock up her edibles, leading her 9-year-old niece to get high after eating some. The author is being criticized by family, including her sister and parents, for not securing the edibles and is now being blamed and uninvited from family events.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. Colorado has legalized marijuana, including edibles, but there are still regulations about storing them safely. The author didn't lock up the sour gummies, which are edibles. The niece was left in her care due to an emergency, and the author didn't foresee a child accessing them. She panicked when it happened, called poison control, and took her to the hospital. The niece is fine, but the family is upset and blaming her.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author is responsible for not securing the edibles in a home where a child is present. Even if she didn't plan to have the child over, once she agreed to take care of her niece, she should have known the child might explore the house. The question is about negligence. In Colorado, there are laws regarding keeping cannabis out of reach of children, so not locking them up might be a legal issue as well as a moral one.\n\nThe author argues that she never locks up her wine and didn't think about this scenario. But alcohol and edibles are different; edibles can look like regular candy. The fact that the parents are now scared and uninviting her suggests a breach of trust. Even if it was accidental, the responsibility of ensuring the child's safety while in her care likely falls on her. She's being blamed for not taking precautions, even if she didn't anticipate it. So, the answer would lean towards A, she's in the wrong because she didn't secure the edibles, which are accessible to a child, leading to an avoidable incident.\n"
