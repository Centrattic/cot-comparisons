I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not locking up edibles, leading her niece to get high. The situation is in Colorado where edibles are legal.\n\nFirst, the author is an adult who uses edibles for relaxation. She had a 9-year-old niece over because her sister needed a sitter. The niece ended up eating the edibles left on the dresser. The key points here are whether the author was negligent in not securing the edibles, especially with a child present.\n\nThe author claims she didn't think about locking them up because she's a responsible adult and didn't foresee the incident. However, the niece was a child in her care, so maybe there's an expectation to secure substances that could harm a minor. Even if the author didn't intentionally plan it, the responsibility of hosting a child might require extra precautions. \n\nIn many places, there are laws about keeping cannabis products away from children. Colorado likely has similar regulations. If the author didn't follow those, she could be at fault. Also, the sister and parents are upset because they feel the child was in danger. The author's argument is that she didn't lock up the edibles the same way she wouldn't lock up wine, but edibles look like candy, so the risk is higher for children. \n\nThe answer might hinge on whether the author took reasonable precautions. Leaving edibles in an accessible place when a child is present might be considered negligent, regardless of prior habits. Even if unintended, the outcome was the child ingesting them, which could lead to liability. The author's actions (or inaction) directly contributed to the incident. So, while not malicious, it's a failure to ensure the child's safety. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
