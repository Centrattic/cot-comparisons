I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not locking up edibles, leading her niece to get high. The situation is in Colorado where cannabis is legal.\n\nFirst, the author had edibles on her dresser, which were accessible to a 9-year-old. Even if she didn't think about it beforehand, the reality is that children can get into things if not secured. The key point here is the legal responsibility of possessing cannabis products. Colorado law requires that cannabis products be stored safely to prevent access by children. So from a legal standpoint, the author might have violated storage laws.\n\nThen there's the ethical angle. The author is an adult who chose to consume cannabis products in her home. She should have foreseen that if a child were present, there's a risk of accidental ingestion. She did mention having no kid-friendly activities, which might imply she didn't fully consider the environment's safety. Even if she didn't lock up wine, edibles are a different scenario because they're psychoactive and can be mistaken for candy.\n\nThe parents and family are upset, which shows the severity of the situation. The niece is fine, but the incident could have been much worse. The author's lack of preparation and the consequences of her actions (family backlash, being blamed) suggest that she's in the wrong. She should have taken precautions, regardless of prior experiences. So, while it's an accident, the responsibility lies with her to ensure the environment is safe for a child on her premises.\n"
