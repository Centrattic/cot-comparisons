I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not locking up edibles, which led to her niece getting high. The situation is in Colorado where cannabis is legal.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is an adult who uses edibles for relaxation. She didn't lock them up because she considered them similar to wine, which she wouldn't lock away. However, she had a 9-year-old over for childcare. The niece found and consumed the edibles, leading to the incident.\n\nThe key points here are responsibility and reasonable precautions. Even though the author didn't intentionally leave them out, the fact that a child was present means she should have been more cautious. In states where cannabis is legal, there are often laws about keeping it secure to prevent access by minors. For example, Colorado likely has regulations requiring cannabis products to be stored out of reach of children. \n\nThe author's reasoning that she wouldn't lock up wine is a bit of a red herring. Wine isn't typically a controlled substance, and while it's not advisable to leave it around kids, the legal and safety standards for cannabis are higher. The author's oversight led to a dangerous situation, even if unintended. \n\nThe niece being okay is a relief, but the fact remains that the author didn't take necessary precautions. The family's reaction, including blame and uninvites, stems from the fear and stress of the situation. The author's parents and sister are concerned for good reason\u2014child safety is paramount. \n\nEven if the author didn't foresee the incident, the responsibility still lies with her to ensure her home is safe for the child in her care. The argument that she didn't do it on purpose doesn't negate the need for reasonable safety measures. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong because she didn't take appropriate steps to secure the edibles, which are a controlled substance, when a child was present. It's about legal responsibility and child safety, not just intent.\n"
