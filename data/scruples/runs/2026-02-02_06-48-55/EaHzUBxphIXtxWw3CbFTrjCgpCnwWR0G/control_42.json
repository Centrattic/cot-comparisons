I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The author left her edibles unlocked, and her niece, who was left in her care, ate some. The main issue here is whether she's responsible for not securing the edibles properly.\n\nFirst, the author is in Colorado where marijuana is legal. She's an adult who uses edibles for relaxation. Her sister had to leave her 9-year-old niece with her. The niece, being a child, probably didn't understand the risks of the edibles. The author didn't childproof her home, assuming maybe that a child wouldn't be there. But since the niece was there, the author's responsibility comes into play.\n\nThe key points here are child safety and reasonable precautions. Even if the author didn't expect the child to access the edibles, once a child is in her care, she should have taken steps to secure items that could be harmful. Edibles, especially in the form of candy, can be mistaken by children. The author compared it to wine, but alcohol is different because it's not as appealing to kids in a candy form. Edibles, especially gummies, look like snacks, so the risk is higher.\n\nThe author's defense is that she didn't plan for the child to be there and didn't think about locking them up. But the fact that she had a child in her home who isn't hers means she should have been more cautious. Parents and guardians are responsible for ensuring the environment is safe for children, even if it's unexpected. The parents are upset because their child was exposed to something harmful, and the blame is partly due to the author's oversight.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't intend harm, and the niece is fine. The situation wasn't malicious. However, the responsibility of ensuring a safe environment is on the person in charge of the child. Even if it's a last-minute arrangement, the author should have taken precautions. The comparison to wine isn't valid because the edibles are more dangerous when in the form of candy.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is in the wrong because she didn't secure the edibles properly, leading to the child's accidental consumption. Even if it was unintentional, the failure to take necessary precautions makes her responsible.\n"
