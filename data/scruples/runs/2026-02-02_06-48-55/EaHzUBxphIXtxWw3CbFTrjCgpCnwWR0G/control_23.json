I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that she let her 9-year-old niece stay at her house, and the niece ate some edibles that weren't locked up, causing her to get high. The author is in Colorado, where weed is legal, but the question is whether she's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to think about what's expected when someone has a child in their home. Even though the author is an adult who uses edibles, the presence of a child changes the responsibility. The key point is whether she should have secured the edibles. The post mentions she didn't lock them up because she thought she didn't need to, similar to how she wouldn't lock up wine. But children aren't necessarily aware that edibles are dangerous, and unlike alcohol, which is regulated and not given to minors, edibles might look like regular candy. \n\nIn Colorado, there are regulations about storing cannabis products safely. The law requires cannabis to be kept out of reach of children and locked in a child-resistant container. If the author didn't follow these laws, she could be legally responsible. Even if she didn't know, the responsibility is on the adult to secure the substances. \n\nAlso, the sister left the child in her care, so the author had a duty of care. Not securing the edibles could be seen as negligence. The family's reaction is understandable given the potential risk. The author might not have intended harm, but her oversight led to the incident. \n\nSo, even in a legal context where cannabis is permitted, there are specific safety measures. Failing to follow them when a child is present likely makes her at fault. The author's defense that she didn't foresee the problem doesn't negate the responsibility to take precautions. Therefore, the answer would be that she is in the wrong (Answer A).\n"
