I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe author is a 35-year-old woman in Colorado where recreational cannabis is legal. She likes to use edibles to unwind. Her sister had an emergency and needed to find a sitter for her 9-year-old niece. The author offered to help but warned the sister that the niece might get bored because her place isn't kid-friendly. After leaving the niece with some books, the author went to take a shower. Later, she noticed the niece was unusually quiet and found her on the couch, staring at the ceiling. The niece admitted to eating the sour gummies from the dresser. The author panicked, called poison control and her sister, and everyone else is blaming her now. The niece ended up being fine, even fell asleep after eating a grilled cheese and hotdogs, and watching a movie. The author is being uninvited from places where the niece is present because people think she might have planned it. The author is feeling awful but doesn't think she's an asshole for this, as it wasn't intentional.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). The user thinks the author is in the wrong but is curious about the other perspective.\n\nFirst, let's consider the legal aspect. Colorado has strict laws about keeping cannabis products out of reach of children. The author didn't lock up the edibles, which are in a state where they're legal. However, the law requires that they be stored in a secure, locked container to prevent access by children. So, legally, she might have violated that. But the user is asking about moral or social wrong, not just legal.\n\nNext, the context: the niece is 9 years old. The author was aware the child was coming over. She even said her place isn't kid-friendly, implying she might not have the usual child-proofing. The edibles were on the dresser, which is an area a child could access. The author didn't consider that even though she's an adult and doesn't have kids, a visiting child could reach them. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that she didn't think about it because she's a grown woman and not a parent, similar to how she wouldn't lock up wine. But the issue here is that the niece was a child in her care. Even if the author isn't a parent, when someone else's child is in your home, you have a responsibility to ensure the environment is safe. Leaving potentially harmful substances in a place a child could reach is negligent, regardless of the author's personal habits.\n\nThe family is reacting strongly because they believe the author should have taken precautions. The parents might feel that she didn't consider the child's safety, which is a serious matter. Even though the child is fine, the act of not securing the edibles could lead to more severe consequences if repeated. The author's admission that she didn't foresee this happening suggests a lack of awareness or consideration, which is the crux of the issue.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't intentionally harm the child. The situation was an accident. But the key is the responsibility when someone else's child is in your home. The fact that she was a temporary caregiver and didn't secure the edibles despite knowing the child was there could be seen as a failure in that responsibility.\n\nSo, even though the author didn't plan for the child to take the edibles, the act of not securing them when she knew a child was present is a mistake. The family's reaction, while harsh, is about protecting the child and holding her accountable for safety. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because she didn't take reasonable precautions to prevent the accident, even if it wasn't intentional.\n"
