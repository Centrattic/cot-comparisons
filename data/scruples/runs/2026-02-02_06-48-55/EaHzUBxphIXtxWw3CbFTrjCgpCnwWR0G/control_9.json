I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if the author is in the wrong for not locking up edibles, leading to her niece getting high. The author lives in Colorado where marijuana is legal. She's a 35-year-old woman who uses edibles for relaxation. Her sister needed a sitter for her 9-year-old niece, and the author agreed to help. She warned the sister that the niece might get bored because there's not much kid-friendly stuff. The niece ate the edibles left on the dresser, which the author didn't lock up. The author panicked, called poison control, and the niece ended up fine but fell asleep. The family is blaming her, and the author is feeling uninvited from places with the niece.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. In Colorado, marijuana is legal, but there are regulations about keeping it out of reach of children. The state likely has laws requiring edibles to be stored securely, similar to how medications are handled. If the author didn't lock up the edibles, she might be violating those laws, even if unintentionally. \n\nSecond, the responsibility aspect. The niece is a minor, and the author is an adult who knew the child was coming over. Even if the author didn't think about it beforehand, once she knew the niece was in the house, she should have been aware of the potential risk. The fact that she didn't lock up the edibles suggests negligence, especially considering the possible consequences. \n\nThird, the reaction from the family. The sister and parents are upset, which is understandable. The author's sister in particular seems to have been in panic, which indicates the severity they perceive the situation. The author's own admission that she didn't foresee this happening might not be a strong defense because it's a common oversight to not consider a child's access to such items, especially when they're in a visible place like a dresser. \n\nThe author's argument is that she didn't plan to harm the niece and thought of edibles similarly to wine, which isn't stored securely. However, edibles can be more dangerous for children due to the delayed effects and the potential for overdose. The author's lack of foresight in this case could be seen as a failure to act responsibly, given that she's an adult in a situation where a child is present. \n\nEven if the niece is fine, the fact that the incident happened at all could lead to legal repercussions. Colorado might hold the author responsible for not securing the edibles properly. Additionally, the family's reaction, including being blamed for potential future issues, seems to stem from the fact that this incident could have been prevented with proper precautions.\n\nConsidering all these points, the author did have a responsibility to secure the edibles when she knew a child would be in the house. Her failure to do so, regardless of intent, constitutes negligence. Therefore, she is in the wrong.\n"
