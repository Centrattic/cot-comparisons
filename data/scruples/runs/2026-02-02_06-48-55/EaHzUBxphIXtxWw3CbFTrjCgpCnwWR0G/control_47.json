I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that she had edibles in her house, didn't lock them up, and her niece ended up eating some. The main question is whether she's at fault.\n\nFirst, the author lives in Colorado where edibles are legal. She has them in her home and uses them for relaxation. When her sister needed a sitter, she agreed to take the 9-year-old niece. She mentioned that she didn't think there would be an issue because the kid would be bored, but she had the edibles on her dresser. The niece took them, ate some, and got high. The author claims she didn't foresee this and that she panicked and took care of the child afterwards.\n\nNow, the key points to consider are: Did she take any precautions to keep the edibles away from the child? The answer is no; she didn't lock them up. She compared it to leaving wine around, but a 9-year-old might not access a bottle of wine placed out, but edibles that look like candy could be tempting. \n\nEven though she didn't intend for it to happen, the fact that she didn't secure the edibles in a child-proof manner could be seen as negligence. Parents and guardians are generally expected to make their homes safe for children, especially when hosting them. The parents and family are upset because they feel she didn't take necessary precautions. \n\nThe author's defense is that she didn't plan for this, but responsibility isn't just about intent\u2014it's also about foreseeable risks. A 9-year-old in a home with visible edibles is a foreseeable situation where the child might take them. Therefore, not securing them could be considered negligent, making the author at fault. \n\nAlso, the consequences were that the niece was under the influence, which is a serious matter. Even if the child was fine, the act of allowing access to a controlled substance (even legal) to a minor could be seen as irresponsible. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author probably is in the wrong because she didn't take steps to prevent access to the edibles, which were a risk to the child. The answer would be A.\n"
