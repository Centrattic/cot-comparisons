I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not locking up edibles, leading her 9-year-old niece to consume them and get high. The author is in Colorado where cannabis is legal.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal perspective. Even though cannabis is legal in Colorado, it's still a controlled substance, and there are laws about keeping it out of reach of children. So maybe the author violated some child safety regulations by not securing the edibles. That could be a point against her.\n\nNext, the responsibility aspect. The niece was a minor in the care of the author. Even if the author didn't think about it beforehand, once she knew a child was coming over, maybe she should have taken precautions. The author compared it to wine, but alcohol and cannabis are different in terms of regulation and potential harm to kids. Wine is legal for adults, but even then, you might not leave it out where a child could access it. However, edibles are more dangerous because they look like regular candy. The fact that the niece ate several sour gummies suggests they were easily accessible and possibly mistaken for regular candy.\n\nThe reaction from the family and friends is also a factor. The sister and parents are upset because they feel the author was negligent. The author's own admission that she didn't think about locking them up shows a lack of foresight, even if unintentional. The niece was left unsupervised for a bit when the author took a shower, which might have contributed to the incident. \n\nFrom a general safety standpoint, even if the author never had issues before, having a child in her home for the first time should have prompted her to secure any potentially harmful substances. The author's defense that she treats edibles like wine isn't valid because the edibles pose a different risk to children. Plus, the author herself felt awful and took steps to help the niece after, which shows some responsibility, but doesn't negate the initial negligence.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author made a mistake by not securing the edibles, especially knowing a child was present. Even if it wasn't intentional, there's a responsibility to ensure the safety of children under one's care. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
