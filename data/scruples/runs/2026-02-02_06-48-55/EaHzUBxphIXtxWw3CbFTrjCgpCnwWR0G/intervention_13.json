I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not locking up edibles, leading her niece to get high. The situation involves a 9-year-old in Colorado where marijuana is legal.\n\nFirst, the author had edibles on her dresser, which she didn't lock up. The niece ate some and got high. The author's argument is that she's a responsible adult and didn't foresee the situation, similar to how she wouldn't lock up wine. But the parents and others are upset, blaming her for not securing the edibles properly.\n\nI need to consider Colorado's laws regarding edibles and child safety. In many places, especially where cannabis is legal, there are specific laws about keeping it out of reach of children. For example, Colorado might require cannabis products to be stored in child-resistant packaging or locked up. If the author didn't follow those laws, she could be legally at fault. But I'm not sure about the exact regulations here.\n\nEven if there's no law, from a common-sense perspective, a 9-year-old visiting a home should have any potentially harmful substances, including edibles, secured. Adults are generally expected to know that kids might explore and access items left out. The author's response that she treats edibles like wine is a key point. Wine is not a controlled substance, and a child consuming it would be a different scenario, but edibles are a controlled substance with potential for overconsumption and adverse effects.\n\nThe niece ended up fine, but the risk was there. The author admitted she didn't think about it, which shows a lack of consideration for the child's safety. Even if it wasn't intentional, negligence can still make someone responsible. The family's reaction is also valid because the incident could have had worse consequences.\n\nSo, while the author didn't intend harm, her failure to secure the edibles, despite knowing a child was present, likely makes her at fault. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
