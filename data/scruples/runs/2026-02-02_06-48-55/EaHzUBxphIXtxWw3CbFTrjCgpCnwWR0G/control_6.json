I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a 35-year-old woman in Colorado who didn't lock up her edibles, leading her 9-year-old niece to consume them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Colorado has laws about keeping cannabis products secure from children. The author might be violating those laws by not securing the edibles, which are in a place accessible to a child. Even though she didn't lock them up, maybe she should have known about the legal requirements regarding child safety with cannabis. \n\nNext, the practical aspect. The niece is a child, and edibles can be dangerous for them. The author's reasoning that she didn't lock them up because she's an adult and doesn't need to worry about that seems flawed. Children are naturally curious and might not understand the risks, so it's the adult's responsibility to keep such items out of reach. The fact that the niece ended up eating them shows that the author's approach was insufficient. \n\nAlso, the author's family is upset, and she's being blamed. While she didn't intend harm, the consequences were real. The parents might feel that she should have been more cautious. The author's argument that she treated it like wine might not hold because edibles are different\u2014children can't consume alcohol, but they can accidentally consume cannabis edibles. \n\nHowever, the author didn't act maliciously. She might have underestimated the risk. But responsibility comes into play here. Even if it's an oversight, the fact that the child had access to the edibles is a problem. \n\nIn conclusion, even though the author didn't mean to cause harm, the lack of precaution in securing the edibles in the presence of a child likely makes her responsible. So the answer would be A, she's in the wrong.\n"
