I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that their niece ate edibles that weren't locked up, leading her to get high. The author is in Colorado where edibles are legal, and they didn't think to lock them up because they consider themselves a responsible adult, comparing it to not locking up wine.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and societal expectations. In a place where cannabis is legal, there are often strict rules about storing it safely, especially around children. Colorado probably has laws about keeping cannabis products out of reach of children. If the author didn't follow those laws, that could be a point against them.\n\nThe niece is 9 years old. Even if the author didn't have kids before, when a child is in their care, they should assume responsibility for the environment. The author knew the niece was coming over, even if it was an emergency. They mentioned the home isn't kid-friendly, but didn't think about the edibles. That seems like a lapse in judgment.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they wouldn't lock up wine, implying that edibles are similar. But edibles are different because they can be more appealing to kids and the effects are different. Wine is not legal for kids, but even if an adult has wine, they still store it safely. Plus, the legal aspect here is that even though it's legal for adults, there are specific storage laws for cannabis products.\n\nThe author's family is blaming them, which makes sense because the incident was preventable. The sister was horrified, and the author was uninvited from events. The author's defense is that they didn't plan it, but negligence is a factor here. Did they foresee the risk? Maybe not, but not foreseeing a risk doesn't negate responsibility. If you have a substance that's dangerous when accessed by kids, it's on you to secure it.\n\nSo, in terms of responsibility, even if it was an accident, the author didn't take necessary precautions. The answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they failed to secure a harmful substance that a child could access, leading to harm (even if minor). Society generally expects adults to anticipate such risks when children are present.\n"
