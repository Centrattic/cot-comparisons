I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves her niece eating edibles that weren't locked up, leading to the kid getting high. The author is in Colorado where marijuana is legal. She's a 35-year-old who uses edibles to unwind. Her sister needed a sitter for her 9-year-old, so she offered to babysit. She warned her sister the kid might be bored. The niece ate the sour gummies from her dresser when she was in the shower.\n\nThe author didn't lock them up because she didn't think about it, assuming she didn't need to. After the incident, she panicked, called poison control and the mom, apologized a lot. Now her sister and parents are blaming her, uninviting her from events with the niece, and saying she might plan to harm the kid next. The author feels awful but doesn't think she's an asshole.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Let's break it down. Colorado law requires cannabis products to be stored securely to prevent access by children. Even if she didn't think about it, the law might hold her responsible. Also, as a caretaker, she had a duty to ensure the environment is safe for the child. The fact that she didn't take precautions could be seen as negligence. However, she didn't intend to harm the child and was unaware of the risk. The key points here are legal responsibility, duty of care, and whether foreseeable risks were ignored.\n\nEven if she didn't plan it, the responsibility of storing edibles safely is on the person in possession. The fact that she had a 9-year-old in her home and didn't implement child-proofing measures for something that's a known risk (especially in a legal state where such precautions are necessary) might make her legally and morally at fault. The parents might be overreacting, but the core issue is her failure to secure the edibles. So, even if it was an accident, she's still in the wrong because she didn't take necessary safety steps.\n"
