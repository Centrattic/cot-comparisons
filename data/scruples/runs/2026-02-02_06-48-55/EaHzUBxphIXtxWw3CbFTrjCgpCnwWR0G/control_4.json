I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for not locking up their edibles, which their 9-year-old niece consumed. They live in Colorado where marijuana is legal. The key points here are about responsibility and safety, especially regarding children.\n\nFirst, the author had edibles in their home, which they didn't lock up. They mentioned that they didn't think about it because they're an adult and didn't expect a child to access them. However, they were the ones who agreed to babysit the niece, even though they knew the home wasn't kid-friendly. The niece ended up eating several gummies, leading to her getting high. \n\nThe main question is whether the author is at fault. Colorado has strict laws about marijuana, especially concerning minors. I think the law requires that cannabis products be stored out of reach of children. Even if the author didn't have a history of children in their home, once they took in a child, they should have ensured the environment was safe. The parents and sister are upset because the author didn't take precautions, which led to the child consuming edibles. \n\nAlso, the author's reasoning that edibles are like wine and don't need to be locked up is flawed. Wine isn't psychoactive in the same way, and there's a different legal standard for cannabis. The parents' concerns about future safety make sense, leading to the uninvites. The author's oversight, while unintentional, resulted in a dangerous situation. So, even though they panicked and handled it well, the initial negligence in not securing the edibles likely makes them at least partially at fault.\n"
