I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not locking up her edibles, leading her niece to get high. The situation is in Colorado, where marijuana is legal.\n\nFirst, the author had edibles out, specifically sour gummies, which are presumably cannabis-infused. She had a 9-year-old at her house, and the child ate several of them. The author didn't lock them up, assuming she didn't need to since she's an adult and hadn't had issues before. But when the niece got high, she called poison control and the sister, and now the author is facing backlash from family.\n\nNow, thinking about Colorado's laws. Even though marijuana is legal for adults, there are regulations about keeping it secure, especially around children. Colorado's law requires that cannabis products be stored out of reach of children. If a child accesses it, there could be legal consequences, even if the child is a family member. The author might be violating this law by not securing the edibles.\n\nAlso, from a common sense perspective, when a child is in your care, you're responsible for their safety. The author knew the niece was coming over and even warned the sister her place wasn't kid-friendly. But she didn't take steps to secure the edibles. The fact that she didn't consider the risk shows negligence. Even if it wasn't intentional, the outcome could have been serious. The niece was fine this time, but what if it was a different scenario? The author's responsibility is to ensure the environment is safe for the child in her care.\n\nFamily reactions are harsh, but the author's mistake is in not foreseeing the possibility. The parents are right in pointing out the need for safe storage. The author's argument that she treats edibles like wine is flawed because alcohol is different\u2014children aren't supposed to consume it, but edibles, especially in gummy form, look like candy. A child might not know the difference, making secure storage even more critical.\n\nSo, considering legal aspects, responsibility for the child's safety, and the potential severity of the situation, the author is in the wrong. Even if it was an accident, the failure to secure the edibles was a preventable oversight.\n"
