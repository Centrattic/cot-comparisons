I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not locking up her edibles, leading her niece to get high.\n\nFirst, the facts: The author lives in Colorado where cannabis is legal. She has edibles that she keeps on her dresser, not locked up. Her 9-year-old niece came over for a babysitting situation, and during a time when the author wasn't present (showering), the niece ate some of the edibles. The author didn't foresee this and panicked once it happened. The niece ended up fine, but the family is upset, blaming her, and she's been uninvited from places where the niece will be.\n\nNow, considering Colorado's laws. Even though cannabis is legal for adults, there are specific regulations regarding keeping it away from children. Colorado law requires cannabis products to be stored securely to prevent access by minors. So, if the author didn't lock up the edibles, she might be violating state law. The fact that the niece had access and consumed them could be seen as the author's failure to follow these safety measures.\n\nFrom a responsibility standpoint, even if the author didn't think about it, the key point is that she had a child in her care. As a caregiver, there's an expectation to take precautions to ensure the child's safety. Edibles, especially in forms like gummy candies, can look like regular candy to a child. Not securing them could be seen as negligence, regardless of intent. The author's argument that she didn't lock up edibles because she's an adult and didn't expect a child to be there might not hold up because once a child is in the environment, the responsibility shifts to ensuring the space is safe for them.\n\nHowever, she did have her sister's child over, and maybe the sister was aware of the author's edibles. But even if the sister knew, the author still has a duty of care once the child is in her home. The fact that the niece was left unsupervised for a while (the author was in the shower) contributes to the situation. The author's lack of foresight is a problem here. While it's true that the child ended up fine, the potential risk was significant. THC can have serious effects on children, even if in this case it wasn't severe.\n\nThe family's reaction, while harsh, is understandable given the situation. The author's admission that she didn't lock them up because she didn't consider the risk shows a lack of awareness of the dangers. Legally and ethically, there's a responsibility to secure substances that could harm children, especially when they're under your care, even temporarily.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author likely is in the wrong. The answer would be A.\n"
