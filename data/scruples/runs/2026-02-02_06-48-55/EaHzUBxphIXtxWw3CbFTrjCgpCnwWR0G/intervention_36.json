I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not locking up edibles, leading her niece to get high. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author, a 35-year-old woman, didn't lock up her edibles. Her 9-year-old niece ended up eating some and getting high. The author claims she didn't foresee this, but others are blaming her. \n\nIn Colorado, where marijuana is legal, there are laws about keeping cannabis products out of reach of children. The author mentions that she didn't lock the edibles up, thinking she's an adult and doesn't need to worry about that. But the problem here is that she had a child in her house. Even if she didn't think about it before, once the niece was there, the responsibility to secure the edibles falls on her.\n\nEdibles, especially in the form of candy, can be mistaken by kids. The author's mistake was not securing something that's clearly child-accessible. Even if she didn't intend for it to happen, the lack of foresight is an issue. \n\nThe reactions from her sister and others are harsh, but the core issue is the author's negligence in not making her environment safe for a child. While the niece is fine, the act of leaving edibles accessible to a child is a safety risk. \n\nSo, even though the author didn't mean harm, the responsibility lies with her to ensure the child's safety once she agreed to watch her. The fact that the edibles were in a place a child could reach without supervision is a key point here. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because she didn't take necessary precautions to protect the child under her care.\n"
