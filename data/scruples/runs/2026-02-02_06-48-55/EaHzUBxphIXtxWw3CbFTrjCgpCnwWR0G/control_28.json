I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author here is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a 35-year-old woman in Colorado where cannabis is legal. She uses edibles to unwind. Her sister had an emergency and needed a sitter for her 9-year-old niece. The author agreed to take the niece, even though she warned that there aren't many kid-friendly things. The niece ended up eating some of the author's sour gummy edibles that were on her dresser, not locked up. The author didn't think about locking them because she considered herself an adult and didn't foresee the risk. The niece got high, and the author panicked, called poison control, and apologized a lot. The niece is fine now, but the sister and even the author's parents are blaming her, and she's been uninvited from places where the niece is present.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (Yes) or B (No).\n\nFirst, let me consider the legal aspect. In Colorado, cannabis is legal, but the possession and use of cannabis around children is still a sensitive issue. Even though the author is an adult and the state allows it, the presence of edible products in a home where a child might access them could be a problem. Colorado has laws about keeping cannabis products out of reach of children. I think there's a law that requires cannabis products to be stored in a locked container to prevent access by children. If the author didn't follow that law, she could be legally at fault. \n\nNext, the responsibility aspect. The author was in the position of a caretaker for her niece, even if temporarily. As a responsible adult, especially when someone else's child is in your care, you should take precautions to ensure their safety. The author acknowledges that she didn't lock up the edibles, which were in a place accessible to the child. Even though she didn't intend for this to happen, the fact that she didn't take reasonable steps to prevent it (like locking up the edibles) could be seen as negligence. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that she treats her edibles like wine, which isn't something she would lock up. However, a 9-year-old child might not understand the difference between candy and edibles. The sour gummies being in a place where a child could find them (on the dresser) is a significant oversight. The author's defense is that she didn't foresee it, but not foreseeing the risk doesn't negate the responsibility to take precautions once a child is present. \n\nThe reaction from the sister and parents seems harsh, but the core issue is about the author's judgment in keeping the edibles accessible. Even if the niece is fine, the act of allowing a child to ingest something she shouldn't is a big mistake. The author's own parents are criticizing her, which suggests that there's a societal expectation to keep such substances out of reach, regardless of her personal habits. \n\nAlso, the author was given a child to care for, even if temporarily. That responsibility includes ensuring the environment is safe. Not childproofing the home in this context is a lapse in judgment. While the author didn't plan to harm the niece, the negligence in not securing the edibles is a key point. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author didn't intend for the incident to happen, her failure to take basic safety precautions (like locking up the edibles) when a child was in her care makes her at least partially responsible. The law in Colorado likely requires secure storage, and common sense dictates that when a child is present, you should secure any substances that could be harmful if ingested by accident. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
