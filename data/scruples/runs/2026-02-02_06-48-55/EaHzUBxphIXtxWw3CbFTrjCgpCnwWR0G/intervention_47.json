I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down the situation here. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The key points are that she left edibles on her dresser, which her 9-year-old niece ate, leading to her getting high. The author didn't lock them up, thinking she didn't need to because she's an adult. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal context. Colorado has laws about keeping cannabis products secure, especially from children. Even though edibles might look like regular candy, the law likely requires them to be stored safely. The author's niece is a child, so the responsibility to prevent access is higher.\n\nThen there's the practical aspect. A 9-year-old can reach a dresser, especially if it's accessible. The author mentions that her home isn't kid-friendly, but she still had the edibles out. Maybe she didn't consider the risks because she's used to being alone, but when a child is present, the situation changes. The parents trusted her to take care of the child, so she should have taken precautions.\n\nEmotionally, the author is feeling blamed, but the family's reaction is understandable. The niece could have been seriously harmed. Even though she ended up okay, the potential for harm is significant. The author's defense that she didn't think about it is a common excuse but doesn't absolve her responsibility.\n\nLegal and safety standards probably require proper storage. The fact that she used a phrase like \"I didn't foresee this\" shows a lack of foresight. Parents and guardians are expected to take reasonable steps to secure harmful substances. Leaving edibles in a place a child can reach isn't reasonable.\n\nSo, even if the author didn't intend harm, she neglected her duty to ensure the child's safety. The answer here is likely that she's in the wrong (A).\n"
