I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not locking up her edibles, leading her niece to get high. The situation is in Colorado where cannabis is legal. The author is 35, and the niece is 9 years old.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the responsibility here. The author had edibles in her home, which she didn't lock up. She mentioned she's a 35-year-old woman who doesn't usually need to lock things up because she's an adult. But she was babysitting her niece, a child, for her sister. The key issue is whether she should have taken precautions to prevent the child from accessing the edibles.\n\nIn many places, especially where cannabis is legal, there are laws about keeping cannabis products secure to prevent access by children. For example, Colorado probably has child-resistant packaging laws, but even beyond that, when there's a child in the home, it's prudent to store such items safely. The author didn't consider that the child might find them, even though she warned the sister the kid might be bored. The fact that the child found the edibles on the dresser suggests that the placement was accessible.\n\nThe author's defense is that she didn't think it would happen, similar to not locking up wine. But edibles are different because they can look like regular candy, especially sour gummies. A child might not realize they're not safe. The parents and sister are upset because she didn't secure them, which led to the niece consuming them. Even though the niece is fine, the situation could have been more dangerous.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, Colorado's law likely requires safe storage of cannabis products. If the author didn't follow those laws, she might be liable. Ethically, when someone else's child is in your care, you should take all reasonable steps to ensure their safety. The author didn't take those steps, so she's at least partially responsible. Even if it was an accident, the lack of precaution is a mistake. So, the answer would be A, yes, she's in the wrong because she should have known better and failed to secure the edibles properly when a child was present.\n"
