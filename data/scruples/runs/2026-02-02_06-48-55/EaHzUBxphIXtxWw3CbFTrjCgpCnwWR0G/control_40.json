I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the given situation. The scenario is about a woman in Colorado who left edibles unlocked, and her 9-year-old niece got high from them. The author argues she didn't foresee the problem, comparing it to not locking up wine, and feels unfairly blamed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider Colorado's laws. Since it's legal, but there are regulations about keeping edibles out of reach of children. The key point here is the responsibility of the person in possession. Even though it's legal, there's a duty to store them safely, especially when a child is present. The author had a 9-year-old over, so she should have been aware of the risk. \n\nThe author says she didn't lock them up because she's an adult and didn't think about it. But having a child in the house changes the responsibility. The comparison to wine isn't the same because alcohol isn't typically left out in the open in a way a child could access. Edibles, especially in candy form, look like regular food. The parents are upset because she didn't secure them, which is a valid safety concern. \n\nEven though the niece is fine, the act of leaving them accessible is negligent. Colorado's laws likely require secure storage to prevent access by minors. The author's defense that she didn't plan for this doesn't absolve her of responsibility. The family's reactions\u2014uninviting her, blaming her\u2014are more about the risk she took. \n\nSo, while the outcome wasn't intentional, the failure to secure the edibles, knowing a child was present, makes the author at least partially at fault. The answer would be A (Yes, she's in the wrong) because she didn't take necessary precautions, which is the core issue here.\n"
