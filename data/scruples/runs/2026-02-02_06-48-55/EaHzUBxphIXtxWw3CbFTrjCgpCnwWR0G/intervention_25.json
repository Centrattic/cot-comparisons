I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about someone in Colorado who left their edibles unsecured, and their 9-year-old niece accidentally consumed them. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, Colorado has strict laws regarding cannabis, including edibles. Even though it's legal, there are regulations about storing cannabis products safely to prevent access by minors. The author mentions that they didn't lock up the edibles, which are in a location (dresser) that a child could access. The niece ate several of them, leading to a panic.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) the legal responsibility to store cannabis products securely, especially in a home where children might be present, and 2) the foreseeability of a child accessing the edibles. The author's defense is that they never locked up edibles before, comparing it to not locking up wine. But a 9-year-old child isn't the same as an adult, so the risk of a child accessing something left out is much higher. \n\nEven if the author didn't intend for this to happen, the fact remains that they didn't take reasonable precautions. The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment requires that cannabis products be stored in a child-resistant container and out of reach of children. Failing to do so can lead to legal consequences. \n\nAdditionally, the author had knowledge of the niece being present, albeit temporarily, and should have been aware of the risks. The sister's husband had an emergency, leading to the niece's unexpected stay. But the author should have considered that any time a child is in their home, there's a potential risk, especially with substances that can be mistaken for regular candy.\n\nThe reactions from family members are understandable given the potential dangers of a child consuming potent cannabis edibles. Even if the niece ended up fine, the incident could have had severe consequences. The parents and family's blame stems from the author's negligence in securing the edibles, which is a safety responsibility regardless of intent.\n\nSo, while the author didn't mean to harm the niece, the failure to secure the edibles in a child-safe manner constitutes negligence under both legal and common-sense standards. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
