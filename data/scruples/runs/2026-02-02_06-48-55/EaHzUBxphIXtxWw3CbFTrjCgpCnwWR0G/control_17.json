I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by understanding the situation. The author is a 35-year-old woman in Colorado where cannabis is legal. She had her 9-year-old niece over because the sister needed a sitter. The niece ate some edibles that were left on the dresser, which made her high. The author didn't lock them up, assuming maybe that they were safe, like how she might leave wine out.\n\nFirst, I should consider Colorado's laws regarding cannabis and edibles. Since it's legal, but possession and storage might have specific guidelines, especially around children. I think there are laws requiring secure storage to prevent access by minors. If the author didn't secure the edibles, even unintentionally, she might be violating those laws. \n\nThen, the responsibility aspect. The niece is a child, so the author had a duty to ensure the environment was safe. Even if she didn't think about it, leaving edibles accessible could be seen as negligence. Adults are generally expected to take precautions when there are children around. The sister might have trusted her, but if there's a legal obligation to secure edibles, not doing so could be her fault.\n\nAlso, the family's reaction seems harsh, but maybe they have a point. If the author had the edibles in a place a child could reach, it's on her to prevent access. The parents and sister might be right in blaming her because their child was harmed, even temporarily. The fact that the niece is fine is good, but the incident still shows a lapse in judgment.\n\nHowever, there's a counterpoint: she didn't do it intentionally. She might not have considered the risk, thinking it was a temporary situation. But negligence doesn't require intent; it's about failing to take necessary precautions. Colorado's laws likely require secure storage, so even if she didn't mean to, she's in violation.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's mistake was not securing the edibles, leading to the niece's ingestion. Legally and in terms of responsibility, she might be at fault. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
