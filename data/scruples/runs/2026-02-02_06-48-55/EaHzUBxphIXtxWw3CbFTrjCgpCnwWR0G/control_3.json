I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not locking up edibles, which led her niece to get high. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author lives in Colorado where marijuana is legal. She has edibles in her home, which she uses for relaxation. Her sister drops off her 9-year-old niece, and the child eats the edibles left on a dresser. The author didn't lock them up, assuming she's an adult who doesn't need to worry about such things. The niece is okay but the family is upset, and the author is being blamed.\n\nNow, considering Colorado law. Even though marijuana is legal for adults, it's illegal to have it in a place where a minor could access it. Colorado's law requires that cannabis products be stored out of reach of children. So if the edibles were in a place a child could reach, the author might be violating the law. \n\nThe author's defense is that she didn't think about it because she's an adult, similar to not locking up wine. But the key difference is that the legal standard for cannabis is higher when children are involved. The law isn't just about intent but about the actual storage. So even if she didn't intend for the child to access it, the fact that the edibles were in an accessible place could make her legally and morally responsible.\n\nAlso, the family's reaction is understandable. They blame her because she had the edibles in a location that a child could easily reach. The parents and sister might feel that the author should have known better, given the presence of a child, even if it was a one-time situation. The author's argument that she didn't plan for this is valid, but responsibility isn't just about intent; it's about taking reasonable precautions.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is likely in the wrong because she didn't secure the edibles properly, which led to the child accessing them. Even if unintended, the failure to store them safely is a key factor here.\n"
