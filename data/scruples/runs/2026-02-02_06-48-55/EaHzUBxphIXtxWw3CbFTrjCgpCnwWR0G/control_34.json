I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for leaving edibles unlocked, leading their niece to get high. So, first, I need to analyze the situation step by step.\n\nThe author lives in Colorado where cannabis is legal. She's a 35-year-old woman who uses edibles for relaxation. Her sister asked her to babysit her 9-year-old niece because of an emergency. The niece was left with some books. The author mentions she hadn't considered the risk of the kid accessing the edibles because she thought of them like wine, not needing to be locked up. The niece ended up eating the sour gummies, got high, and the author panicked but she was fine.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author didn't lock up the edibles, which a child could reach. Even if she didn't think about it, having a child in the house\u2014especially one not used to being there\u2014means there's a responsibility to secure any substances that could be harmful. Edibles are not like wine; they're more dangerous, especially for kids. Even though the niece is okay, the situation could have been worse. The author's family is upset, and she's being blamed for not securing them.\n\nIn terms of legal context, Colorado has specific laws about cannabis and children. I think there's a law that requires cannabis products to be stored securely out of reach of children. If the author didn't follow that law, then legally she might be at fault. Even if she didn't intend harm, the responsibility to prevent foreseeable harm is there. The fact that the niece was in her care, even temporarily, adds to the responsibility.\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning that she doesn't need to lock up edibles because she's an adult might not hold up. When there's a child present, the standard of care increases. Not securing the edibles could be seen as negligence. The fact that the niece had access and consumed them shows a lack of precaution.\n\nThe author's reaction after the fact\u2014calling poison control, staying with the niece, apologizing\u2014shows concern, but the initial oversight is the main issue. The parents and sister's anger is justified because the situation could have had serious consequences. The author's family's concerns about her reliability with kids make sense given this incident.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author likely is in the wrong because she didn't take necessary precautions to secure the edibles when a child was present. Even with good intentions, the responsibility to protect the child from harm is paramount. The answer should be A.\n"
