I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after their niece got high from edibles that weren't locked up. The author lives in Colorado, where marijuana is legal. They had edibles on their dresser, and a 9-year-old ate some. The author didn't think to lock them up, thinking they wouldn't be a problem. Now, the family is upset, and the author is being blamed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal context. Colorado allows marijuana, but there are regulations about keeping it out of reach of children. The author might be violating those laws by not securing the edibles, especially since they knew a child would be in the house. Even though the author didn't expect it, the law might require childproofing.\n\nNext, the responsibility aspect. The author was caring for the niece, so there's a duty of care. The niece is young, and edibles can be appealing to kids. The author's argument is that they didn't think about it, similar to how people might not lock up wine. But drugs, even legal ones, can have more severe effects on children. The author's lack of foresight might be seen as negligence, regardless of intent.\n\nAlso, the family's reaction\u2014uninviting the author\u2014is a social consequence beyond legal. Even if the author didn't mean to harm, the act of not securing the edibles led to a preventable situation. The parents are justified in being upset because the author's oversight caused their child to get high, which could have been dangerous.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't intend harm, and the niece was okay. But responsibility isn't just about intent; it's about foreseeable risks. The author should have known that a child in the house could access the edibles and used the wrong judgment. So, the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
