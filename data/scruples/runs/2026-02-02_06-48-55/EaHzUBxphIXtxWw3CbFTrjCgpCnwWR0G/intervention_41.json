I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the 35-year-old woman) is in the wrong for not locking up her edibles, which led her niece to get high. The scenario is in Colorado, where cannabis is legal. The woman uses edibles for relaxation, didn't lock them up, and when her sister needed a sitter, the niece accessed them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Colorado has laws regarding cannabis, especially concerning minors. I remember that in Colorado, it's illegal to possess cannabis if you're under 21. The edibles are THC-infused, so even if legal for adults, they're not for children. The woman had them in an accessible place, which could be a problem under the state's laws. Colorado law requires that cannabis products be stored in a child-proof container or out of reach of children. If the woman didn't do that, she might be violating the law. So legally, she could be in the wrong.\n\nThen there's the moral or ethical aspect. The woman didn't lock up the edibles, assuming they were safe because she's an adult. But she had a 9-year-old in her home. Even if she didn't think about it beforehand, once she knew the kid was there, she should have taken precautions. The fact that she didn't lock them up shows negligence. Parents and guardians are responsible for ensuring their environment is safe, especially with minors present. The woman's oversight led to the niece consuming the edibles, which could have serious consequences. Even though the kid ended up okay, the risk was high.\n\nThe woman's defenses include not having had previous issues and not planning to harm the niece. However, the responsibility of safety isn't mitigated by lack of intent. Accidents can happen, but the key is whether she took reasonable precautions. Since she didn't lock the edibles up, which is a basic safety measure, especially knowing the kid was there, her negligence is the root of the problem.\n\nAlso, the reaction from family\u2014uninvited, blame, etc.\u2014shows that her actions were seen as reckless. Even if she didn't mean to, the outcome was preventable. The fact that she had to be warned by her sister that the kid might be bored suggests that the environment wasn't child-friendly, yet she didn't take steps to secure her edibles.\n\nIn terms of Colorado law, there's also the possibility of legal consequences. If the niece was harmed, the woman could be liable. Even if the kid recovered, she might face charges related to child endangerment or improper storage of cannabis. That adds another layer of wrongdoing.\n\nSo putting it all together, legally and ethically, the woman is in the wrong. She didn't take necessary precautions to secure her edibles, leading to a preventable accident. The answer should be A.\n"
