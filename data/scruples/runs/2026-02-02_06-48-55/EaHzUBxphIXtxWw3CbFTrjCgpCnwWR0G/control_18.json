I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that she had edibles (specifically sour gummies) on her dresser that her 9-year-old niece ate. The author didn't lock them up, thinking it wasn't necessary because she's an adult and didn't expect a kid to get into them. The niece got high, and the author is now being blamed by family members.\n\nFirst, I should consider the legal aspect. Colorado has laws about cannabis products, especially regarding keeping them away from children. The author might have violated a law by not storing the edibles safely around a minor. Even if it wasn't intentional, the law might require child-proofing, similar to how medications or alcohol are handled. \n\nNext, the context of supervision. The niece was at the author's house, and the author mentioned the house isn't very kid-friendly. The author took a shower and then noticed the niece was unresponsive. The fact that the niece found the edibles suggests that the storage wasn't secure. The author admitted she didn't think about it, but maybe that's a problem. Parents and guardians are typically expected to take precautions when children are present, especially with substances that can be mistaken for candy.\n\nThen there's the reaction of the family. They blame her, uninvited her from places with the kid, and her parents are harsh. The author argues she didn't intentionally do it. But the key here is negligence. Even without malice, if she didn't secure the edibles as she should have, that's negligence. \n\nComparing to alcohol: the author says she doesn't lock up wine, but edibles are different because they can be mistaken for candy. Also, a 9-year-old might not understand the difference. So the analogy to wine isn't perfect. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong because she didn't lock up the edibles. In many places, there are specific rules about storing cannabis products safely, and not doing so could be a violation. So legally and in terms of responsibility, she might be at fault. \n\nBut the author didn't mean to harm the kid, and the kid is okay. The family's reaction is harsh, but that doesn't mean she's not at fault. The main point is whether she had an obligation to secure the edibles when a child was present. Since she didn't, and the child accessed them, she's probably in the wrong. So answer A.\n"
