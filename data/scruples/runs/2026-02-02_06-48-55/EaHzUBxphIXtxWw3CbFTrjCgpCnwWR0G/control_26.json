I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not locking up her edibles, leading her niece to get high.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author lives in Colorado where cannabis is legal. She has edibles (sour gummies) on her dresser, not locked up. Her 9-year-old niece was left with her while the sister dealt with an emergency. The niece found and ate the edibles, leading to her getting high. The author didn't anticipate this, panicked, and is now facing backlash from family.\n\nKey points to consider: \n1. **Legal Context**: In Colorado, while cannabis is legal for adults, there are laws about keeping it out of reach of children. The author didn't lock up the edibles, which might be a legal oversight.\n2. **Child Safety**: Even if the author didn't intend for the child to access them, the responsibility of ensuring a safe environment when hosting a child is on the caregiver. Leaving edibles within a child's reach, even if it's not typical for adults, is a safety risk.\n3. **Intent vs. Negligence**: The author didn't do it on purpose, but negligence can still be a factor. The argument here is whether the author should have known the risk and taken precautions, regardless of prior habits.\n4. **Family Reactions**: The family's anger is understandable given the situation, but does that mean the author is an asshole? The term \"asshole\" here is subjective, but the question is about being in the wrong, not just being judged harshly.\n\nLegally, Colorado requires cannabis products to be stored securely to prevent access by children. The author didn't do that, so there's a legal and safety violation. Ethically, even if the author didn't foresee the issue, as a caregiver, she should have considered the child's access to potentially harmful substances. The parents' concerns are valid because childproofing the home is a standard expectation when caring for children.\n\nThe author did take responsibility, called poison control, and took care of the niece. However, the core issue is the failure to secure the edibles. The judgment here hinges on whether the author's actions (or inaction) constituted negligence. Since she was aware the child would be present, even if briefly, she should have secured the edibles. The fact that she didn't, despite knowing the child might be bored and looking for things to do, shows a lack of due care.\n\nSo, even though the author didn't intend harm, her negligence in securing the edibles led to the incident. Therefore, she is in the wrong.\n"
