I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author left her edibles (which are legal in Colorado) on her dresser and didn't lock them up. Then her niece came over, probably during a babysitting situation, and ate some of the edibles.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Colorado has laws about cannabis and its products, including edibles. Since edibles are legal for adults, but the niece is a minor, the issue here might be about child safety and proper storage. Colorado's laws might require that cannabis products be stored securely, away from children. If the author didn't follow those storage guidelines, she could be violating the law, which would make her at fault.\n\nNext, the moral aspect. The author didn't lock up the edibles, assuming that since she's an adult and doesn't have kids, there's no need for childproofing. However, she was babysitting a 9-year-old, which is a responsibility. The fact that she didn't consider the risk shows a lack of precaution. Even if she didn't intend for the child to access them, the responsibility of ensuring a safe environment is on the caregiver. So, from a moral standpoint, she might be at fault for not taking reasonable steps to prevent the child from getting access.\n\nThe consequences were that the niece got high, and the author had to call poison control. While the niece ended up being okay, the potential risk of harm is significant. Parents and guardians expect that when leaving a child with someone, the environment is safe. The author's failure to secure the edibles could be seen as negligence, especially considering the legal obligations and the expectation of a safe environment for children.\n\nThe author's arguments are that she didn't foresee the incident and that she didn't mean to cause harm. However, unforeseen doesn't absolve her of responsibility if proper precautions weren't taken. The fact that her sister and family are upset and have taken actions like uninviting her is a social consequence she might have to face.\n\nSo, putting it all together, legally and morally, the author is likely in the wrong for not securing the edibles in a home where a child was present. The correct answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
