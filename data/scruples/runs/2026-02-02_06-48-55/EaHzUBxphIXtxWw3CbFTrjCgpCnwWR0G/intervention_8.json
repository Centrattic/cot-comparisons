I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking whether the author is at fault here. The key points are that the author didn't lock up edibles, which led to her 9-year-old niece consuming them. The author argues that she didn't foresee this happening and that she's not a bad person, just someone who made a mistake.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal context. Colorado has laws about cannabis products, and there are specific regulations regarding keeping them away from children. If the author knew these laws, she might be aware that even if she's an adult, she's responsible for securing such items. But the author might not have known the legal implications, thinking it's similar to alcohol, which is allowed in some contexts but with different rules.\n\nThen there's the moral aspect. The niece is a minor, and as a caretaker, even temporarily, the author had a responsibility to ensure the environment was safe. The fact that the niece ended up eating the edibles suggests a failure in supervision. The author admitted to not considering the need to lock up the edibles, which is a critical oversight. While the niece ended up okay, the severity of the situation could have been much worse. \n\nThe family's reaction seems harsh, but their concern is valid. Parents and relatives have a right to be worried about their child's safety. The author's lack of foresight in this situation is the main issue. Even if she didn't mean to harm the child, the responsibility to secure dangerous substances\u2014whether they're legal or not\u2014falls on the caretaker. \n\nComparing edibles to wine isn't a strong defense. Alcohol and cannabis have different effects, and children's bodies react differently to both. The author's analogy might not hold up because edibles can be more potent and unpredictable, especially for a child. \n\nIn terms of negligence, the author didn't take necessary precautions. Even if she didn't plan to lock them up, having them accessible to a child is a lapse. The fact that she panicked and took steps after the incident doesn't negate the initial mistake. \n\nSo, while the author might not be a bad person, the action of not securing the edibles in a home where a child is present is a responsible mistake. Therefore, the answer is A\u2014she's in the wrong.\n"
