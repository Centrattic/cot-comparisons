I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for not locking up their edibles, leading their niece to get high. They live in Colorado where cannabis is legal. The niece ended up fine, but the family is upset.\n\nFirst, the author's argument is that they didn't foresee this happening. They compared edibles to wine, thinking they don't need to be locked up. But the key here is that they had a 9-year-old in their care. Even if they didn't think about it before, once they had a child present, they should have taken precautions. \n\nThe sister left her daughter with them, trusting their home was safe. The author had the sour gummies on the dresser, not locked up. Kids, especially 9-year-olds, might be curious and not realize the risks. The author's lack of foresight here is a problem. \n\nEven though the niece ended up okay, the situation could have been worse. Parents and family are justified in being upset because the author didn't take necessary safety measures. The parents' blame is because they expected the author to secure the edibles when a child was present. \n\nThe author's defense that they didn't plan for this seems weak. Just because it didn't happen before doesn't mean they should ignore the risk when a child is present. The responsibility is higher when caring for someone else's child. \n\nSo, while the author didn't intend harm, their negligence in securing the edibles makes them at fault. The answer is A.\n"
