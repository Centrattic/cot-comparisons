I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not locking up her edibles, which her niece consumed, leading to the kid getting high. The question is whether the author is responsible here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal context. Colorado has strict laws about cannabis products, including child-resistant packaging and storage requirements. The author is an adult who knows about these laws, so she should be aware that cannabis products, even in edible form, need to be stored safely. Leaving them accessible to a child, even unintentionally, might be a violation of those laws.\n\nNext, the situation: The author had a 9-year-old overnight, and the niece accessed the edibles when she was in the shower. The author mentioned that she didn't lock them up because she didn't think about it, comparing it to not locking up wine. But alcohol and cannabis are different in terms of legal handling and potential dangers, especially for children. Wine is not a controlled substance in the same way, and edibles, especially in forms like gummies, can be mistaken for regular candy by kids.\n\nThe author's responsibility here is key. Even if it was an oversight, the fact remains that she had cannabis products in a place where a child could access them. Parents and caregivers have a duty to ensure that any substances that could harm a child are secured. The author's argument that she didn't plan for this and it wasn't intentional doesn't absolve her responsibility. The legal and moral obligation to prevent harm to a child is high, especially when it comes to substances that can cause harm.\n\nAlso, the reaction from family members is understandable. The niece was under the care of the author, and the fact that she ingested cannabis due to the author's negligence would understandably cause anger and concern. The author's own admission that she didn't consider the risk shows a lapse in judgment, even if unintentional.\n\nIn legal terms, Colorado requires that cannabis products be stored out of reach of children. Failure to do so can result in legal consequences. So, from both a legal and ethical standpoint, the author is in the wrong because she didn't take necessary precautions. The harm was preventable, and her oversight led to a situation that endangered the child's well-being.\n"
