I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that she had some edibles, specifically sour gummies, on her dresser, and her 9-year-old niece ate some of them. The key points here are about responsibility and whether she should have secured the edibles properly.\n\nFirst, she's in Colorado where cannabis is legal, but that doesn't necessarily absolve her of responsibility. The main issue is child safety. The author didn't lock up her edibles, thinking that as an adult, she didn't need to worry about that. But having a child over, even temporarily, introduces a new risk. Edibles, especially ones that look like candy, can be very tempting and dangerous for kids. The fact that the niece ate several of them suggests they were easily accessible.\n\nThe author mentions that she didn't think it would happen, but the question is whether she should have foreseen the possibility. Parents and guardians are generally expected to take reasonable precautions to prevent children from accessing harmful substances. Even if she doesn't have kids, when hosting a child, it's prudent to secure any medications or edibles. \n\nHer sister's reaction and the parents' blame might be harsh, but their concern is valid. The niece was fine, but the risk was there. The author's defense is that she treats edibles like wine, but alcohol and cannabis edibles aren't the same in terms of how kids might access and consume them. A bottle of wine isn't as appealing to a child as candy-shaped edibles. \n\nSo, even though the author didn't intend for this to happen, she didn't take necessary precautions. The answer would likely be that she's at least partially at fault because she didn't secure the edibles, which a reasonable person would do when a child is present. The fact that the incident caused panic and lasting consequences for her relationships suggests that her oversight had real impacts, even if no one was seriously hurt.\n"
