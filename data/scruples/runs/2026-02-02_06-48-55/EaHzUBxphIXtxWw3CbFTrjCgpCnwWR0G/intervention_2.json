I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after their niece accidentally consumed edibles that weren't locked up. The situation is in Colorado where cannabis is legal.\n\nFirst, the author had edibles on their dresser, which they didn't lock up. They had a 9-year-old over, and the child accessed them. The key here is whether the author's actions were negligent or not. The author mentions that they didn't lock up the edibles because they're a 35-year-old woman who didn't think about it, similar to how they wouldn't lock up wine. But kids aren't typically expected to be in an adult's home where cannabis is present, even if it's legal.\n\nColorado has laws about keeping cannabis out of reach of children, similar to alcohol laws. So even if someone is a responsible adult, they should take precautions when children are around. The author was aware the child was coming over, even if briefly, and should have considered childproofing their space. The fact that the niece was left alone for a while (when the author took a shower) and had access to the dresser where the edibles were is a red flag.\n\nThe author's argument is that they didn't foresee it, but foreseeability is a key part of negligence. If an adult knows a child is in their home, they should anticipate that the child might find and consume something like edibles. The parents and sister are upset because their child was exposed to something dangerous. Even though the niece ended up fine, the risk was there, and the author's failure to secure the edibles could have led to a worse outcome.\n\nThe author's reaction of being blamed by family and uninvited from events is harsh, but their responsibility in the situation is valid. The legal and moral obligation to protect a child in their care, especially when they're in an environment with accessible cannabis products, requires more caution. The author's lack of foresight and failure to secure the edibles makes them at least partially responsible, even if it was a mistake rather than intentional harm.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer is A. The author is in the wrong for not securing the edibles when they knew a child was in their home.\n"
