I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that she had edibles (sour gummies) on her dresser, didn't lock them up, and her 9-year-old niece ate some, getting high. The question is whether she's at fault.\n\nFirst, Colorado has strict laws about keeping cannabis products secure, especially around minors. Even though she didn't lock them up before, the fact that she had a child in her home changes things. The key point is whether she should have known the risk. She mentioned she's a 35-year-old woman who doesn't lock up edibles because she sees herself as responsible. But when a 9-year-old is in her home, even temporarily, the responsibility increases. \n\nThe sister dropped off the niece quickly, and the author warned her the kid might be bored. But maybe that warning wasn't enough. If she knew or should have known that a child could access those edibles, then she's in the wrong. Colorado law requires cannabis products to be stored safely to prevent access by minors. So from a legal standpoint, she might be violating the law by not securing them. \n\nAlso, common sense says that when someone else's child is in your home, you should take precautions. Even if she's not a parent, the fact that the niece could access the edibles without supervision suggests negligence. She was taking a shower when the incident happened, which gives the niece an opportunity to get into them. \n\nHer family is blaming her, and she's been uninvited because people think she's a risk. The parents might be overreacting, but their reaction is based on the fact that she didn't secure the edibles. So morally and legally, she's probably in the wrong because she should have taken precautions when she knew a child was present. Even if she didn't intend for it to happen, the responsibility is on her to ensure the child's safety.\n"
