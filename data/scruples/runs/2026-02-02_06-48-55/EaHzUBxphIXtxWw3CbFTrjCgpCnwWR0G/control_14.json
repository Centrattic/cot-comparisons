I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that she had edibles in her room, didn't lock them up, and her 9-year-old niece ate some, got high, but is now fine. She's in Colorado where edibles are legal.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Even though it's legal, there are probably laws about having cannabis products in a way that's accessible to minors. The writer didn't lock them up, which might be a violation. Colorado's laws might require secure storage for edibles to prevent access by children. If that's the case, she could be at fault legally.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. She's a 35-year-old adult who didn't consider the risks of having edibles around a child. Even if she didn't expect it, the responsibility is on her to ensure that any substances that could harm a child are out of reach. The fact that she compared them to wine is a problem because alcohol and cannabis have different legal considerations, especially with kids. Wine isn't typically left out for kids either.\n\nHer parents and sister are upset because she didn't secure the edibles. The sister was in an emergency situation and had to leave the kid with her. The writer should have known better, even if she didn't think about it at the time. The consequences could have been worse, and the fact that she's facing backlash from family makes it clear they feel she's responsible.\n\nSo, even though the kid is okay, the writer didn't take necessary precautions. The answer is probably A (she's in the wrong) because she didn't secure the edibles, which is a responsible action required when minors are present. The legal and ethical responsibilities here point towards her being at fault.\n"
