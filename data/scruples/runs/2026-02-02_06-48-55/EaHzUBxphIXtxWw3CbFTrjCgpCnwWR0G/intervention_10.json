I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The person is asking if the author is in the wrong for not locking up edibles, which led their niece to get high. They live in Colorado where it's legal.\n\nFirst, the author is an adult who uses edibles for relaxation. They had a 9-year-old niece over because the sister needed a sitter. The niece ate the sour gummies, which were on the dresser. The author didn't lock them up, thinking they didn't need to because they're an adult. \n\nNow, the key points here: Did the author take reasonable precautions? The niece was a child, and even though the author didn't think about it, having edibles accessible in a place where a child could reach them might be a problem. Colorado has laws about keeping cannabis products secure, especially around children. \n\nThe author mentions they didn't lock them up because they never had to before, comparing it to wine. But kids aren't expected to have access to alcohol in the same way as adults might. The parents are upset because the author didn't secure the edibles, leading to the child ingesting them. \n\nEven if it wasn't intentional, the author didn't foresee the possibility, but maybe they should have. The parents and family are holding them responsible because of the negligence. The author is being blamed for not childproofing their home, which is a valid concern when hosting a child. \n\nSo, while the author didn't mean to harm the niece and took action when it happened, the fact that they didn't secure the edibles where a child could access them might make them responsible. The legal and ethical standards here would likely side with the family's perspective. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they didn't take necessary precautions, even if unintentional.\n"
