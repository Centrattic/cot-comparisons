I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not locking up edibles, leading her niece to get high. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author is in Colorado where marijuana is legal. She was looking after her 9-year-old niece when the sister needed a sitter. The niece ate some edibles that were left out on the dresser. The author didn't lock them up, thinking she didn't need to because she's an adult. The niece got high, but is okay now. The family is upset, and the author is being blamed.\n\nSo, the key points here. Colorado law requires securing cannabis products from children. Even though the author didn't plan for the child to be there, once a child is in her care, she's responsible. The fact that she didn't childproof her home, knowing that the niece is a child, might be a problem. \n\nAlso, the author's reasoning that she doesn't need to lock up edibles because she's an adult is flawed. The presence of a child, even temporarily, creates a responsibility to secure substances that can be harmful. The legal obligation in Colorado is to keep cannabis out of reach of children, so not doing so could be against the law. \n\nEven though the niece is okay, the fact that the edibles were accessible and the author didn't take precautions shows negligence. The family's reaction is understandable because it's a serious situation. The author didn't consider the risks, which is where her mistake lies. \n\nSo, considering the legal requirements and the responsibility of caring for a child, the author is in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
