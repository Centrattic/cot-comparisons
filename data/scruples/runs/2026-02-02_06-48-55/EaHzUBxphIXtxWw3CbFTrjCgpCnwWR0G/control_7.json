I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not locking up her edibles, leading her niece to get high. Let's break down the details.\n\nFirst, the author lives in Colorado where recreational marijuana is legal. She uses edibles for relaxation. Her sister needed a sitter for her 9-year-old niece, so she offered to help. She warned her sister that there might be nothing to keep the kid entertained, but the niece came over with some books. The author didn't lock up her edibles, assuming she's an adult and doesn't need to worry about that. She took a shower, and when she came back, the niece had eaten the sour gummies, got high, and was acting strange.\n\nNow, the author argues that she didn't foresee this happening and that she's not an asshole because it was an accident. She feels blamed by her family for not taking precautions. But the other side is that she should have known a child might be in the house and should have secured the edibles.\n\nSo, legal standpoint: In Colorado, adults can possess marijuana, but if someone allows a minor to access it, that's a problem. Even if the author didn't know the niece would be there, once a child is in her care, she's responsible for their safety. She didn't take steps to secure the edibles, which a child could easily access. \n\nMoral standpoint: Even if it wasn't intentional, the responsibility of keeping substances that can harm children out of reach is on the adult. The author might not have thought of it, but as a parent or caregiver, the expectation is to childproof the environment when a child is present. The fact that her sister brought the child over unexpectedly might complicate things, but the author should have considered that possibility and taken precautions.\n\nThe arguments against the author include negligence. She had a child in her care, and she didn't secure the edibles. Even if she didn't think about it, the responsibility is on her. The fact that her niece ended up high could have been a more serious situation, and she was lucky it was mild. \n\nOn the other side, she didn't intentionally harm the child, and maybe she didn't have a history of having children over. However, the key point is that when a child is in your home, you should take all necessary precautions to prevent access to harmful substances. The author didn't do that, which led to the incident.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because she had a duty of care to ensure the environment was safe for the child, and not securing the edibles was negligent. Even if it was accidental, the responsibility lies with her to prevent such access.\n"
