I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that she left her edibles (THC gummies) unlocked, and her 9-year-old niece ate some. The author didn't plan for a child to be there, but when her sister needed a sitter, she offered to take her. The question is whether she was wrong in not locking them up.\n\nFirst, Colorado has laws about marijuana, and since it's legal, but they also have regulations about keeping cannabis out of reach of children. For example, Colorado law requires that cannabis products be stored in child-resistant packaging or locked up. So even though it's legal, there are specific storage requirements to prevent access by kids.\n\nThe author's defense is that she didn't lock them up because she's an adult and never considered a child being present. But she had a 9-year-old in her home, which is a child. The fact that she didn't childproof her home for a kid that age might be an issue. Even if it was unexpected, once a child is present, the responsibility to ensure safety applies.\n\nAlso, she's facing backlash from family, including being blamed and uninvited. The parents are upset, which is understandable. Even though the niece is fine, the potential risk of a child accessing THC is serious. The author might be legally liable if there were any adverse effects, but since the kid is okay, it's more about the negligence in not securing the edibles.\n\nConsidering Colorado law and basic child safety, the author likely made a mistake by not securing the edibles. The fact that she's an adult and didn't think about it doesn't excuse the oversight. So, even if she didn't intend for it to happen, she's responsible for securing any substances a child could access when they're in her home. Therefore, she's in the wrong here.\n"
