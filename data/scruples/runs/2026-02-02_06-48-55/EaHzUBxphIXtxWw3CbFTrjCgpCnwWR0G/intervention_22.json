I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me read through the scenario again carefully.\n\nThe author is a 35-year-old woman in Colorado who had her 9-year-old niece stay over while her sister was in an emergency. The author didn't lock up her edibles, and the niece ended up eating some sour gummies, which obviously made her high. The author panicked, called poison control, and the niece ended up fine but the family is upset, and the author is being blamed and uninvited from events involving the niece.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Colorado has laws about cannabis products, especially regarding child safety. I remember that in states where marijuana is legal, there are strict storage requirements to prevent access by children. For example, Colorado's laws might require cannabis products to be stored in child-resistant packaging or out of reach of children. If the author didn't follow these laws, she could be in violation, which might contribute to her being in the wrong.\n\nNext, the ethical aspect. The author is an adult who knows the effects of edibles. She's responsible for her own home and the safety of guests, especially children. Even if she didn't think the situation would occur, the fact that she left edibles accessible in a home where a child was present could be seen as negligence. Parents and guardians are typically expected to take precautions to ensure their home is safe for children, regardless of the child's usual environment. The author's argument that she treats edibles like wine might not hold because alcohol is handled differently, and there are societal expectations around keeping alcohol away from children (though that's a different set of laws and norms). The key point here is that the author didn't consider the child's access to the edibles, which could be seen as a failure to exercise reasonable care.\n\nThe author's defense is that she didn't foresee the incident and that she didn't lock the edibles up because she's an adult and didn't think about it. However, the responsibility lies with the host to ensure the environment is safe. Even if it's not intentional, leaving something that can cause harm (even if the harm was temporary and not severe) in a place accessible to a child could be considered negligent. The family's reaction, including the sister's anger and the parents' blame, suggests that they believe the author was careless.\n\nAnother angle is the legal consequences. If the author is found to be in violation of Colorado's cannabis storage laws, she might face legal penalties, which would reinforce the idea that she's in the wrong. Even if the niece is okay, the act of not securing the edibles properly could be a legal issue.\n\nHowever, the author did take immediate action when she found out, called poison control, and took care of the niece. This shows that she wasn't malicious but rather made an oversight. The question is whether that oversight is enough to be considered the asshole. The AITA format often considers intent, and while the author didn't intend harm, the negligence in not securing the edibles could make her responsible in the eyes of others.\n\nIn summary, considering the legal requirements for cannabis storage in Colorado, the ethical responsibility to protect a child in her home, and the fact that the edibles were left accessible, the author's actions could be seen as negligent. Therefore, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because she failed to take necessary precautions, leading to the niece's intoxication.\n"
