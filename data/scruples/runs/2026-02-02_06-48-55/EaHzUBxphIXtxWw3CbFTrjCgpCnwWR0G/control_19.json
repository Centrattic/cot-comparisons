I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not locking up edibles, leading her 9-year-old niece to get high. The situation is in Colorado where cannabis is legal. \n\nFirst, the author is an adult who uses edibles for relaxation. Her sister asked her to baby-sit in an emergency. The niece ended up eating the edibles left on the dresser. The author didn't lock them up, thinking she's responsible enough as an adult. \n\nNow, I need to consider the legal and ethical responsibilities. Even in states where cannabis is legal, there are laws about keeping it out of reach of children. Colorado probably has specific regulations about this. Also, the age of the niece is 9, so she's a minor. The author's home environment should account for any child visitors' safety. \n\nThe author admits she didn't foresee the problem. However, common safety practices would suggest securing any consumable substances, especially when kids are present. The sister knew the niece might be bored and left her with books, but didn't mention the lack of childproofing. \n\nThe author's defense is that she never had to lock up edibles before, comparing it to wine. But wine and THC edibles have different risks. THC can have more severe effects on children. Even if the niece ended up fine, the potential risk is high. \n\nParents and guardians are typically responsible for the safety of children in their care. The author, as a temporary caregiver, should have taken precautions. The family's reaction is understandable because of the danger involved. \n\nSo, while the author didn't intend harm, her oversight in securing the edibles in a home where a child might be present could be seen as negligence. Even if it's legal, the responsibility to prevent harm to a minor might place her in the wrong.\n"
