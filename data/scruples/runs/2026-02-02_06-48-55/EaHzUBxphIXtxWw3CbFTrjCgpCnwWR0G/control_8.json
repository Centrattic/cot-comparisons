I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not locking up edibles, which their 9-year-old niece consumed, leading her to get high. The author is in Colorado where cannabis is legal. They didn't think to lock up the edibles because they're an adult who uses them for relaxation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In Colorado, even though cannabis is legal for adults, there are laws about keeping it secure from children. I think there's a law that requires cannabis products to be stored in child-resistant containers or in a locked location where children can't access them. If that's the case, the author might be violating that law by leaving edibles on a dresser where a child could reach them. So legally, they might be at fault.\n\nThen there's the responsibility aspect. The author was babysitting their niece, even if it was on a short notice. They knew she was a child and should have anticipated that she might come into contact with things the author uses. The author compared edibles to wine, but a 9-year-old isn't going to drink wine, so the comparison isn't fair. Edibles, especially in forms like sour gummies, can be mistaken for regular candy, so the risk is higher. The author didn't take precautions, which shows negligence. Even if they didn't foresee it happening, they should have known the potential danger and taken steps to prevent it.\n\nThe family's reaction is also a point. The sister, parents, and others are upset because they feel the author didn't take necessary precautions. The author's defense that they never had to lock up edibles before doesn't hold up when a child is present. The situation is different when there's a minor in the house. The author's responsibility increases when caring for a child, so not securing the edibles was a mistake.\n\nAlso, the fact that the niece ended up fine might mitigate some of the blame, but it doesn't erase the responsibility. The author's actions (or inactions) led to an avoidable situation. Even if it was an accident, the lack of foresight is a problem. The parents are right to be concerned about future safety, which is why the author is being excluded from events with the niece.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is likely in the wrong because they didn't secure the edibles properly, which is a legal requirement and a responsible action when a child is present. Their argument about comparing it to wine is invalid in this context. The negligence, even if unintentional, led to a dangerous situation, making them responsible.\n"
