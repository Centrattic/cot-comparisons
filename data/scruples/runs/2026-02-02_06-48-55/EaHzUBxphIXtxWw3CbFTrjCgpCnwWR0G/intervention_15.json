I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about a 35-year-old woman in Colorado who left her edibles (THC-infused sour gummies) on her dresser without securing them. She had her 9-year-old niece over to babysit while her sister dealt with an emergency. The niece ate several of the edibles, leading to the question of whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, legal context is important. Colorado has legalized recreational marijuana, but there are still laws around keeping it secure from minors. Possession without securing it properly could lead to legal issues. The author's defense is that she doesn't lock up edibles because she's an adult and doesn't think about it, comparing it to not locking up wine. However, a 9-year-old child is a minor, and the responsibility of the caregiver includes ensuring the environment is safe for the child. Even if the author didn't intend for the child to access the edibles, the fact that she left them in a place accessible to a child is a key point. \n\nThe author's oversight in childproofing her home when she knew the child was present is a significant factor. Parents and caregivers are generally expected to take reasonable steps to protect children from harm, including securing substances that could be harmful. The author's argument that she didn't foresee the incident is weak because the potential risk is obvious. The consequences, while the niece ended up fine, could have been much worse. \n\nAlso, the reactions from family members are understandable given the potential danger. The author's failure to secure the edibles shows negligence, even if unintentional. The comparison to a bottle of wine is flawed because alcohol and edibles are different in terms of accessibility and the way they affect a child. Wine is typically in a place adults drink, while edibles might be mistaken for regular candy. \n\nIn conclusion, the author is responsible for the child's safety during her care. Leaving edibles within reach is a preventable risk. The answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because she didn't take necessary precautions to secure the edibles, putting the child at risk.\n"
