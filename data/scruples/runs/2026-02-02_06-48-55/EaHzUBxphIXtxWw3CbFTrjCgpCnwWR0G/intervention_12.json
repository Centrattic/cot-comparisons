I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me break this down. The person is asking if the author is in the wrong for not locking up their edibles, leading to their niece getting high. The situation is in Colorado where cannabis is legal. The author is an adult who uses edibles for relaxation and had a 9-year-old niece over for a few hours. The niece ate the sour gummies, which were on the dresser and not secured. The author didn't foresee this, panicked, and now is facing criticism and uninvitations.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal context. Even though cannabis is legal in Colorado, having it accessible to a minor can be an issue. There are child safety laws for cannabis products, similar to other medications or substances. The author didn't lock them up, which might be a violation of those laws. \n\nNext, the responsibility of the host. When someone brings a child into their home, especially when the host isn't used to having kids around, there's an expectation to childproof the environment. Wine might be okay, but cannabis edibles, which look like candy, are a different story. The author should have realized that a child might mistake them for regular candy and not just leave them in an accessible place.\n\nThe reaction of the family and the author's own admission that they didn't consider the risk shows a lack of awareness. Even if it was a mistake, the fact that it happened means there was a failure in responsibility. The author's defense that they didn't plan to have the child there isn't sufficient because they knew the child was coming and should have taken precautions.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author didn't secure the edibles, leading to the niece ingesting them. Even if unintentional, the responsibility lies with the host to ensure the environment is safe. Legal and safety standards require cannabis to be stored securely, and the author failed to do that. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
