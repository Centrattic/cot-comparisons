Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for yelling at some kids' mom because they didn't include their disabled daughter in the play.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The parent saw their daughter, who has cerebral palsy, sitting on the veranda watching two kids playing ball. They went to confront the mother of the kids, yelling questions about being embarrassed and saying the daughter isn't poisonous. The other mom didn't respond and went back to the caravan. Later, the kids did include the daughter. The partner thinks the parent overreacted.\n\nSo, the key points here: the parent was advocating for their daughter's inclusion, which is valid, but they did it by yelling and making accusatory remarks. The other mom was taken aback, and the kids eventually included the daughter. The parent's intention was to ensure their child wasn't excluded, but the method was confrontational.\n\nNow, whether the parent is in the wrong. On one hand, advocating for inclusion is important, especially for a child with disabilities who might face social challenges. The parent was trying to address what they perceived as exclusion. On the other hand, confronting the mother in a public, yelling manner might have been inappropriate. It's possible that the mother didn't realize the daughter wanted to join or didn't know how to include her. Yelling could have made the situation more hostile, leading the mother to withdraw rather than address the issue calmly.\n\nThe daughter did eventually join the kids, so maybe the parent's actions led to a positive outcome, but that's not necessarily a justification for the method used. The question is about whether the parent was in the wrong. In social interactions, directness is important, but the approach matters. Yelling and accusatory language can escalate tensions and may not be the most effective way to resolve the situation. A more constructive approach might have been to speak to the mother calmly, explain the situation, and suggest inclusion.\n\nHowever, considering the parent's intent was to protect their child's social inclusion, which is a valid concern, some might empathize with their frustration. Still, the manner in which it was handled could be seen as overreacting, especially since they yelled and made confrontational comments. The partner also thinks they overreacted, indicating that even within the relationship, there's a view that the response was too harsh.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at both intent and action. The intent here was good, but the action was aggressive. So the answer might lean towards the parent being in the wrong because of how they handled it, even if the concern was justified.\n"
