Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about whether the author is in the wrong for yelling at other kids for not including their disabled daughter.\n\nFirst, the context: The author's daughter is sitting outside watching other kids play. The author yells at the mother, implying she's embarrassed by her child. Then the author says something about the daughter having cerebral palsy. The mother leaves, and later the kids include the daughter.\n\nNow, the key points. The author's intention was to defend their daughter and encourage inclusion. But the method used was yelling at another person's mother. That could be seen as confrontational. Even if the goal is good, the way it's done matters. Yelling might escalate tension and not set a good example for the daughter about conflict resolution. \n\nHowever, the mother did respond by including the daughter later, showing that the author's actions might have had a positive effect. But does that justify yelling? Maybe not. The partner thinks the author overreacted, which is a common perspective in such cases. \n\nAlso, the author's daughter was included after the incident, so maybe the mother was just initially taken aback. Publicly confronting someone can be hurtful, even if the intent is good. The author might have handled it better by approaching the mother calmly instead of yelling. \n\nSo, while the intention was to protect their daughter, the method used could be considered inappropriate. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they chose a confrontational approach instead of a more respectful one.\n"
