Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about their disabled daughter not being included in a game of ball by other kids. The author yells at the mother, saying things like \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid?\" and \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous.\" Then the other mom storms off, but eventually the kids include the daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intent. The author's main goal was to defend their daughter and encourage inclusion, which is a good thing. But the method they used was yelling and confronting the other mother. Yelling can be seen as aggressive, even if the intention is good. It might have embarrassed the other mom, making her defensive. Maybe she didn't realize her kids weren't including the daughter, or maybe she's dealing with her own stress.\n\nAlso, the author's partner thinks they overreacted. That's a point to consider. It's possible that a calmer approach, like speaking to the mother privately, could have been more effective and less confrontational. However, the mother's reaction was to storm off, which might indicate guilt or shock. But that's not an excuse for yelling. The author's daughter's inclusion is important, but the way to handle it might matter as much as the intent. So, maybe the author's intent was right, but the method was wrong. So answer A (in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong)? It's a bit of a toss-up. Some might argue that standing up for their child is right, but the yelling could be seen as crossing a line. I think the answer is A because the approach was aggressive, even if the intent was good.\n"
