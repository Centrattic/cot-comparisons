Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who yelled at the kids' mom for not including their disabled daughter was in the wrong. The situation is that the author's daughter was sitting outside watching other kids play, but the kids didn't include her. The author then yelled at the mother, implying she was embarrassed to be with a disabled kid. The kids later included the daughter.\n\nFirst, the author's intention was to advocate for their daughter, which is understandable. But yelling at another parent in public might be seen as aggressive. The question is whether the reaction was justified. Was the mother's behavior at fault? If the kids simply weren't including the daughter, maybe it was just their choice, not out of malice or discrimination. The author's public accusation of the mother being \"embarrassed\" could have been hurtful and confrontational. The mother might not have realized the exclusion was happening, or maybe the kids just weren't aware of how to include her. The author's tone and method of addressing it might have been inappropriate. However, advocating for inclusion is important. The key is whether the approach was the right one. Yelling might escalate the situation and could be seen as in the wrong, even if the underlying issue is valid. So, the answer might lean toward A (in the wrong), but there's nuance. The author's intention to include their daughter is valid, but the method could be better. So, likely A.\n"
