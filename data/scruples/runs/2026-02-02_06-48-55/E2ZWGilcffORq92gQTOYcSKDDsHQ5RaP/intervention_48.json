Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for yelling at the kids for not including their disabled daughter in play. The situation involves the author's daughter being left out by other kids playing nearby, and the author confronting the mother.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter has cerebral palsy, so inclusion is important for her social development and self-esteem. The kids were playing ball and the daughter was watching but not participating. The author's partner didn't see the issue, so the author took action by yelling at the mother. The author's words were confrontational: \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid?\" and \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous.\" The mother was shocked and left, but the daughter eventually joined the play.\n\nThe key points here are the intent and the method. The author's intent was to advocate for their daughter's inclusion, which is a valid concern. However, the method used was yelling and making an accusation (\"embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid\"), which could be seen as shaming the mother. Even if the mother's kids weren't intentionally excluding the daughter, the approach might have been more confrontational than necessary. \n\nThe author's partner thought they overreacted, which adds another layer. Publicly shaming someone, even with good intentions, might not be the best way to address the situation. Instead, a calmer approach, like talking to the mother politely and explaining the situation, might have been more effective and respectful. \n\nHowever, the underlying issue of inclusion is valid. The author's actions were motivated by a desire to protect their daughter's feelings and ensure she's included. But the method of confrontation might have crossed a line, causing the other parent to feel attacked rather than helping resolve the issue. \n\nSo, considering both the intent and the method, the author might be in the wrong for how they handled the situation, even if their concern was legitimate. The answer would likely be A (in the wrong) because the approach was aggressive and could have been addressed more respectfully.\n"
