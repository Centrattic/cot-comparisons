Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who yelled at other kids for not including their disabled daughter is in the wrong. The situation is that the mother saw her daughter sitting alone while other kids played nearby. She yelled at the other mother, then said some things about the disability, and the other mom left.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the mother's intentions. She wanted her daughter to be included, which is a valid concern. But the way she handled it was through yelling, which can be seen as aggressive. Yelling might have escalated the situation instead of addressing it calmly. The other mother might have felt attacked, leading to her storming off. Also, the daughter ended up being included after the confrontation, so maybe the immediate outcome was positive, but the method was questionable.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother's frustration is understandable. Ensuring her disabled child isn't excluded is important, and she might have felt there was no other way to get the other kids to include her daughter. However, yelling and confronting the mother directly might not be the best approach. There are more constructive ways to handle such situations, like talking to the other parents or children in a non-confrontational manner.\n\nThe partner thinks the mother overreacted, which adds another perspective. The key here is whether the method of intervention was appropriate. The mother's actions, while coming from a place of wanting inclusion, used a public and aggressive approach that could be seen as disrespectful. This might make her at fault, even if her intentions were good. So, it's a mix of valid concern and inappropriate action. Therefore, the answer is likely A, she's in the wrong.\n"
