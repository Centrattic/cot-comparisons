Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who yelled at the kids' mom is in the wrong. The situation is about a disabled daughter being excluded from play. The parent yells at the other mom, asking if she's embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid and mentions cerebral palsy. The other mom storms off, and then later the kids do include the daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intent. The parent's intention was to advocate for their daughter, which is understandable. But the method was yelling, which might be seen as aggressive. Yelling can escalate situations and might not be the best approach, even if the concern is valid. The other mom's reaction suggests that the yelling was unexpected or hurtful. \n\nBut then, the daughter ended up being included by the kids, which is positive. However, the parent's partner thinks they overreacted. The key points here are the justification of the parent's action versus the method used. While advocating for inclusion is important, doing so in a loud and confrontational manner could be seen as inappropriate, especially if it's done in public and in front of the child. \n\nAlso, the parent's statement about cerebral palsy might come across as condescending or implying that the other mom was ignorant. The other mom's reaction (storming off) could indicate that the approach was not effective and perhaps hurtful. Even if the parent's intent was good, the method might have been flawed. \n\nIn terms of social norms, yelling in such situations is often discouraged because it can create tension and potentially lead to more exclusion. The parent might have been better served by approaching the other mom calmly to address the issue. So, while the parent's concern is valid, the method of addressing it could be considered in the wrong. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) for the approach, even if the intent was good.\n"
