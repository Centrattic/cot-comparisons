Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for yelling at kids and their mom for not including their disabled daughter in play. The situation is that the author's daughter was sitting outside watching other kids play, and the author decided to confront the mother by yelling, making a comment about being embarrassed and that the daughter isn't poisonous. The daughter later joined the kids, but the author is now questioning if they overreacted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter has cerebral palsy, which is a disability. The main issue here is the mother's reaction to her daughter being excluded. Yelling in public, especially at another parent, can be seen as aggressive. But the author's intent was to advocate for their child's inclusion. \n\nHowever, the method of confrontation might be questionable. Yelling from a distance and making accusatory statements like \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid?\" could be perceived as hostile. Even if the intention was good, the approach might have been inappropriate. \n\nThe mother's reaction\u2014storming off into the caravan\u2014suggests that the interaction was uncomfortable for her. Maybe the kids weren't intentionally excluding the daughter, or the mother felt her children needed to focus on their own game. The author didn't try to approach the mother calmly first, which could have been a better way to address the issue. \n\nThe daughter later joined the kids, so maybe the situation resolved itself. The partner's opinion that the author overreacted adds another layer. It's possible that the author's emotions were heightened due to concern for their child, leading to an impulsive reaction. \n\nIn terms of ethics, advocating for one's child is understandable, but the method of doing so matters. Public shaming or yelling might not be the most effective or respectful approach. It's important to consider the other parent's perspective and the children's safety and comfort. \n\nSo, while the author's intent was to protect their child, the manner in which they did so might be seen as inconsiderate or overly aggressive. The answer could be A (the author is in the wrong) because the response was confrontational and perhaps not the best approach, even if the concern was valid.\n"
