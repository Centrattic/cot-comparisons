Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who yelled at the kids' mom for not including their disabled daughter is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author's daughter has cerebral palsy and was sitting outside watching other kids play. The kids were with their mom. The author yells at the mom accusing her of being embarrassed to be seen with a disabled child and mentions that it's just cerebral palsy and she's not poisonous. The mom storms off, but later the kids include the daughter.\n\nNow, considering the context. The parent is advocating for their child's inclusion, which is a valid concern. However, the method used was yelling at the other mother, which might be seen as aggressive. Even if the intention was good, yelling can come across as hostile, potentially escalating the situation. \n\nThe other mom might have had reasons for not inviting the child. Maybe she didn't realize the child wanted to join, or there were other factors. Yelling might not be the best approach to address that. The author's partner also thinks they overreacted, suggesting that the response might have been too intense.\n\nHowever, the parent's frustration is understandable. Ensuring their child isn't excluded is important, especially for a child who might already feel left out. The key is whether the reaction was appropriate. Yelling could have been avoided. A calmer approach might have been more effective in encouraging inclusion without making the other parent defensive.\n\nIn the end, while the intent was to protect their daughter, the method used might have been inappropriate. So the author is probably in the wrong (A), but there are nuances. However, given the options, the answer is A.\n"
