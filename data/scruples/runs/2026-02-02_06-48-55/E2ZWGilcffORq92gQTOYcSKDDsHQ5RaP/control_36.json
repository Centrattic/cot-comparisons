Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who yelled at the mother is in the wrong. The situation involves a disabled daughter being excluded from play by other kids. The parent yells at the mother, accusing her of being embarrassed, then makes a comment about cerebral palsy.\n\nFirst, the parent's intent is to defend their daughter and ensure she's included. That's understandable. But the method used was yelling and making an accusation. Yelling can be seen as aggressive, even if the intent is good. The comment \"she isn't poisonous\" is meant to deflect any stigma, but it might come off as confrontational. \n\nThe mother of the other kids didn't respond, so maybe she was taken aback. The parent's partner thinks they overreacted. The key here is whether the approach was appropriate. While the desire to protect their daughter is valid, yelling and public confrontation might not be the best way. It could have been handled more calmly, maybe by talking to the mother privately. \n\nThe daughter was eventually included, so the outcome was positive, but the method could have been better. Public shaming or yelling might not teach the kids the right way to include others. The parent's reaction might have made the other mother defensive instead of receptive. So, even if the intention was good, the approach was probably wrong. Answer A.\n"
