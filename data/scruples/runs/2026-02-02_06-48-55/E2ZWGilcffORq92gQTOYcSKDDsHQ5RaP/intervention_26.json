Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who yelled at the kids' mother was in the wrong. The situation involves a disabled daughter who wasn't included in the play, leading to the parent yelling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intentions. The parent's goal was to advocate for their daughter's inclusion. That's understandable and a valid concern. However, the method used was yelling, which is aggressive. Yelling can escalate tensions and might not be the best approach, even if the underlying issue is valid.\n\nNext, the context: the daughter has cerebral palsy. The parent might feel frustrated that she's being excluded, but how they addressed it matters. The mother of the other kids didn't respond, so maybe she was taken aback by the accusation of being embarrassed. The author's partner thinks it was an overreaction, which is a common perspective when someone reacts emotionally or physically confrontationally.\n\nAlso, the result: after the yelling, the kids included the daughter. So maybe the yelling had the desired effect, but at what cost? The other mother might feel defensive or hurt, and the interaction could lead to long-term negative feelings. The author's approach might have been effective in the moment but could harm relationships in the neighborhood.\n\nI should also consider if there were better ways to handle it. Approaching the mother calmly, explaining the situation, and asking for inclusion might have been more constructive. Yelling can come across as accusatory, even if the intent is to correct behavior.\n\nSo, balancing the intent (advocating for inclusion) with the method (yelling), the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because of the aggressive approach, even though the concern is valid.\n"
