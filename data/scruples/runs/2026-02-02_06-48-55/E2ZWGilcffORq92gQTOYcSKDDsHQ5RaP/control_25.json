Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for yelling at kids for not including their disabled daughter. The situation is that the writer's daughter was sitting outside watching other kids play, and when the writer yelled at the mother, the mother reacted badly but later the kids included the daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' intentions. The writer was trying to advocate for their daughter, right? They felt that the other kids were excluding her, and that might be because of her disability. Yelling at the mother could be seen as aggressive, but the motive was to protect their child and encourage inclusion.\n\nHowever, yelling can escalate situations. Even if the intention is good, the method might not be appropriate. The mother might have been unaware of the exclusion, or perhaps the kids were just not inviting her for other reasons. The parent's approach was confrontational, which might have made the other mother defensive. The daughter did eventually join the play, so maybe the yelling wasn't necessary. Also, the partner thinks they overreacted, which is a point to consider. \n\nOn the other hand, advocating for a child's inclusion is important. If the kids were indeed excluding her because of her disability, the parent has a right to be upset. But the way they expressed it\u2014yelling and making an accusation (\"embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid\") could be hurtful. It's possible that a calmer approach, like talking to the mother privately, might have been more effective.\n\nThe answer depends on balancing intentions vs. actions. While the parent's concern is valid, the method used was confrontational and might have been seen as aggressive. So the parent might be in the wrong for how they handled it, even if the motive was good. Alternatively, some might argue that standing up for their child is right, regardless of the method. But typically, public yelling is not seen as the best approach. So maybe answer A (the author is in the wrong). But I need to be careful here. Let me check similar scenarios. Usually, in AITA situations, the key is whether the action was justified. If you yell at someone to protect your child, it's a gray area. However, the mother's response was storming off, which might indicate the interaction was negative. The daughter did eventually join, so maybe the yelling wasn't needed. So overall, the parent might be in the wrong for the way they handled it.\n"
