Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who yelled at the kids' mom is in the wrong. The situation involves their disabled daughter being excluded from play by other kids. \n\nFirst, the parent sees their daughter sitting alone while other kids play nearby. They confront the mother, asking if she's embarrassed, which is pretty direct. Then they yell that the daughter isn't poisonous, implying she's safe to be around. The other mom leaves, and later the kids include the daughter.\n\nThe parent's partner thinks they overreacted. The question is whether the parent is at fault. \n\nWell, advocating for a child is natural, especially when they're excluded. The daughter has cerebral palsy, which might make social inclusion harder. The parent's frustration is understandable. However, yelling at another parent, even if well-intentioned, can be seen as aggressive. It might have embarrassed the other mom, leading her to leave. \n\nBut on the flip side, the parent's actions led to the kids including their daughter. Maybe the mom was unaware of the exclusion, and the outburst made the kids realize they should include her. However, the method used was confrontational. A better approach might have been to talk to the other parents calmly.\n\nSo the parent's intentions were good, but the method of confronting the mom with yelling could be seen as wrong. So the answer might be A, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, considering the child's well-being, maybe it's not the parent's fault. Hmm. Need to weigh the intent vs. the action.\n"
