Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves their disabled daughter being excluded by other kids, and they yelled at the mother.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The daughter has cerebral palsy and was sitting outside watching other kids play. The parent got angry and yelled at the mother, saying things like \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid?\" and \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous...\" The parent's partner thinks they overreacted.\n\nSo, the key points here are about inclusion of a disabled child and how the parent handled the situation. The parent is advocating for their child's inclusion, but did they go about it the right way? Yelling might not be the best approach, but does that make them an asshole?\n\nI should consider both sides. The parent wants their child to be included, which is a valid concern. However, yelling at another parent in public could be seen as aggressive and not the best method to resolve the situation. The other mother might have had her own reasons for the kids not including the child, maybe not realizing the exclusion was happening. The parent could have approached it by talking to the mother calmly or even talking to the kids first.\n\nBut the child did end up being included later, which is a positive outcome. The parent's intention was to protect their daughter and ensure she wasn't excluded. However, the method of yelling might have been confrontational and possibly hurt the other parent's feelings unnecessarily. The partner's opinion that they overreacted is valid because yelling can be seen as aggressive rather than constructive.\n\nIn terms of social norms, while advocating for inclusion is right, the approach matters. The parent's actions, although well-intentioned, might have been too confrontational. The other parent's reaction (storming off) could be due to the public confrontation rather than the exclusion itself.\n\nSo, considering all that, the parent might be in the wrong for the way they handled it, even if their intention was good. It's a nuanced situation where the right intention doesn't excuse the method used.\n"
