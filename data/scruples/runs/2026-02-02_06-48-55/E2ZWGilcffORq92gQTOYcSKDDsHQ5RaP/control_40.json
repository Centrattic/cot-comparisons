Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for yelling at kids for not including their disabled daughter. The situation is that the daughter was sitting outside watching other kids play, and the author (or their partner) yelled at the mother, accusing her of being embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid. Then the author made another comment about cerebral palsy and the mother left.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter has a disability, and the parents are concerned about her being included. The mother's reaction was yelling, which might be seen as aggressive. But was it justified? On one hand, advocating for inclusion and standing up for one's child is important. On the other hand, yelling at someone else's mother could be seen as confrontational and unproductive.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) The author's intent was to encourage inclusion, which is a valid concern. 2) The method used was yelling and making accusatory remarks, which might have been harsh. 3) The outcome was that the kids eventually included the daughter, so maybe the yelling had an effect, but was it the right way?\n\nI should also think about social norms. In many cases, people might consider direct confrontation in public situations to be inappropriate, especially when it involves children. However, if the mother didn't realize her children were excluding the disabled child, the author's outburst might have made them aware. But the tone of the accusation (\"embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid\") could come off as insulting, even if the intent was good.\n\nAnother angle: The partner's opinion is that the author overreacted. That's a red flag. If the partner, who is close to the situation, thinks it's excessive, maybe there's validity there. Also, the mother's reaction was to storm off, which might indicate that the comments were hurtful or taken the wrong way.\n\nBut the alternative is that the author's actions led to the daughter being included, which is positive. However, the method used could have caused more harm, like creating a hostile environment or embarrassing the other mother, which might not encourage future inclusion. Maybe a better approach would be to talk to the mother privately or model inclusive behavior without confrontation.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a judgment call. The author's intent was to protect their child's interests, which is understandable. However, the execution might not have been the best. So, depending on the perspective, the answer could swing either way. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, if the method was inappropriate even if the intent was good, then the answer would be A (Yes, in the wrong). But if intent justifies the method, then B (No, not in the wrong). However, generally, in such scenarios, while the intent is important, the method often affects the outcome. So the author might be in the wrong for the aggressive approach despite good intentions.\n"
