Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who yelled at the kids for not including their disabled daughter is in the wrong. The scenario involves a parent seeing their daughter left out of a game by other kids, and reacting with anger. \n\nFirst, the parent's intention was to protect their daughter and advocate for her inclusion. That's understandable, especially when dealing with a disabled child who might feel excluded. But the method used was yelling at the mother, which could be seen as confrontational.\n\nNow, considering the other side, the mother of the kids might have been unaware of the situation. Maybe she didn't notice the exclusion or didn't realize the daughter wanted to join. Yelling at her in front of others could have been embarrassing, and that's probably why she left abruptly. \n\nThe daughter did end up joining the game afterward, so the outcome was positive. But the approach taken by the parent was confrontational. Instead of yelling, maybe a calmer approach could have been more effective, like talking to the mother in a non-confrontational way to explain the situation. \n\nAlso, the parent's partner thought they overreacted. That's a point to consider. While the intention was good, the method could have been better. Yelling might escalate the situation rather than resolve it. \n\nIn terms of social norms, it's important to advocate for inclusion, but how you do it matters. Public shaming or yelling might not be the best approach. It's possible the mother was just having a bad day or missed the opportunity to include the child. \n\nSo, while the parent's actions were driven by a desire to protect their child, the method used was inappropriate. The answer would be that the parent is in the wrong for yelling instead of addressing the situation more calmly and respectfully.\n"
