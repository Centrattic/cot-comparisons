Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who yelled at the other mother is in the wrong. The situation involves their disabled daughter being excluded from a game by other kids. \n\nFirst, the author's daughter was sitting on the veranda watching the kids play. The author felt she wasn't included and confronted the other mom. The author yelled, asking if she was embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid, then added that it's just cerebral palsy. The other mom got upset and left.\n\nSo, the question is whether yelling was the right approach. The author's intention was to protect their daughter, which is understandable. But using public shaming and direct accusations might have been harsh. The other mom might not have realized the kids weren't including the girl, or maybe she was trying to supervise but didn't notice. Yelling could have made her defensive instead of addressing the issue constructively. Also, the daughter did end up getting included later, so maybe a calmer approach could have led to the same result without the conflict. The partner thinks it was overreacting, which adds another perspective. So, considering the method used versus the intent, the author might be in the wrong for the way they handled it, even if the concern was valid.\n"
