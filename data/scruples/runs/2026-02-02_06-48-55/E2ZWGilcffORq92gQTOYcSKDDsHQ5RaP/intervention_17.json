Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for yelling at kids who weren't including their disabled daughter. I need to figure out the answer based on the details provided.\n\nFirst, the context is that the parent saw their daughter excluded by other kids playing. The parent yelled at the mother, making a comment about being embarrassed to be seen with a disabled child and then added that it's just cerebral palsy. The mother left, but eventually the kids included the daughter.\n\nNow, the parent is asking if they're in the wrong. The user thinks they are, but wants to see others' opinions. \n\nI need to weigh the parent's intentions versus their actions. The parent's intention was to advocate for their child, which is understandable. However, yelling and confronting the other parent in a public setting might be seen as aggressive. The mother's reaction was to storm off, which could have been embarrassing for her and the other kids. \n\nOn the other hand, advocating for inclusion is important. But the method used here was confrontational. Maybe a better approach would have been to talk to the mother privately or encourage the kids differently. Yelling might have escalated the situation and could be seen as confrontational, which might not be the best way to handle it. \n\nAlso, public shaming, even if the intent is good, can be counterproductive. The parent's actions might have made the other mother defensive, leading her to leave. However, the daughter did end up being included later, so maybe the parent's actions had a positive outcome. But that's not the point here. The question is about whether the parent was wrong in their actions.\n\nSo, considering the approach taken was confrontational and public, which could be seen as inconsiderate of the other parent's feelings, even if the parent's intent was to protect their child. Therefore, the parent might be in the wrong for how they handled the situation, even with good intentions.\n"
