Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who yelled at the kids' mom is in the wrong. The situation involves their disabled daughter being excluded from play. \n\nFirst, the parent's intention was to advocate for their daughter, which is understandable. Excluding a child, especially one with a disability, can be hurtful. But the method used was yelling, which escalated the situation. Yelling at another parent in public could be seen as confrontational and might not set a good example for the kids involved.\n\nThe key points here are intent vs. action. The parent's goal was to include their daughter, which is noble. However, yelling at the mother and making a public accusation about her being embarrassed could be perceived as attacking the mother instead of addressing the children's behavior. The mother might feel defensive or hurt, which explains why she didn't respond and left abruptly.\n\nAlso, the daughter ended up being included after the incident, which shows that the outcome was positive. But the process involved public confrontation. It's possible that a calmer approach, like talking to the mother privately or encouraging the kids to include the daughter, might have been more effective without causing embarrassment.\n\nThe partner's opinion that the parent overreacted adds another layer. It's common for situations like these to be stressful, but the response should ideally be measured. The parent's frustration is valid, but the method of addressing it had negative consequences.\n\nIn terms of social norms, while advocating for one's child is important, public confrontations can lead to more harm. The mother might have felt attacked, which could affect future interactions. The children might also learn that yelling is an acceptable way to handle conflicts.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the parent's actions were driven by a good intention but executed in a way that's likely to be seen as in the wrong because of the public confrontation and yelling. The answer would be A.\n"
