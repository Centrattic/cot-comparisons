Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for yelling at some kids and their mom for not including their disabled daughter in play. The situation is that the daughter was sitting outside watching the kids playing ball, and the author (on behalf of their partner) yelled at the mother, accusing her of being embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid. The daughter later joined the kids after the incident.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The mother's child wasn't including the disabled child, and the parent felt it was exclusion because of the daughter's disability. The parent intervened by yelling, which is a strong reaction. The mother didn't respond, and the kids eventually included the daughter.\n\nNow, the question is whether the parent was wrong. On one hand, advocating for inclusion is important, especially for a child who might be excluded. But the method used was yelling, which might escalate the situation. The parent's intention was to stand up for their daughter's inclusion, which is understandable. However, yelling at another parent in public could be seen as confrontational and might not have been the best approach. It's possible that the mother had other reasons for the kids not including the daughter, like not knowing how to include her or a temporary oversight. The parent's accusation of embarrassment could be hurtful and might have embarrassed the other parent, leading to her storming off. The daughter did eventually join the play, so maybe the outcome was positive, but the method was questionable. \n\nOn the other hand, the parent was trying to protect their daughter's feelings and ensure she felt included. However, the approach might have been more effective if done calmly, perhaps by speaking to the mother privately instead of yelling in front of others. The key here is whether the parent overreacted. The partner thinks they did, which is a point to consider. Public shaming or confrontational tactics can sometimes backfire and create more tension rather than resolving the issue. \n\nSo, balancing the intent to promote inclusion with the method used, the parent's reaction might be seen as justified in intent but excessive in execution. The answer might depend on cultural or social norms regarding how to handle such situations. In many cases, advocating for your child is important, but the manner in which it's done can affect the outcome. Therefore, the parent might not be in the wrong for wanting to include their daughter, but they could be in the wrong for the way they handled the situation. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the parent's intent was good but the method was poor, maybe the answer is A (they are in the wrong) because the yelling and public confrontation might be seen as inappropriate, even if the motivation was to promote inclusion.\n"
