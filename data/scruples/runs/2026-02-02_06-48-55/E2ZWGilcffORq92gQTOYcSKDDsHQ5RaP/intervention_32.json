Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who yelled at the kids' mom is in the wrong. The situation is that their disabled daughter (with cerebral palsy) wasn't included in the play, so they yelled at the mother.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intent. The parent was trying to protect their daughter and ensure she's included. That's a valid concern. But the method they used was yelling and making a confrontational comment, which might be seen as aggressive. The mother might have felt targeted, even if unintentionally. However, the kids eventually included the daughter, so maybe the mom was unaware of the exclusion. \n\nOn the other hand, advocating for inclusion is important. The parent could argue that they were just standing up for their child. But yelling in public could be seen as overreacting, especially in front of others. The partner thinks it's an overreaction, which adds another perspective. \n\nThere's a balance between asserting your child's right to be included and respecting others' autonomy. Maybe a better approach would be to talk to the mom calmly instead of yelling. But given the emotional context of a parent seeing their child excluded, especially with a disability, it's understandable. \n\nSo, is the parent in the wrong? It's a tough call. The action was confrontational, but the intent was positive. However, the method might have been inappropriate. So, leaning towards A (yes, in the wrong) because of the yelling, but with understanding of their motivation. But maybe some would say B (not in the wrong) because they defended their child. Hmm.\n"
