Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who yelled at the kids' mom was in the wrong. The situation is that their disabled daughter wasn't included in the play, so they yelled to confront the mother.\n\nFirst, the daughter has cerebral palsy. It's important to consider that inclusion is crucial, especially for children with disabilities. The mother might feel frustrated or helpless about her daughter being excluded. But yelling at the other mother could come off as aggressive. The other mom might not have realized the exclusion was intentional or even noticed it. \n\nThe author's intent was to advocate for their daughter, which is understandable. However, the method used was yelling and making a confrontational comment about being embarrassed. That could have been hurtful to the other mother, even if it was a misunderstanding. The other mother's reaction was to storm off, which might indicate she felt attacked rather than approached to include the child.\n\nThe partner's opinion is that the author overreacted. The daughter eventually got included after the yelling, but the approach might have caused more tension than necessary. There's a balance between advocating for inclusion and maintaining a respectful interaction. Yelling might not be the best way to address the issue, especially in public and in front of the children. \n\nIt's possible the other mother didn't realize the exclusion was happening. Maybe she thought the kids were just playing without her daughter. The author could have approached it more calmly, perhaps by asking the other mom to include their daughter gently. \n\nIn summary, while the intent to protect and include their daughter is valid, the method of confrontation through yelling could be seen as inconsiderate and potentially harmful to fostering a positive interaction. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
