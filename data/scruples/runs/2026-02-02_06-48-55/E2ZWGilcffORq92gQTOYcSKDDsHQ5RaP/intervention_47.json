Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me go through the situation step by step.\n\nThe author's daughter is disabled, with cerebral palsy. She was sitting outside watching two kids playing ball, but they didn't include her. The author (as their partner) yells at the mother, asking if she's embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid. Then the author adds another comment about it being just cerebral palsy, not that the kid is poisonous. The mother storms off, and later the kids do include the daughter. The partner thinks the author overreacted.\n\nFirst, I should consider the intent. The author's main concern is that their daughter was excluded. They were trying to protect their child from being left out, which is a valid concern. However, the method used was yelling at the mother, which might not have been the best approach.\n\nNext, the author's actions: yelling at the mother in public. That could be seen as confrontational and possibly hurtful to the mother. Even if the intention was good, yelling might escalate the situation and could make the mother defensive instead of encouraging inclusion. The mother might not have realized her kids weren't including the daughter, but the author's approach might have been too aggressive.\n\nBut the daughter was excluded, which can be hurtful for a child, especially with disabilities who might already feel isolated. The author might have felt that the mother was complicit in the exclusion, even if unintentionally. However, a better approach could have been to talk to the mother calmly after the fact, explaining the situation and encouraging inclusion next time.\n\nThe mother's reaction was to storm off, which might indicate she was upset but the author's yelling could have been a contributing factor. The daughter did eventually get included, which is positive, but the author's method caused immediate conflict.\n\nSo, the key points are: the author's intent was to advocate for their child, but the method was confrontational. While the exclusion is wrong, the way the author addressed it might not have been the most effective or considerate. Therefore, maybe the author is in the wrong for the manner of their response, even if the underlying issue isn't.\n"
