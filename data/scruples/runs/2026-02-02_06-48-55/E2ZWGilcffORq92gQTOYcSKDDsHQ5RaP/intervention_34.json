Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for yelling at kids for not including their disabled daughter. The situation involves the author seeing their daughter excluded from play, then yelling at the mother and the kids to address it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter has cerebral palsy, which is a disability. The kids were playing, and the daughter was watching from a distance. The author's partner didn't see the issue, but the author felt compelled to act. The way they acted was yelling at the mother, which might be seen as aggressive or confrontational.\n\nThe key points here are the intent and the method. The author's intent was to include their daughter, which is a valid and positive goal. However, the method involved yelling and potentially embarrassing the other mother. Yelling, especially in public, can be perceived as confrontational and might not be the best approach, especially when a child is involved.\n\nThe mother's reaction was to storm off, which might indicate that the approach taken was hurtful or unwelcome. While the daughter eventually joined the play, the way it was handled could have been more constructive. Maybe approaching the mother calmly to discuss inclusion would have been better. Yelling might have made the other mother defensive, leading to a situation where the problem wasn't resolved in a positive way.\n\nAlso, the partner's opinion that the author overreacted is another factor. It's possible that there's a cultural or personal norm about how to handle such situations. Public shaming or yelling might not be the accepted method in some communities, even if the intent is good.\n\nHowever, on the other hand, the author's concern for their daughter's inclusion is valid. Children need to learn to include others, and sometimes parents need to step in to correct that. But the method here was aggressive, which might have backfired. \n\nSo considering all these factors, the author's intent was good, but the method was inappropriate. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because yelling isn't the best approach even if the underlying issue is important.\n"
