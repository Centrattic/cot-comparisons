Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for yelling at kids for not including their disabled daughter. The situation involves the daughter wanting to play, the author yelling at the mother, and the kids eventually including her after.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter has cerebral palsy, which makes inclusion important. The author saw their daughter excluded and reacted strongly. Yelling at the mother could be seen as confrontational. Was it justified?\n\nThe mother might have been unaware of the exclusion. The author's approach was public and confrontational, which could have embarrassed the mother. Maybe a better approach was to talk to the mother privately. However, the intention was to advocate for their daughter's inclusion, which is a valid concern.\n\nThe daughter did end up being included after the incident. The partner thinks the author overreacted. Publicly shaming someone, even with good intentions, might not be the best method. The author's words were harsh, which could have damaged relationships. But the underlying issue of inclusion is important.\n\nSo, the author's actions might be seen as wrong because of the method used, even if the intent was good. The answer is likely A (in the wrong). But I need to make sure there's no nuance I'm missing. The key is whether yelling was the appropriate way to address the situation. Probably not, hence the answer is A.\n"
