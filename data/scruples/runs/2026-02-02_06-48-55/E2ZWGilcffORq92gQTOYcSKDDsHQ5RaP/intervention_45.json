Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who yelled at the kids' mom is in the wrong. The situation is about their disabled daughter not being included in a game. The parent got angry and yelled at the other mother, saying things like \"Are you embarrassed...\" and \"It's just cerebral palsy...\"\n\nHmm, so first, the parent's intention was to advocate for their child's inclusion, which is understandable. But they chose to confront the other mother publicly and yelled, which might have been harsh. Even though the kids eventually included the daughter, the parent's reaction could have been more constructive.\n\nThe mother might have had reasons for not including the child\u2014maybe the kids were too young, or they didn't know how to include her. Instead of yelling, approaching the mother calmly to discuss inclusion could have been better. Also, public shaming or yelling might have made the mother defensive, which isn't helpful. The parent's partner thought they overreacted, which adds another perspective.\n\nBut on the other hand, advocating for inclusion is important. However, the method used here could have been more effective. So while the parent had a valid concern, the way they handled it might be wrong. So probably answer A.\n"
