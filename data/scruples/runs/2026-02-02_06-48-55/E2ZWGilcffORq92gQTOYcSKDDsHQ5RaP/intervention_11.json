Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves their daughter with cerebral palsy being excluded by other kids playing outside. The parent yells at the mother of the kids, accusing her of being embarrassed to include their disabled daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter was sitting on the porch watching the kids play. The parent felt she was being excluded, which is a valid concern because inclusion is important. However, the way they handled it was by yelling at the other mother, which might not be the best approach. \n\nYelling can be perceived as confrontational and might make the other parent defensive. Even if the intention was to push for inclusion, the method used could have been more constructive. The parent's words like \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid?\" could come off as accusatory, which might not encourage the other parent to engage. \n\nOn the flip side, the parent's frustration is understandable. They want their child to be included and may feel that the other kids' mother is not doing enough to ensure that. However, there might be other reasons why the kids weren't including the daughter\u2014maybe they didn't know how, or it wasn't intentional. \n\nThe key here is whether the parent's actions were proportionate to the situation. Yelling in public could escalate the situation and possibly lead to embarrassment for everyone involved. The other mother's reaction\u2014storming off\u2014suggests that the confrontation was uncomfortable and unproductive. \n\nThe daughter did eventually get included, so maybe the yelling had the intended effect, but the method was harsh. The partner thinks the parent overreacted, which adds another perspective. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, while the intent was to advocate for their child, the approach taken might not have been the most effective or respectful. It's possible that a calmer, more direct conversation with the other parent could have addressed the issue without confrontation. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong (A) because yelling was an inappropriate response, even if the underlying concern is valid.\n"
