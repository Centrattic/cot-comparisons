Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation involves a parent yelling at other kids' mother because their disabled daughter wasn't included in play. The parent is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the parent's intention was to include their daughter, which is understandable. Exclusion can be hurtful, especially for a child with a disability. But the method used\u2014yelling at another parent and making a confrontational comment like suggesting the mother is embarrassed by a disabled child\u2014might be problematic. \n\nYelling in public can escalate tensions and might not model the behavior they want their child to learn. The comment about being \"embarrassed\" is accusatory and could be perceived as an attack on the mother's character, which is harsh. Even if the intent was to protect their daughter, the approach could have been more effective through direct communication.\n\nOn the other hand, advocating for inclusion is important. The daughter did eventually get included, so maybe the yelling had an immediate effect. However, the parent's actions might have alienated the other family instead of fostering a cooperative relationship. The partner's opinion that they overreacted adds another layer, suggesting that there's a chance the parent's reaction was excessive.\n\nConsidering all this, while the parent's goal was good, the method was confrontational and potentially harmful. So, the answer might lean towards A (in the wrong), but there's nuance. However, the key is whether the parent's actions were justified. Since yelling and accusatory remarks are generally not advisable, even with good intentions, the answer is likely A.\n"
