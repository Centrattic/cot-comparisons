Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong after yelling at kids for not including their disabled daughter. The scenario is that the author saw their daughter being excluded from play by other kids and then yelled at the mother.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter has cerebral palsy, which is a disability. The kids were playing ball, and the daughter was just watching from a chair. The author got angry and yelled at the mother, implying that maybe the mother was embarrassed to be seen with a disabled child. The mother then left, and later the kids included the daughter.\n\nNow, the key points here are about inclusion and the mother's reaction. The author's action was to yell, which might be seen as confrontational. But the motivation was to protect their daughter and ensure she was included. However, yelling might not be the best approach. The mother might have had her own reasons for not engaging, maybe she was busy, or the kids were playing, and the daughter approached on her own. The author's public confrontation could have been more hurtful than helpful.\n\nLegally, yelling isn't necessarily a crime, but socially, it's about how one handles the situation. The author's intention was to advocate for their daughter, which is understandable. But the method\u2014yelling at another parent\u2014could be seen as aggressive. The partner thinks they overreacted, which is a sign that maybe there's a different way to handle it. The daughter ended up being included later, so maybe the yelling wasn't necessary. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, advocating for inclusion is good. On the other, the approach was confrontational and might have embarrassed the mother, leading to her leaving. The mother might have had no control over the kids' actions. The author could have approached the mother calmly to talk instead of yelling. So, while the intent was to help their daughter, the method was possibly wrong. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, in the wrong) because of the approach used, even if the intent is understandable.\n"
