Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves their disabled daughter being excluded by other kids, and they yelled at the mother for not including her. They want to know if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The key points are that the daughter has cerebral palsy, she was sitting outside watching kids play, the parent yelled at the mother of the other kids, and then the kids eventually included the daughter. The partner thinks the parent overreacted.\n\nSo, the parent's intention was to advocate for their daughter, which is understandable. However, the method used was yelling and making an accusation like \"embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid.\" That's pretty harsh and confrontational. Even though the parent's motive was to protect their child, the way they handled it could be seen as aggressive. \n\nBut on the other hand, the kids didn't include the daughter, which might be due to ignorance or not knowing how to include someone with a disability. The parent might feel that standing up for their child was necessary. However, yelling in public and confronting the other mother could have caused embarrassment and might not have set a good example for the kids. The mother's reaction (storming off) suggests that the parent's approach was too intense.\n\nAlso, the daughter eventually joined the game after the parent's outburst, which implies that the parent's action might have led to a positive outcome. But it's important to consider the impact of such a public confrontation. Maybe there were other ways to handle it, like talking to the mother privately or teaching the daughter how to approach the game herself.\n\nIn terms of social norms, while advocating for your child is important, the method of confrontation through yelling might not be the best approach. It's possible that the parent did the right thing in advocating but used the wrong method. However, the intent was to help their child, which is a strong factor.\n\nSo, the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong because they were trying to protect their child. But they could be seen as in the wrong for the way they handled it. The answer hinges on balancing the intent with the method. Since the parent's action was aggressive, even if the motive was good, it might be considered wrong. The community's response would likely split, but the key is whether the parent overstepped in their reaction. Considering all that, I think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because yelling in a public and confrontational manner is not the best approach, even with good intentions.\n"
