Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for yelling at kids for not including their disabled daughter in play. So, the situation is that their daughter was sitting outside watching other kids play, but they weren't including her. The parent got angry and yelled at the mother, saying things like \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid?\" and \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous.\" The kids eventually included her later.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if yelling was the right approach. Yelling can be seen as aggressive, especially in public. Even if the parent was upset about their child being excluded, the method of addressing it might have been inappropriate. Maybe a calmer approach would have been better, like talking to the kids or the mother privately. Also, the parent's comments might have shamed the other mother, which could make her defensive instead of understanding the situation. However, the parent's intent was to advocate for their daughter, which is understandable. The other kids did end up including her, so maybe the yelling had some effect, but it's possible that a different approach could have been more constructive. \n\nThe partner thinks the parent overreacted, which adds another perspective. It's a balance between standing up for one's child and respecting others' feelings. The parent might have felt their daughter was being excluded due to her disability, so their frustration is valid. But the method of confrontation might have crossed a line. So, is it wrong? Maybe. The parent had good intentions but used a harsh method. The answer might be A (in the wrong) because yelling publicly and confronting the mother in that way could be seen as inappropriate, even if the concern was valid.\n"
