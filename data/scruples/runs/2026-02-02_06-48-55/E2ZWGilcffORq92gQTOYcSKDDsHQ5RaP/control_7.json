Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who yelled at the kids' mom for not including their disabled daughter is in the wrong. The situation involves their daughter wanting to play, being excluded, and the parent reacting with yelling.\n\nFirst, the parent's intention was to advocate for their daughter. Excluding a child with a disability can be hurtful and is a form of discrimination. The parent felt their daughter was being left out, so they acted to stand up for her. That's understandable, as parents want their children to be accepted.\n\nHowever, the method used was yelling and making a confrontational comment about being embarrassed. Yelling in public can escalate situations and might be seen as aggressive. The mother of the other kids might have been just as surprised or caught off guard. Maybe she didn't realize the exclusion was happening, or she didn't know how to include the child. Public confrontation might not be the best approach for resolving such a sensitive issue.\n\nThe daughter did end up being included eventually, which is positive. The partner's reaction suggests he thought it was an overreaction. Yelling can sometimes be perceived as hostile, which might not encourage the desired behavior change in the other party. Approaching the situation calmly, perhaps after the fact, could have been more effective. \n\nBut then again, the parent's frustration is valid. Their daughter's feelings matter, and standing up for her inclusion is important. It's a balance between advocating for their child and maintaining a respectful approach. So, is the parent in the wrong? Maybe not entirely, but there's room for a better approach. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong. Since the action was confrontational, possibly AITA might lean towards A (author at fault) because yelling is aggressive. But some might argue B (not the author's fault) because they were defending their child. However, the method used might be the issue here. So the answer could be A.\n"
