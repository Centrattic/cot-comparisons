Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a parent yelling at other kids and their mom for not including their disabled daughter in play.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the scenario. The parent saw their daughter sitting alone while other kids played. They yelled at the mother, making a comment about being embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid. Then they added that it's just cerebral palsy, not poisonous. The other mom left, and later the kids included the daughter.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants others' opinions. The key points here are about how to handle inclusion of a disabled child. Publicly shaming another parent in that way might not be the best approach. Even if the intent was to advocate for their daughter, yelling and confronting someone in public could come off as aggressive or accusatory. It might have made the other mother feel defensive, which could explain why she left. \n\nBut on the other hand, the parent is trying to protect their child and ensure she's included. It's a tough situation. Maybe there are better ways to handle it, like talking to the other parent privately or teaching the daughter how to approach the kids herself. However, the mother's reaction led to the kids including the daughter later, which is positive.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the method they used was confrontational and public, which might have been unnecessary. Even if their intention was good, the approach was harsh. So maybe answer A (Yes, in the wrong) because they yelled and made a personal accusation, which could escalate the situation instead of resolving it.\n"
