Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for yelling at some kids' mother because their disabled daughter wasn't included in play. The situation is that the author saw their daughter sitting alone outside while other kids were playing, and they confronted the mother. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter has cerebral palsy, so inclusion is important. The author was upset because the kids weren't including her, which is a valid concern. People with disabilities often face exclusion, so advocating for their inclusion is right. But the method used was yelling at the mother, which could be seen as confrontational.\n\nThe key points are: was the author's reaction appropriate? Yelling might have been a poor choice. While the intent was to ensure inclusion, yelling could have been aggressive and might not have helped the situation. The mother was taken aback and left, but eventually the kids did include the daughter. \n\nThe partner thinks the author overreacted. The partner's perspective is that maybe a calmer approach would have been better. The outcome was positive in the end, but the method might have been problematic. \n\nIn terms of ethics, is it wrong to act in defense of one's child's inclusion? Not necessarily, but the approach matters. Yelling might not be the most effective way and could have caused embarrassment to the other mother, even if unintentionally. \n\nSo, the author's intent was to help their daughter, which is understandable, but the method was confrontational. Depending on cultural norms, yelling in such situations is often discouraged as it can escalate tensions. However, advocating for inclusion is important. \n\nI think the answer is a balance. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting their child included, but the yelling was the wrong approach. So, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because the method used was inappropriate, even if the intent was good.\n"
