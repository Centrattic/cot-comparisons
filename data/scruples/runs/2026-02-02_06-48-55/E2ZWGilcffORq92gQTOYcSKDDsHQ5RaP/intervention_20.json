Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for yelling at kids for not including their disabled daughter. The situation is that the author saw their daughter sitting alone while other kids played, the mother was watching but didn't include the daughter. The author yelled at the mother, leading to a heated reaction.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter has cerebral palsy, which is a physical disability. The parent is advocating for their child's inclusion, which is important. But the method used was yelling, which can be seen as aggressive. \n\nThe key points here are: Was the parent justified in their reaction? Yelling might have been a result of frustration and a desire to protect their child. However, publicly confronting someone like that could be seen as inconsiderate, even if the intent was good. \n\nThe other mother's reaction (storming off) might indicate she felt attacked, which could have been avoided with a calmer approach. The daughter eventually got included by the kids, so maybe the yelling wasn't necessary. \n\nAlso, the partner thinks the author overreacted. Partners often have a good sense of each other's behaviors. The author's actions might have escalated the situation unnecessarily. \n\nOn the other hand, advocating for inclusion is right, but the method matters. Maybe a kinder approach could have been taken to encourage inclusion without confrontation. \n\nSo, while the intent was to protect the daughter, the method (yelling) might be where the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
