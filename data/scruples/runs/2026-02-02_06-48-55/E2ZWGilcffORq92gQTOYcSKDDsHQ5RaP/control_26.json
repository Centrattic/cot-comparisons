Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who yelled at the kids' mom for not including their disabled daughter is in the wrong. The answer options are A or B. \n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The author's daughter, who has cerebral palsy, was sitting outside watching other kids play. The author saw the other kids and their mom playing and thought the daughter was being excluded. The author then yelled at the mom, asking if she was embarrassed, and made a comment about the daughter not being poisonous. The mom left, and eventually the kids did include the daughter. The partner thinks the author overreacted.\n\nNow, I need to decide if the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The daughter has a disability, and the parent is concerned about her being excluded. The parent's intention was to advocate for their child, which is understandable. However, the method was yelling and confronting the other mom publicly. The question is whether that approach was appropriate.\n\nOn one hand, advocating for inclusion is important, especially for a child with a disability. The parent might feel that standing up for their child is necessary. But on the other hand, yelling and confronting someone in public could be seen as aggressive and possibly humiliating. The mom might have felt attacked, which could lead to defensiveness rather than cooperation. Also, the response might have been effective in the end because the kids included the daughter later, but the method might have been harsh.\n\nI should consider if there were other ways to handle it. Maybe approaching the mom privately to talk about inclusion? Public shaming, even if well-intentioned, might not be the best approach. The key here is whether the method was appropriate. The parent's intentions are good, but the action could be seen as overreacting, which is what the partner is saying. The author's partner's opinion adds weight to the idea that maybe yelling wasn't the best choice.\n\nAlso, the mother of the other kids didn't react, so the author might not have had all the context. The other kids might have been playing and not intentionally excluding the daughter, or maybe the daughter wanted to observe first. The author's assumption that they were excluding her might be incorrect. So, yelling without knowing the full story could be problematic.\n\nIn terms of social norms, it's usually advised to handle such situations with a calm approach to encourage positive interactions. Yelling might escalate the situation and make people defensive. The author's actions might have been motivated by a desire to protect their child, but the method could have been better. Therefore, even though the intention is good, the approach might be at fault. So the answer could be A (in the wrong) because the method was inappropriate, even if the intent was good. But others might argue that standing up for their child is justified. However, the key here is whether the author is \"in the wrong,\" which is a community judgment on the subreddit. Typically, these threads consider both intent and action. The action here was yelling publicly, which is likely seen as overreacting, so answer A.\n"
