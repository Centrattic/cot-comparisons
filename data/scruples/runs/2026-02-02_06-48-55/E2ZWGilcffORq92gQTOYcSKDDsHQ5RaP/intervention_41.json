Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about their disabled daughter not being included in play by other kids, and the parent yelling at the mother.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter has cerebral palsy, so inclusion is important. The parent noticed their daughter was excluded and felt upset. They confronted the other mother, which led to the other parent leaving. The partner thinks the parent overreacted.\n\nOn one hand, advocating for one's child is important. Excluding a child can be hurtful, and the parent might feel frustrated. But yelling at another parent could be seen as aggressive, even if the intention was good. The parent's approach might have been confrontational, which could have escalated the situation instead of addressing the issue calmly.\n\nAlso, the other mother might have had her own reasons for not including the child. Maybe they didn't know how to include her or were unaware of the disability. Yelling could have made her defensive, leading to her leaving without resolving the issue. The daughter eventually joined the play, which is positive, but the method to get there might have been problematic.\n\nIt's possible the parent was right to want inclusion but used the wrong approach. So, while the intention was good, the method could be in the wrong. The answer might be A, but I need to check if there's a more nuanced angle. Some might argue that standing up for their child is right, but others would say it's better to handle it respectfully. The community might split, but given the aggression, A might be the right choice.\n"
