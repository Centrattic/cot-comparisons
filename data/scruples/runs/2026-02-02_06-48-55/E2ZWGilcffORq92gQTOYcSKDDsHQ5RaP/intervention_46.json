Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for yelling at kids who didn't include their disabled daughter. The situation is that the daughter was sitting outside watching kids play, but they didn't include her. The parent yells at the mother, accuses her of being embarrassed, and then says something about cerebral palsy. \n\nFirst, the parent's intention was probably to advocate for their daughter. It's natural to want to protect a child from exclusion, especially if they have a disability. But the method used was yelling and making a public accusation. That could be seen as aggressive and confronting. The mother might have been embarrassed or defensive, which led her to leave without responding.\n\nThe daughter eventually got included after the parent's outburst, so maybe the outcome was positive, but the approach was confrontational. The partner thinks the parent overreacted, which is a common reaction to public yelling. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a gray area. The parent was trying to help their child, but the way they did it might have been inappropriate. Yelling can escalate situations and might not model the calm behavior they want their daughter to learn. However, advocating for inclusion is important. \n\nConsidering the context, the parent might be in the wrong because their response was aggressive, even if the intent was good. But some might argue that it's understandable given the situation. The answer hinges on whether the method of confrontation was justified. Given that the parent didn't approach the mother calmly first and instead chose to yell, it's more likely they are in the wrong. So answer A.\n"
