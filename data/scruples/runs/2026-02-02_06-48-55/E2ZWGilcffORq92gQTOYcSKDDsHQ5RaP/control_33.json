Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a parent yelling at other kids and their mom because their disabled daughter wasn't included in play. The parent (the author's partner) yelled at the mother, even going as far as saying things like \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid?\" and \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything.\" The kids eventually included the daughter after the incident.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The parent was trying to protect their daughter by advocating for her to be included. On one hand, it's important to include children with disabilities in social activities, promoting inclusivity. On the other hand, the method used was yelling, which might be seen as aggressive or confrontational. \n\nThe mother's response (storming off) could indicate she was upset, but the author's partner's approach might not have been the best way to handle the situation. While the intention was good, yelling might have escalated the situation rather than resolving it. \n\nThe daughter did eventually get included, but maybe there were better ways to achieve that without confrontation. The partner's view that the author overreacted suggests that the method was excessive. \n\nHowever, the parent might have felt defensive about their child's exclusion. The challenge is balancing advocacy with respect for others' reactions. The key is whether the yelling was a justified response or if it crossed a line.\n\nIn terms of social norms, while standing up for one's child is understandable, public confrontation can be seen as inappropriate. The author might be in the wrong for handling it in a way that could have caused embarrassment or hostility towards the other parent, even if their intent was good. \n\nSo, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because while the intent was to advocate for inclusion, the method used was confrontational and potentially hurtful, which is not the best approach. The right thing would have been to address the issue more calmly and perhaps talk to the mother privately to encourage inclusion without yelling.\n"
