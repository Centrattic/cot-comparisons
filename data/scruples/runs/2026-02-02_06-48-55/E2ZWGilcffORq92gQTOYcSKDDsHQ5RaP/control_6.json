Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who yelled at the kids' mom is in the wrong. The situation involves a disabled daughter being excluded from play.\n\nFirst, the daughter was sitting outside watching other kids play. The parent noticed this and confronted the other mom. The key points here are the parent's intent and the method used. The parent was trying to advocate for their child's inclusion, which is a valid concern. However, the approach was yelling and making a personal accusation about the mother being embarrassed. That could be seen as aggressive and confrontational.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent's motivation is to protect their child and ensure she's included. The daughter later joined the game, so maybe the confrontation had a positive outcome. But using public shaming and yelling might have caused more harm, potentially embarrassing the other mom and creating tension. The partner thinks it was an overreaction, which adds another perspective.\n\nI need to consider whether the method of confrontation was appropriate. While the intent was good, yelling and making accusatory remarks can be seen as inconsiderate. There might have been a better way to address the situation without escalating it. So, the parent might be in the wrong for the approach, even if the concern was valid.\n"
