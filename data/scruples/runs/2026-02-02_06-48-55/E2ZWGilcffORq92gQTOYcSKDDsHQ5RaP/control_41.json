Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for yelling at kids who didn't include their disabled daughter. The situation involves a mother (or the partner, as they mentioned they were asking on behalf of their partner) yelling at another mother's kids for not including their daughter in play. The daughter has cerebral palsy and was sitting on the veranda watching the kids play. The author yells at the mother first, then follows up with a comment about the disability, leading the other mother to storm off. The daughter then goes back out and the kids include her.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are: the author's intent was to protect their daughter from exclusion, but the method they used was yelling at the other mother. The partner thinks they overreacted. The other mother didn't respond, but her kids eventually included the daughter. The author's actions were confrontational. \n\nI need to consider social norms here. Yelling in public can be seen as aggressive, even if the intention is good. The mother might have felt that her children were being excluded, but confronting the other mother in a loud manner might not be the best approach. The other mother might have felt blamed, even if the exclusion was unintentional. It's possible that the kids weren't aware of including the daughter, and a more diplomatic approach could have been better. \n\nAlso, the daughter's reaction: she went back out and the kids included her. So maybe the situation resolved itself, but the author's approach could have been more constructive. The partner's opinion that they overreacted adds another layer. \n\nIn terms of accountability, while the exclusion of a disabled child is wrong, the method of addressing it matters. Yelling might escalate the situation and could be seen as inconsiderate of the other mother's perspective. The author's words were confrontational and potentially offensive to the other mother, even if the intent was to advocate for their daughter. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because their reaction was excessive and confrontational, even if the underlying issue of inclusion is valid. There might be better ways to handle such situations without public confrontation.\n"
