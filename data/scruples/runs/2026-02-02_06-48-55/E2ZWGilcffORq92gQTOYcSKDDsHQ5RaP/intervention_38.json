Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for yelling at other kids for not including their disabled daughter. The situation is that their daughter was sitting outside watching other kids play, and the author yelled at the mother, accusing her of being embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid. Then the author made a comment about cerebral palsy, which caused the other mom to leave.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author overreacted. The partner thinks they did. The daughter ended up being included later, but the method used was yelling and confrontational. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the intent. The author wanted to protect their daughter and advocate for her inclusion. That's understandable. But the way they did it was through yelling and public confrontation. Yelling at another person can be seen as aggressive, even if the cause is just. The comment about cerebral palsy might come off as defensive or even offensive, depending on tone and context.\n\nAlso, the mother of the other kids might have had reasons for not including the author's daughter that weren't about disability. Maybe the kids were too young to understand, or there was a misunderstanding about the daughter's needs. Publicly shaming the mother could have made her defensive, leading to her withdrawal. It's possible that a different approach, like talking to the mother privately or encouraging the kids in another way, might have been more effective and respectful.\n\nBut on the flip side, the daughter's rights to inclusion are important. The author might have felt that the other kids were excluding her without reason, so they acted to stop that. However, using a confrontational approach might not set a good example for the daughter or resolve the issue in the long term.\n\nI think the key here is that while the intention was good, the method was inappropriate. Yelling and confrontational behavior can be seen as inconsiderate, even if the cause is valid. The author's partner's opinion that they overreacted adds another layer, suggesting that the reaction was excessive. The fact that the daughter was eventually included might mean the outcome was positive, but the means used could have been harmful to relationships with neighbors.\n\nSo, considering all that, I would say the author is in the wrong. The correct answer is A.\n"
