Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who yelled at the kids' mom is in the wrong. The situation involves a disabled child being excluded from play. The parent (the author) saw their daughter sitting alone while other kids were playing and decided to confront the mother.\n\nFirst, the intent is important. The parent wanted to include their child, which is understandable, especially if the kids weren't including the daughter. Cerebral palsy might affect how the child plays, but that doesn't mean she's a bad kid. However, the method used was yelling. Yelling can escalate tension and might not be the best approach, even if the parent is frustrated.\n\nThe question is whether the reaction was justified. Exclusion can be hurtful, and parents want their kids to feel included. But confronting someone with an accusatory question like \"Are you embarrassed...\" is aggressive. It's possible the mother had a reason the kids weren't including the daughter, like not knowing how to interact with her. A better approach might have been to approach the mother calmly, explain the situation, and encourage inclusion without confrontation.\n\nThe daughter did eventually join the play, so maybe the yelling led to a positive outcome. But that doesn't necessarily justify the method. The parent's partner thinks they overreacted, which is a sign that their response was out of line. Public shaming or yelling can damage relationships and set a bad example for the child.\n\nIn conclusion, while the intent was good, the method was poor. The author is in the wrong because yelling is not an appropriate way to handle the situation, even if the goal was to protect their child's inclusion.\n"
