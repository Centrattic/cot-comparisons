Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The situation is about a parent yelling at other kids for not including their disabled daughter. The user is asking if the author is at fault here. \n\nFirst, the main points: The daughter is disabled (cerebral palsy) and was sitting outside watching other kids play. The parent saw this and got upset, yelling at the kids' mother. The mother didn't include the child, and the parent confronted her. The kids later included the daughter, but the mother was shocked by the yelling.\n\nSo, the key issue is whether yelling was the right approach. The parent's intention was to advocate for their child's inclusion, which is understandable. However, the method used was confrontational and public. Yelling at someone, even if you're upset, can be seen as aggressive. It's important to consider if there were other ways to address the situation, like approaching the mother calmly first to talk about inclusion.\n\nThe mother of the other kids didn't do anything to prevent the inclusion, but the parent assumed she was embarrassed. That's an assumption without evidence. Maybe the kids just didn't invite her daughter yet, not out of malice. The parent's reaction might have been a knee-jerk response to protect their child's feelings, but yelling could have escalated tensions or made the other mother defensive.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent's concern for their child's inclusion is valid. Children with disabilities often face social challenges, and advocating for them is important. However, the approach here was confrontational. It's possible that a more constructive method, like discussing with the other mother later or encouraging the kids to include the daughter, could have been more effective without causing embarrassment.\n\nThe daughter did end up being included after the incident, so maybe the parent's actions prompted that. But the question is about whether the parent was wrong. Yelling publicly might not be the best way to handle such a situation, even with good intentions. There's a difference between standing up for your child and being confrontational.\n\nAlso, the partner thinks the parent overreacted. That's a sign that maybe the reaction wasn't measured. The parent might have been trying to protect their child's feelings, but the method used was harsh. \n\nIn summary, while the parent's intentions were good, the method of addressing the situation was likely inappropriate. The answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because yelling in public and making assumptions about someone's intentions can be seen as aggressive and not the best way to resolve the issue. However, there's a balance between defending one's child and being respectful. It's a judgment call, but the answer here seems to lean towards A.\n"
