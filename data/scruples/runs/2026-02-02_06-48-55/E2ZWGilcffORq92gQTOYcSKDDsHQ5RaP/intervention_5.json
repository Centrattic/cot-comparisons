Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for yelling at the kids' mom. The situation is about their disabled daughter not being included in play. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author's daughter was sitting outside watching other kids play. The author went out and yelled at the mother for not including the child. The daughter later joined the kids when they included her. The partner thinks the author overreacted.\n\nSo, the key points here: The author's intention was to include their disabled daughter, which is a valid and important concern. However, the method used was yelling, which can be seen as aggressive. The question is whether the reaction was justified.\n\nOn one hand, advocating for inclusion is right. The author wanted to ensure their daughter wasn't excluded. On the other hand, yelling at the mother might have been an overreaction and could have made the mother defensive instead of encouraging inclusion. The mother might have been unaware or had her own reasons for the kids not to include the child, like uncertainty about how to interact.\n\nThe daughter did eventually join the game when the kids included her, so maybe the situation resolved itself. But the author's approach might have escalated things unnecessarily. Yelling can sometimes create tension and might not set a good example for the daughter. The partner's opinion that it was overreacting adds another perspective.\n\nSo, while the intent is good, the method (yelling) might be considered wrong because it's not constructive. It's possible the mother was simply unaware or needed a gentle prompt instead of confrontation. The author could have approached the mother calmly to explain the situation, which might have led to a better outcome without the conflict.\n"
