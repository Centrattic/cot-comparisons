Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who yelled at the kids' mom was in the wrong. The scenario is that their daughter with cerebral palsy was sitting outside watching other kids play, and the parent yelled at the mother for not including her. The kids eventually included the daughter later.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intent. The parent was trying to defend their child and advocate for inclusion. It's understandable that they felt frustrated seeing their daughter left out. Cerebral palsy might make social interactions challenging, so inclusion is important for her self-esteem.\n\nBut the method used was yelling at another parent. Yelling can be seen as aggressive and might not set a good example. The mother's reaction could have been defensive, leading to a confrontation. The daughter ended up joining the kids after, so maybe the yelling had the desired effect, but the approach was harsh.\n\nHowever, the parent's intention was to support their child. They might have felt that the other mother was excluding the child intentionally, which is a different scenario. The key point is whether yelling was the right approach. While the goal is good, the method could be questioned. Maybe approaching the mother calmly to explain the situation would have been better. So, the parent's actions were driven by a protective instinct, but the reaction might have been excessive. \n\nIn terms of cultural norms, yelling in public can be seen as inappropriate, especially when addressing another parent. The outcome was positive since the daughter was included later, but the process involved conflict. So, while the parent's intent was good, the method could be considered wrong. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because yelling wasn't the best approach, even if the motive was right.\n"
