Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for yelling at kids not including their disabled daughter. The scenario is that the author's daughter was sitting outside watching other kids play, and the author yelled at the mother, saying things like \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid?\" and \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous.\" Then the kids eventually included the daughter.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. Let me break it down. First, the author's intention was to defend their daughter's right to be included, which is understandable. However, the method used was yelling and confronting the mother. Yelling can be seen as aggressive, even if the intent is good. The mother might have been taken aback and didn't have a chance to respond, which could have led to a better resolution. Also, the author's partner thinks they overreacted, which adds another perspective.\n\nOn the other hand, the kids did eventually include the daughter, so maybe the outcome was positive. But the manner in which it was handled could have been more constructive. Maybe approaching the mother calmly and asking if the kids could include the daughter would have been more effective and respectful. Yelling might escalate the situation and could make the other parent defensive instead of cooperative.\n\nAnother angle is that the author felt their daughter was being excluded, which is a valid concern. However, using public confrontation might not be the best approach. The author's frustration is understandable, but it's important to consider how to address the issue without causing embarrassment or conflict. Maybe next time, a more diplomatic approach could be better. So, while the intent was good, the method was poor. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they chose an aggressive approach that could have been avoided.\n"
