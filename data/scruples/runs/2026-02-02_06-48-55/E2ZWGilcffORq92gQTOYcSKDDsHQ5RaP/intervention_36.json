Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a parent (the author) yelling at another mother because their disabled daughter was excluded from kids playing ball. The author's daughter has cerebral palsy and was sitting on the veranda watching the kids play. The author went out and confronted the mother, even saying things like \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid?\" and \"She isn't poisonous.\" Then the mother left, and eventually the kids included the daughter.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author's reaction was justified or if they overreacted. The partner thinks they overreacted, but the author believes they were right to stand up for their child. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the intent. The author's goal was to include their daughter, which is a good intention. However, the method used was yelling at the mother and making accusatory statements. That's where the potential issue lies. Instead of approaching the situation calmly, perhaps by talking to the mother respectfully or encouraging the kids to include their daughter, the author chose to confront her in a public and emotional way. \n\nThen there's the impact. The mother was shocked, and the author's daughter had to move her chair. Even though the kids eventually included her, the initial approach might have been counterproductive. Yelling could have made the other mother defensive, causing her to leave, which might not have helped the daughter's social interaction. \n\nAnother angle is the parent's responsibility. The other mother was present and supervising the kids, so maybe the author could have approached her in a more constructive manner. Instead, by yelling, the author might have put the mother on the spot, making her feel embarrassed or attacked, which might not have been the best way to address the issue. \n\nAlso, the daughter's reaction: she followed the author inside but then went back and was included. It's possible that the daughter wanted to play but felt the situation was too tense after the yelling. Or maybe the kids realized their mistake once the mother left. \n\nBut the key point here is the method of intervention. While advocating for one's child is important, especially when they're being excluded, the approach matters. Yelling and making accusatory remarks, even if from a place of concern, can come across as aggressive and might not resolve the underlying issue. It could even harm future interactions, as the other mother might now be less inclined to invite the author's daughter to play again due to the confrontation. \n\nOn the other hand, if the daughter had been consistently excluded and the parent felt that a direct approach was necessary, maybe there's some justification. However, in this specific instance, the mother was there and could have been approached more respectfully. The author could have first tried to talk to the kids, or maybe the other mother, to encourage inclusion without the yelling. \n\nSo, considering the intent and the method, the author's actions might be seen as justified in wanting to include their child, but the way they handled it could have been better. The answer might depend on cultural context or how the situation is perceived. But generally, using yelling and confrontational language might be considered overreacting, even if the intention was good. Therefore, the author could be at fault for the approach rather than the concern itself.\n"
