Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for yelling at kids who didn't include their disabled daughter in play. They observed their daughter sitting alone while other kids played nearby. The parent confronts the mother with a confrontational question about being embarrassed and then makes a comment about cerebral palsy.\n\nFirst, the parent's intent is to protect their daughter and ensure she's included. That's understandable. But the method they used was yelling and making accusatory statements. Yelling at the other mother might have been an overreaction. The parent could have approached the situation calmly, maybe asked the mother to encourage their kids to include the daughter. The way they chose to communicate was confrontational, which could have made the other mother defensive instead of cooperative. The daughter did get included eventually after the parent yelled, but the approach might have caused more harm in terms of the interaction between the parents. The partner thinks they overreacted, which adds another perspective. So, while the parent's intention was good, the method was likely inappropriate. They should consider more constructive ways to address such situations in the future.\n"
