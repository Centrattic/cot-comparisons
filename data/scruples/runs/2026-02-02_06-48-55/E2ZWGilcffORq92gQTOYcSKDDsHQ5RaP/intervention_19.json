Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a parent (the author) yelling at other kids and their mother for not including their disabled daughter in play. The daughter has cerebral palsy and was sitting outside watching the kids play. The author went out, yelled at the mother, and then the mother left. The daughter ended up being included later.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author's intention was to protect their child and advocate for inclusion. But the method used was yelling at the mother, which might be seen as confrontational. The mother might have had reasons for not including the child that aren't immediately apparent\u2014maybe the kids weren't being exclusive, or there was a misunderstanding. The author's approach could have been more direct but less aggressive. However, the underlying issue is about inclusion and the child's needs.\n\nNow, considering the options: A (Yes, in the wrong) or B (No). The key factors are whether the author's actions were justified. While the intent to include their daughter is valid, yelling at the mother might not be the best approach. It's possible the mother was unaware of how to include the child or was distracted. The author's outburst could have been hurtful and counterproductive. However, the mother's reaction might have been to the confrontation rather than the inclusion issue. The daughter did eventually get included, so maybe the outcome was positive, but the method could be questioned.\n\nOn the other hand, advocating for a child's inclusion is important, especially if they're being excluded. The author might have felt frustrated and acted on emotion. It's a balance between standing up for their child and respecting the other parent. Maybe there's a middle ground, like approaching the mother calmly to explain the situation instead of yelling. \n\nIn similar situations, people often argue that while the intent is good, the approach matters. Yelling can escalate tensions and prevent constructive dialogue. So, the author might be in the wrong for the method used, even if the goal was right. However, the context of a parent trying to ensure their child isn't excluded adds complexity. \n\nI think the answer leans towards A because the author chose a confrontational method. But it's a nuanced case. The mother might not have been excluding the child on purpose, so yelling could have been an overreaction. The partner's opinion that it was an overreaction also suggests that maybe a calmer approach would have been better. The daughter eventually joined in, so the outcome was positive, but the process was problematic. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
