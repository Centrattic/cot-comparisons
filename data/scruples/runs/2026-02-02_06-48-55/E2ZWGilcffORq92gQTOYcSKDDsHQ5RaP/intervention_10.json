Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a parent yelling at other kids and their mom because their daughter with cerebral palsy wasn't included in a game. The parent then yells, asking if the mother is embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid. The kids eventually include their daughter later.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's intentions. They wanted their child to be included, which is totally valid. Kids can be cruel, and exclusion can be hurtful. But the way they handled it was by yelling at another parent. Yelling might not be the best approach. It's aggressive and could make the other parent defensive, which might prevent the problem from being resolved.\n\nAlso, the parent's comments about being embarrassed and the disability might come off as confrontational. Instead of addressing the kids' exclusion directly, they targeted the mother, which could cause her to react negatively, like storming off. The other parent might not have realized the exclusion was happening, or if she did, maybe she didn't know how to handle it. Yelling might not encourage her to include the child; instead, it could create tension between the families.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent's concern is about their child's inclusion and well-being. They might feel frustrated that despite their daughter's efforts, the other kids aren't including her. The partner thinks they overreacted, which suggests that the parent's response was more intense than necessary. \n\nThere's also the aspect of the daughter's actions. After the yelling, the daughter went back out and the kids included her. Maybe the parent's outburst inadvertently prompted them to include her, but that's not a good way to handle things. The parent should have tried a calmer approach first, like talking to the other parent or the kids directly to encourage inclusion.\n\nIn terms of social norms, while advocating for one's child is important, the method matters. Yelling in public could be seen as inappropriate and might not set a good example for the daughter. It's possible that a more respectful conversation would have been more effective and less confrontational.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the parent's intentions are good, but the approach was flawed. They're in the wrong because they chose to yell and confront the other parent instead of addressing the issue in a constructive way. The answer is A.\n"
