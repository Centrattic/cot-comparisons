Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who yelled at the kids for not including their disabled daughter was in the wrong. The situation is that the daughter was sitting on the veranda watching other kids play, and the parent got upset and yelled at the mother.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter has cerebral palsy, which makes it a disability issue. The parent felt that the kids were excluding her, which can be a sensitive situation. Parents often want their children to be included, especially if they're in a vulnerable position. But the parent chose to yell at the other mother, which escalated things. \n\nThe key points here are the parent's actions: yelling and making a confrontational statement about being embarrassed. Even if the parent's intention was to advocate for their daughter, the method might be questionable. Yelling can be seen as aggressive, and publicly shaming someone might not be the best approach. The other mother's reaction was to leave, which suggests the interaction was uncomfortable for her.\n\nOn the other hand, the daughter was included after she went back out, so maybe the kids weren't intentionally excluding her. The parent's partner thought they overreacted, which adds another perspective. The question is whether the parent's reaction was justified given their concern for their daughter's inclusion.\n\nIn terms of social norms, it's generally encouraged to handle situations calmly and respectfully, even when upset. But defending a child's right to be included is understandable. The parent's intention was likely to protect their daughter, but the method could have been more constructive. Maybe approaching the mother privately or involving the kids in a friendly way could have been better.\n\nSo, considering all that, the parent might be in the wrong for the way they handled it, even if the underlying issue isn't their fault. The answer might be A (Yes), because the approach was confrontational and could have been handled more effectively without yelling. But there's a balance between defending their child and being respectful. Different people might have different views, but the question is about being in the wrong, not just whether the approach was the best. Yelling and public confrontation can be seen as wrong, so maybe A is the answer.\n"
