Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for yelling at kids and their mother for not including their disabled daughter. The situation involves the daughter sitting outside watching other kids play, then the author yells at the mother and the kids, and eventually the kids include the daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The daughter has cerebral palsy, which is a physical disability. She was sitting on the veranda watching the kids play. The author yells at the mother, implying that the mother is embarrassed to have her disabled daughter around. The author's partner thinks they overreacted.\n\nSo, from a moral standpoint, the author's intention was to advocate for their daughter's inclusion, which is understandable. However, the method used was yelling and confronting the mother publicly. This could be seen as aggressive and possibly shaming the mother. The mother might not have been aware of the daughter's presence or the situation, or she might have had her own reasons for not including her child. \n\nThe author's approach might have been confrontational, which can sometimes make others defensive. The mother's reaction\u2014storming off\u2014suggests that the author's words hurt or offended her. Public shaming, even with good intentions, can be counterproductive. It's possible that the mother was unaware of the daughter's disability or didn't know how to include her, and a yelling approach might not have been the best way to address the issue.\n\nOn the other hand, advocating for inclusion is important, especially for a child with disabilities. The daughter did end up included later, so maybe the outburst had an effect. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key here is the method. While the intent was good, yelling might be seen as inappropriate. The mother might not be responsible for the other children's actions, and the approach could have been more constructive, like talking to her calmly or reaching out to the other parents to encourage inclusion without confrontation.\n\nIn terms of social norms, public shaming is often discouraged. People might argue that the author should have approached the mother privately to discuss the situation. Also, the author's partner thinks they overreacted, which suggests that their reaction was excessive in the eyes of someone close to them.\n\nSo, balancing intent vs. method, the author might not be entirely wrong for wanting inclusion, but the way they handled it could be seen as wrong. Hence, the answer might be A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because of the aggressive approach, despite good intentions.\n"
