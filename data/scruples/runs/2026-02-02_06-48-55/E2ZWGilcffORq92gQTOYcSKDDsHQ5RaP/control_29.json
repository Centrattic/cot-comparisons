Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is at fault for yelling at kids for not including their disabled daughter. The situation is that the author's daughter was sitting outside watching other kids play, and when the author saw this, they yelled at the mother and the kids.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter has cerebral palsy, which is a physical disability. The author's intention was to advocate for her inclusion. But the method they used was yelling, which might be seen as aggressive. The mother was taken aback, and the kids eventually included the daughter after the incident.\n\nNow, thinking about social norms and appropriate behavior. Advocating for a child's inclusion is important, but the approach matters. Yelling in public might escalate the situation and could be perceived as confrontational. The partner's reaction suggests that the author might have overreacted. The daughter did end up being included, but the way it happened might have caused embarrassment or stress to the other family.\n\nAlso, considering if there's a better way. Maybe approaching the mother calmly to discuss inclusion instead of yelling. The author's frustration is understandable, but public outbursts can have negative consequences, like making the other parent defensive. The question is whether the ends justify the means. Even though the outcome was positive, the method used might not be acceptable. So, the author might be in the wrong for handling the situation poorly, even with good intentions.\n"
