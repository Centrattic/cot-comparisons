Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's daughter is disabled, specifically with cerebral palsy, and she was sitting outside watching other kids play. The author went out and yelled at the mother of the kids, accusing her of being embarrassed to include their daughter. Then the mother left, but later the kids did include the daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intent of the author's actions. They were trying to protect their daughter's feelings and ensure she was included. But yelling at the mother might have been a harsh way to handle it. The author's goal was good, but the method could be questionable. Yelling can be confrontational and might not have been the best approach. The mother might have felt attacked, which isn't helpful in encouraging inclusion. Also, it's possible the mother didn't realize the kids weren't including the daughter intentionally. The author could have approached the situation more calmly, maybe spoken to the mother respectfully or even talked directly to the kids. By yelling, the author might have made the mother defensive, leading her to leave instead of addressing the issue. However, the daughter ended up being included, so maybe the outcome was positive, but the method was confrontational. The partner's view that the author overreacted suggests there's a different perspective. So, the answer is tricky. But the key point is whether the yelling was justified. Since yelling is a form of aggression and might not have been necessary to achieve the desired outcome, the author might be in the wrong for the method used, even if the intention was right.\n"
