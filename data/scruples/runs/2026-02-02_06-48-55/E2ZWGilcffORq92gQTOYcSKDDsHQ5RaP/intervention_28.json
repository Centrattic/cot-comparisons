Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who yelled at another mom for not including their disabled daughter in play was in the wrong. The situation involves the author's daughter sitting outside and not being included in the kids' game. The author yells at the mother, which leads to the mother storming off, and later the kids include the daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter has a disability, so inclusion is important. However, the method used was yelling, which can be confrontational. The question is whether the means justified the end. \n\nOn one hand, advocating for inclusion is good, and the mother might have felt her daughter was being excluded. But yelling at the other parent in public could be seen as aggressive. Maybe the author could have approached it differently, like talking to the mother calmly or involving the partner first. The partner's reaction suggests he thought it was an overreaction. \n\nAlso, the outcome was positive\u2014the kids did include the daughter after. But the immediate reaction was confrontational. The key issue is whether the yelling was the right approach. \n\nIn terms of social norms, yelling in public can escalate situations and might not model the behavior we want for our children. It's important to address the issue, but the method matters. The author's intent was to protect their daughter's inclusion, but the approach could have been more effective. \n\nSo, the answer would lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because while the intention was to advocate for inclusion, the method of yelling was inappropriate and confrontational. There might have been better ways to handle the situation without causing conflict.\n"
