Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who yelled at the kids' mom is in the wrong. The situation involves their disabled daughter being excluded from play. \n\nFirst, the context is important. The daughter was sitting outside watching others play. The author decided to confront the mother by yelling, which led to the mother leaving. The daughter ended up included later.\n\nNow, considering the act of yelling. Yelling is often seen as aggressive, even if the intention is good. The author's intent was to include their daughter, which is understandable. But the method of confronting the mother in public might be seen as harsh. The mother might have been unaware of the exclusion, or maybe there was another reason. The author didn't give her a chance to explain, just accused her of being embarrassed. That could be unfair.\n\nAlso, the daughter did end up included eventually, so maybe the yelling wasn't necessary. The partner thinks the author overreacted, and that's a point to consider. However, advocating for a child's inclusion is valid. The key here is the approach. Was there a better way to handle it? Maybe talking to the mother privately instead of yelling. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Even if the intention is good, yelling in a public confrontation could be seen as inconsiderate. The mother might have felt attacked, which isn't helpful for fostering inclusion. So the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong because of the confrontational method, even if the concern is valid.\n"
