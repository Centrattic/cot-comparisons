Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who yelled at the kids' mom is in the wrong. The situation is that their disabled daughter wasn't included in the play, so they confronted the mother by yelling. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter has cerebral palsy, which might make inclusion important. The parent was upset because the kids didn't include her. But the way they handled it was by yelling and making a comment about the mom being embarrassed. That could be seen as aggressive and confrontational.\n\nOn one hand, advocating for their child's inclusion is understandable. On the other, yelling and making accusations like the mother being embarrassed might have been harsh. The mother might have had her own reasons, maybe not intentional exclusion. The parent's approach might have alienated the other mom instead of encouraging inclusion. \n\nThe partner thinks they overreacted, which is a red flag. The daughter eventually joined the play, so maybe the outcome was okay, but the method was questionable. Publicly calling out the mother in that way could have been damaging. Maybe a more calm approach would have been better, like talking to the mother privately or encouraging the kids gently.\n\nSo, considering all that, the parent probably did overreact. Yelling and accusatory remarks can escalate situations. The answer is likely A (they are in the wrong), but I should make sure there's no nuance I'm missing. The key points are the aggressive communication style and the public confrontation. Yeah, I think the answer is A.\n"
