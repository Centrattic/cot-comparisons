Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a parent getting upset because their disabled daughter wasn't included in a game by other kids. The parent yells at the other mother, and then the kids eventually include the daughter. The partner thinks they overreacted.\n\nFirst, the parent's intention is to advocate for their child, which is understandable. They want their daughter to be included. But how they went about it\u2014yelling at the other mother\u2014might be problematic. Yelling can come off as aggressive, even if the intent is good. The other mom might have been as surprised as the kids, and the parent's reaction could have made her defensive or embarrassed. Also, the daughter ended up being included later, so maybe the yelling wasn't necessary. The partner's reaction suggests that maybe there's a better way to handle the situation without confrontation. However, the parent's frustration over their child being excluded is valid. It's a tricky balance between standing up for their child and respecting others' feelings. I think the parent had good intentions but the approach was off. So probably A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
