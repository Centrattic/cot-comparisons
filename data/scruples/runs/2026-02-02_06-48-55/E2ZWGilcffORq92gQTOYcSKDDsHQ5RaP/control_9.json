Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for yelling at the kids' mom for not including their disabled daughter in the game.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's daughter is sitting outside watching two kids playing, and the kids' mom is nearby. The author yells at the mom, asking if she's embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid. Then the mom leaves, and the daughter eventually gets included.\n\nThe key points here are about inclusion and how the author handled it. The daughter has cerebral palsy, so it's important that she's included in social activities. The author's reaction was to yell, which is aggressive. But was the mom actually excluding the kid or just not facilitating the inclusion? Maybe the kids didn't realize they could include her, or the mom wasn't aware the daughter wanted to join.\n\nThe author's approach was confrontational. Yelling at the mom might have made the mom defensive instead of addressing the situation constructively. The author could have approached the mom calmly to ask if the daughter could join, fostering a better interaction. However, the author's intent was to ensure inclusion, which is valid. But the method was aggressive, which could be seen as wrong because it didn't allow for a polite solution. The daughter did end up joining later, so maybe the yelling wasn't necessary. The partner's opinion that the author overreacted is a point to consider. So, the author might be in the wrong because yelling isn't the best approach, even if the intent was good.\n"
