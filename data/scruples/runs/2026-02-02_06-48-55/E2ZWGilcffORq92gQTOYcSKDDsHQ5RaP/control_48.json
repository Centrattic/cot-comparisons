Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who yelled at the kids for not including their disabled daughter is in the wrong. The situation is that the daughter was sitting outside watching other kids play, and the parent yelled at the mother of the kids, asking if she was embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid. Then, when the daughter was left out, the parent made another comment about cerebral palsy. The kids eventually included the daughter after the parent yelled.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parent is advocating for their child, which is a valid concern. However, the method used was yelling and confronting the other mother directly in a public setting. That approach might have been confrontational and could have come across as accusatory, which might not be the best way to handle the situation.\n\nBut on the other hand, the parent's intention was to protect their child from exclusion. The daughter has cerebral palsy, and being left out can be hurtful. The parent might feel that the other children's mother was neglecting to include their daughter, even if it wasn't intentional. However, the parent's reaction was verbal aggression, which could have escalated things and made the other mother defensive. \n\nThe key here is whether the parent's actions were justified. While the intention was good, the method of yelling might not be the most effective or respectful way to address the issue. It's possible that a more constructive approach, like speaking calmly or involving the other mother in a respectful manner, could have been better. However, the parent's reaction was in defense of their child's inclusion, which is a valid concern. \n\nIn some cases, people might argue that standing up for one's child is necessary, but the manner in which it was done matters. Yelling can be seen as aggressive and might not encourage the other party to be receptive to the parent's concerns. The other mother's reaction (storming off) suggests that the approach was off-putting. \n\nAdditionally, the daughter was eventually included, so the parent's intervention had a positive outcome. But the process involved public confrontation, which could have been avoided. The partner's opinion that the parent overreacted is a point to consider, but the parent's perspective is that they were advocating for their child.\n\nSo, balancing the intention to protect the daughter against the method used, the parent might not be entirely in the wrong, but the approach could have been improved. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the answer is B (not in the wrong), it's because the intent was to protect the child. If A (in the wrong), it's because of the yelling. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nI think the correct answer here is B, because the parent was trying to ensure their child isn't excluded, which is a valid concern. The method was harsh, but the intent was good, and sometimes in the heat of the moment, people react strongly to protect their children. However, some might argue that yelling is not appropriate. But given the scenario, the parent's actions were driven by advocacy for their disabled child, which is important. So I lean towards B.\n"
