Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who yelled at the kids' mom for not including their disabled daughter is in the wrong. The situation is that the daughter was watching the kids play, but they didn't include her. The parent yelled at the mother, making comments about being embarrassed and that her daughter isn't poisonous. The daughter ended up being included later.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's intentions. They wanted their child to be included, which is a valid concern. However, the method used was yelling and confronting the other mother harshly. That might be seen as aggressive and possibly shaming. The parent could have approached the kids or the mother more calmly to encourage inclusion. Yelling might have made the situation more uncomfortable and could have been a defensive reaction. However, defending their child's right to be included is understandable. The key is whether the approach was appropriate. While the intent was good, the method might have been too harsh, leading to the other parent leaving. So, the parent might be in the wrong for the way they handled it, even if the concern was valid. Answer A.\n"
