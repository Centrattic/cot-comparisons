Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who yelled at the other mother was in the wrong. The situation involves their disabled daughter not being included in a game by other kids.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspective of the parent. Their daughter was sitting outside watching the kids play, which might have been hurtful. The parent's intention was to advocate for their child's inclusion, which is a valid concern. However, the method used was yelling and making an accusation about the other mother being embarrassed. That could be seen as confrontational and potentially shaming, which might not be effective or appropriate.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent is defending their child's right to be included, which is important. The kids did eventually include the daughter later, so maybe the yelling had some effect. But was yelling the right approach? Publicly confronting another parent could lead to defensiveness and might not teach their daughter the best way to handle social situations. The partner's reaction suggesting it was an overreaction adds another layer\u2014maybe there's a differing opinion on how to handle advocacy.\n\nI need to weigh the intent against the method. Advocating for inclusion is right, but the manner in which it was done might be questionable. The parent's actions could have been more constructive, like talking to the mother calmly or addressing it with the kids. Yelling might escalate tensions and not model the behavior they want their daughter to learn.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author might be in the wrong because the approach was confrontational, even if the intent was good. But there's also the argument that advocating for their child's inclusion is justified. However, the community might lean towards AITA because of the public confrontation and potential shaming involved. So the answer is likely A (in the wrong).\n"
