Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who yelled at the kids' mom is in the wrong. The situation is about a disabled daughter being excluded from play by other kids. The parent yells at the mother, accusing her of being embarrassed and saying the child isn't poisonous.\n\nFirst, consider the intent. The parent's main concern is their daughter's inclusion and well-being. The kids didn't include the disabled child, which is hurtful. The parent's reaction was to confront the mother. But yelling and making an accusation (\"embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid\") might come off as confrontational and possibly offensive. The mother might feel attacked, even if the intent was to protect their daughter.\n\nHowever, the parent's daughter did eventually get included after the incident. The parent's motivation is to advocate for their child's inclusion. But the method\u2014yelling and public confrontation\u2014could have been handled better. Maybe a more direct approach with the kids or a calmer conversation with the mother would have been more effective and less confrontational. The partner's reaction suggests that there's a belief the parent overreacted, which adds another layer.\n\nIs the parent in the wrong? Well, while the intent is good, the method was aggressive. Publicly shaming another parent, even if done to protect one's child, can be seen as inconsiderate. The parent might have wanted to address the exclusion but did so in a way that could escalate the situation. So, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong), because the approach could be seen as inappropriate and potentially harmful, even if the intention was good. But some might argue B (No), because advocating for inclusion is important. However, the line between advocacy and confrontation is thin here, and the method used was yelling and making accusatory comments, which is more likely to alienate than help. So leaning towards A.\n"
