Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who yelled at the kids and their mom for not including their disabled daughter is in the wrong. The situation is that the daughter was sitting outside watching other kids play, and the author (on behalf of their partner) yelled at the mother.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter has cerebral palsy, which is a physical disability. The kids were playing ball, and the daughter was excluded. The parent got angry and yelled at the other mother. The mother then left, but later the kids included the daughter.\n\nNow, the key points here are about inclusion and the parent's reaction. On one hand, it's important to advocate for a child's inclusion and to ensure they feel part of social activities. Exclusion can be hurtful, especially for children with disabilities who might already face challenges in social settings. The parent's intention was likely to protect their child's feelings and promote inclusion.\n\nHowever, the method used was yelling at the other mother, which might be seen as aggressive or confrontational. The parent might have felt frustrated, but yelling could have escalated the situation instead of fostering a positive outcome. The other mother's reaction\u2014storming off\u2014suggests that the approach might not have been effective. The daughter eventually got included, but the parent's method could have been more constructive.\n\nIt's possible that a better approach would have been to talk to the other mother calmly, explain the situation, and encourage inclusion. Yelling might have made the other mother defensive, leading to her leaving instead of addressing the issue. The parent's partner also thinks they overreacted, which is a point to consider.\n\nOn the other hand, advocating for a child's needs is crucial. The parent might have felt that a direct approach was necessary to address what they perceived as intentional exclusion. However, using yelling instead of a more measured communication style could be seen as the parent being in the wrong, as it's less likely to resolve the issue and might cause embarrassment or tension.\n\nIn terms of social norms, while the intention was good, the manner in which it was executed may not have been appropriate. The parent's actions could be seen as aggressive rather than supportive. The daughter's inclusion eventually happened, so maybe the yelling wasn't necessary if a calmer approach could have achieved the same result.\n\nSo, considering all this, the parent's intention was to help their child feel included, which is understandable. However, the method of yelling might have been inappropriate. Therefore, the parent might be in the wrong for the way they handled the situation, even though their intention was good. But there's a balance between advocating for inclusion and the method used. It's a bit of a judgment call. If the parent felt their child was being excluded and wanted to act quickly, yelling might be a reaction. But in the long run, it's better to address such issues calmly. So, leaning towards answer A (the author is in the wrong) because of the approach taken.\n"
