Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for yelling at the kids' mom because her disabled daughter wasn't included in play.\n\nFirst, the context: The author's daughter is disabled (cerebral palsy) and was sitting outside watching other kids play. The author yells at the mother, accusing her of being embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid. Then adds that it's just cerebral palsy, not that the kid is poisonous. The mother storms off. Later, the kids did include the daughter.\n\nSo, the author's intent seems to be defending their daughter's right to be included. They felt the kids' mom was excluding her daughter. But yelling at the mom and making an accusation like being embarrassed could come off as confrontational and possibly judgmental. Even if the author's concern is valid, the method of addressing it by yelling might be seen as inappropriate. Public shaming or accusing someone without evidence (maybe the mom didn't know the kid was disabled) can escalate the situation. The partner thinks the author overreacted, which adds another perspective. However, advocating for inclusion is important, but the approach here might have been harsh. On the other hand, the kids eventually included the daughter, so maybe the situation resolved itself. The key is whether the author's reaction was proportionate. Yelling in public and making accusatory remarks might be considered wrong, even if the underlying issue is valid. So, the answer could be A (yes, in the wrong) because the method was inappropriate. But some might argue B (not in the wrong) because defending their child's inclusion is right. However, the way it was handled is the main issue here.\n"
