Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a parent yelling at another mother's kids for not including their disabled daughter in play. The parent yells out the window, asking if the mother is embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid, and then adds that cerebral palsy isn't contagious. The kids eventually include the daughter, but the parent is being told by their partner that they overreacted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter has a disability, and the parent is upset because the other kids aren't including her. The parent's intent was to protect their child's feelings and ensure inclusion. However, the method used was yelling at the other parent, which could be seen as confrontational. The parent's words might be interpreted as accusatory, which could have escalated the situation instead of solving it. \n\nOn one hand, advocating for a child's inclusion is important, especially if the child is being excluded. The parent might feel that the other mother was not addressing the exclusion, hence the frustration. On the other hand, yelling in public and making accusatory remarks might not be the best approach. It could have made the other mother defensive, leading to a breakdown in communication rather than a solution. \n\nThe key points here are the parent's intent (to protect and include their child) versus the method (confrontational yelling). While the intent is valid, the method might be inappropriate. The parent's partner thinks they overreacted, suggesting that there's room for a more constructive approach, like calmly addressing the issue with the other mother. \n\nHowever, it's also important to consider the parent's emotional state. They might have been emotionally charged, trying to stand up for their child in a moment of stress. But even so, public confrontations can often backfire and may not teach the child the best way to handle such situations. The daughter did eventually get included, but the parent's actions might have caused unnecessary tension with the neighbors.\n\nIn terms of social norms, while advocating for inclusion is right, the way to do it matters. Direct communication or a calmer approach might be more effective. Yelling could be seen as aggressive, even if the intention is good. The other mother's reaction (storming off) indicates that the message was received negatively, which might not lead to the desired outcome of fostering inclusion in the future.\n\nSo, the parent's actions, while stemming from a desire to protect their child, might have been the wrong approach. The answer would lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because the method used was inappropriate, even if the intent was good. However, it's a nuanced situation where the intent is understandable but the execution is questionable.\n"
