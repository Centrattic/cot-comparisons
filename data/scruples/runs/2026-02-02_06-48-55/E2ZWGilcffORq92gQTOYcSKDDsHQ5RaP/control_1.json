Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person is at fault for yelling at kids for not including their disabled daughter in play. The situation is that the author saw two kids playing with their mom nearby, and their daughter was sitting on the veranda but wasn't being included. The author then yelled out to the mother, implying she was embarrassed to play with a disabled child, and the mother didn't respond. The daughter ended up being included later.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author's intention was to include their daughter, which is understandable, especially if the daughter feels left out. However, the method used was yelling at the mother, which might be seen as confrontational. The mother's reaction was to storm off, so maybe she felt attacked. The partner thinks the author overreacted, so there's a conflict in perspectives.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a social standpoint, confronting someone publicly by yelling could be seen as inappropriate, especially if the mother was only present and not necessarily excluding the child. The author might not have known the mother's reasoning for not inviting their daughter. Maybe there were other factors, like the kids being too young or not aware of the situation. Yelling could have made the mother defensive instead of approaching the situation with an open mind.\n\nAlso, the daughter was watching the kids play, but it's unclear if she was invited. The mother might not have realized the child wanted to join. The author's approach might have been too aggressive, potentially making the mother feel blamed rather than approached to help. It's possible that a more diplomatic approach, like calmly talking to the mother or encouraging the daughter to approach the other kids, could have been better. \n\nHowever, the author's concern is about inclusion and the daughter's feelings. They might feel that their child's right to participate is important, and standing up for that is justified. But the method of yelling might have been the issue, not the intent. The answer would depend on balancing the intent (good) with the method (poor). So, while the author's intention is to advocate for their daughter, the way they handled it could be problematic. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because yelling is not the best approach, but some might argue B because the intent was good. Need to check for cultural norms too. In many cases, public confrontation is seen as inappropriate. The mother might have been unaware, so the better approach is to address it respectfully. Hence, the author likely overstepped their bounds by yelling, making them at fault.\n"
