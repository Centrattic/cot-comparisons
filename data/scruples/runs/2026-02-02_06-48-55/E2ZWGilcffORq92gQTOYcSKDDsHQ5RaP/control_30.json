Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who yelled at the kids' mom for not including their disabled daughter is in the wrong. The situation is about a child with cerebral palsy being left out of a play activity.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's daughter was sitting on the veranda, watching the kids play. The mother of the other kids wasn't including her, and when the author confronted the mother, she got a strong reaction. The daughter then moved to another spot, but the kids eventually included her later. The partner thinks the author overreacted.\n\nSo, the key points here are about inclusion and disability. The author's intent was to advocate for their daughter to be included. But the method used was yelling, which might be seen as aggressive. The mother might have had other reasons for not including the kids, maybe thinking the daughter was just observing or that the game wasn't suitable for her. But the daughter has a disability, so maybe the mother was being unintentionally exclusionary.\n\nThe question is whether yelling was the right approach. While the goal of inclusion is important, the method could have been escalated. Yelling can be perceived as confrontational, which might not have helped the situation. The author's words, like \"embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid,\" imply a judgment about the mother's feelings, which might not be fair. The mother might not have been aware of the daughter's presence or the specific need for inclusion. \n\nHowever, advocating for a child's inclusion is valid. The author was trying to ensure their daughter wasn't excluded. The partner's reaction suggests that maybe a calmer approach could have been better. The daughter's eventual inclusion shows that the kids were willing to play with her, so the mother's initial hesitation might have been a misjudgment.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, while the intention was good, the approach of yelling might have been a mistake. It's possible the mother was unaware, and a direct but respectful conversation could have been more effective. Also, the author's assumption that the mother was embarrassed might be incorrect, leading to an unnecessary confrontation. So, even if the author's intent was right, the method could be questioned. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) for the yelling, but the reasoning is more nuanced.\n"
