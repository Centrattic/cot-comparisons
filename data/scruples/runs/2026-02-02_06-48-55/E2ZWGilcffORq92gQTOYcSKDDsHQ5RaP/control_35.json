Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for yelling at the kids and their mom. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe author's daughter has cerebral palsy and was sitting on the veranda watching other kids play ball. The author saw her not being included and then yelled at the mother, asking if she was embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid. Then the author added that the daughter isn't poisonous, which made the mother storm off. The kids later included the daughter, and the partner thinks the author overreacted.\n\nFirst, I should consider the context. The daughter is disabled and was excluded from the game. Exclusion can be hurtful, especially for a child with a disability who might feel left out more easily. The author was concerned about their daughter's inclusion and social interaction. However, the way they addressed the issue was through yelling. Yelling can be seen as aggressive or confrontational, which might not be the best approach, even if the intention is good.\n\nThe author's use of the phrase \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" is accusatory. It's possible that the mother wasn't intentionally excluding the child. Maybe the kids didn't know how to include a peer with cerebral palsy, or there were other factors, like space or the type of game being played. The author made an assumption about the mother's feelings without knowing the full story. That could have been a mistake.\n\nThen, the author says, \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything.\" This statement, while trying to normalize the situation, might come off as dismissive or implying that the mother is being unreasonable. It's important to communicate in a way that doesn't shame others, even if they're acting in a way that's excluding. The mother's reaction was to storm off, which suggests she felt attacked or unfairly judged.\n\nHowever, the author's concern is valid. Children with disabilities often face social challenges, and advocating for their inclusion is important. The partner's perspective is that the author overreacted, but the author's intent was to ensure their daughter wasn't left out. The problem is the approach taken. Yelling might not resolve the issue and could create a hostile environment, potentially making the mother more likely to avoid the situation in the future, which isn't helpful for the daughter's social opportunities.\n\nAn alternative approach might have been to approach the mother calmly, express concern about the daughter's inclusion, and perhaps ask if the kids could be invited to play together or if there's a way to help them understand how to include a child with a disability. That way, the author could have addressed the exclusion without creating a conflict.\n\nSo, while the author's intention to support their daughter's inclusion is understandable and commendable, the method of addressing it through yelling and accusatory statements might be considered inappropriate. The mother might have felt defensive and the situation could have been handled more constructively. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for the way they reacted, even if their motives were good.\n"
