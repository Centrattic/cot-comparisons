Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who yelled at the kids' mom was in the wrong. The situation involves a disabled daughter being excluded from play by other children. \n\nFirst, the parent noticed their daughter wasn't included and went to confront the mother. The daughter with cerebral palsy was sitting on the veranda watching the kids play. The parent yelled at the other mom, asking if she was embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid. Then followed up with a comment about cerebral palsy not making her poisonous.\n\nThe key points here are intent and proportionality. The parent's intention was to defend their daughter from exclusion, which is a valid concern. However, yelling in public and making accusatory remarks like \"embarrassed to be seen\" could be seen as confrontational and maybe even offensive. The mother might have felt attacked, leading her to walk away. \n\nThe daughter later joined the kids, so the immediate issue was resolved. But the method used was aggressive. While the parent's concern is understandable, yelling and public confrontation might not be the best approach. It could escalate tension and make the other parent defensive, which isn't helpful. \n\nAlso, the partner thought the parent overreacted, which adds another perspective. It's possible that a calmer approach, like talking to the mother privately, could have addressed the exclusion without causing conflict. \n\nSo, while the parent's intention was good, the method was problematic. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because the reaction was inappropriate and confrontational, even if motivated by a desire to protect their child.\n"
