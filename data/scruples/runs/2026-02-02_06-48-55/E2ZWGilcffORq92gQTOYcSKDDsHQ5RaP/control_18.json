Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who yelled at the other kids' mom is in the wrong. The situation involves their disabled daughter being excluded by other kids playing.\n\nFirst, the parent saw their daughter sitting alone while the other kids played. They approached the other mom and yelled, asking if she's embarrassed to have a disabled kid. Then added a comment about it being just cerebral palsy. The other mom left, but later the kids did include the daughter.\n\nSo, the key points here: the parent's intention was to defend their daughter, but the method involved yelling and confronting the other mom publicly. Yelling can be seen as aggressive, even if the cause is right. The parent might have valid concern about inclusion, but the way they addressed it could have been more constructive. The other mom's reaction suggests she was taken aback, and maybe the parent's approach could have been hurtful, even if unintended. However, advocating for inclusion is important, especially for a child with disabilities. The parent might have overreacted in their approach, but the underlying issue is valid. The partner thinks they overreacted, which adds another perspective. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the parent's actions were driven by a desire to include their daughter, but the method used was confrontational. It's possible that a better approach would have been to talk to the other mom calmly, explain the situation, and encourage inclusion without yelling. So, the parent might be in the wrong not because the concern is invalid, but because the response was inappropriate. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because yelling and confrontational behavior, even when motivated by a good cause, can be seen as wrong. However, some might argue B (not in the wrong) because they were standing up for their child. But typically, public confrontation with yelling is considered over the line. So, likely answer is A.\n"
