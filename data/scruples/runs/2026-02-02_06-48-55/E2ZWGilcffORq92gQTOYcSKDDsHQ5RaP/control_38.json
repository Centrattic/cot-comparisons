Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who yelled at the kids' mom for not including their disabled daughter is in the wrong. The scenario is that the daughter was sitting outside watching the kids play, and the parent yelled at the mother, saying things like being embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid. The kids eventually included the daughter after that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parent's reaction was out of concern for their daughter not being included. Children with disabilities often face exclusion, so the parent's frustration is understandable. However, the method used was yelling at the other mother, which might be seen as aggressive or confrontational. \n\nOn one hand, advocating for one's child is important. Inclusion is a key value, and the parent might feel that their child's right to participate is being overlooked. On the other hand, yelling in public could be seen as an overreaction. It might escalate the situation and potentially embarrass the other parent, which isn't helpful in fostering a positive environment for the kids to interact.\n\nThe other parent didn't respond, so maybe she was taken aback and didn't know how to react. The daughter did end up being included, so maybe the yelling had the intended effect, but at what cost? It's possible that a calmer approach, like approaching the mother privately to discuss inclusion, might have been more effective and respectful.\n\nAlso, public shaming or yelling can sometimes make people defensive. The parent might have wanted to protect their daughter's feelings, but the method used could have made the other parent feel attacked, which might not encourage future positive interactions.\n\nThe partner's opinion that it was an overreaction is a point to consider. Sometimes a third perspective can highlight the heat of the moment versus a measured response. However, the parent's intention was to advocate for their child, which is a valid concern.\n\nIn terms of social norms, while advocating for inclusion is good, the approach matters. Yelling might not be the best way to model behavior or resolve the situation constructively. There's a balance between standing up for one's child and maintaining a respectful interaction with others.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the parent might be in the wrong for the method used, even if the intention was good. The answer would likely be A, but I need to make sure I'm not missing nuances. Maybe there's a cultural aspect or the parent's past experiences that influenced their reaction, but based on the given info, the immediate reaction's impact is the main point.\n"
