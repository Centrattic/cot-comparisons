Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for yelling at the kids and their mom for not including their disabled daughter. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author's daughter has cerebral palsy and was sitting outside watching other kids play. They noticed that the other kids, whose mom was present, weren't including her. The author then yelled at the mother, asking if she was embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid. Then the author further yelled, saying it's just cerebral palsy and she's not poisonous. The mom left, and later the kids did include the daughter. The partner thinks the author overreacted.\n\nFirst, the intention here is to stand up for their daughter's inclusion. That's understandable. Parents want their kids to feel included and not discriminated against. But the method used was yelling at the other parent, which might have been confrontational. The question is whether that reaction was appropriate.\n\nYelling in public could be seen as aggressive, even if the motive is good. The mother might have been taken aback, and the author's words could have been hurtful or accusatory. The author's daughter did eventually get included, which is positive, but the way it was handled might have caused embarrassment for the other mother or the kids.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's daughter was being excluded despite being present. The author might have felt that the other parent was complicit in the exclusion by not encouraging inclusion. However, confronting the parent in such a public and loud manner could have made the other parent defensive, possibly leading to a worse outcome if the situation escalated.\n\nIt's also important to consider the child's perspective. The daughter was trying to include herself by moving closer, but the other kids didn't respond. The author's intervention might have been the only way to address an immediate situation where their child felt left out. However, the method could have been more constructive, like speaking privately to the mother or encouraging the kids through other means without public confrontation.\n\nIn terms of social norms, yelling at someone in public, even if the intention is good, is often seen as inappropriate. It might have made the other parent feel attacked, which could lead to defensiveness rather than cooperation. The author's statement about the disability, while meant to reassure, might have come across as dismissive or as if the disability isn't a significant issue. However, sometimes parents do use that line to normalize their child's condition in the presence of others.\n\nThe partner's opinion that the author overreacted suggests that there's a common view that the approach was too harsh. The key here is whether the means justified the ends. The daughter was eventually included, but the method of intervention might have had negative social consequences, like making the other parent feel judged, which could affect future interactions in the neighborhood.\n\nIn summary, while the intent to protect and include their daughter is valid, the method of using public yelling might have been inappropriate. The author could have addressed the situation more calmly or through private conversation to encourage inclusion without causing embarrassment or conflict. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for the way they handled the situation, even if the underlying issue was important.\n"
