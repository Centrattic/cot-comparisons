Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this story is in the wrong for yelling at the kids and their mom for not including their disabled daughter in the game. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author's daughter is sitting outside watching other kids play. The other kids are with their mom, and the author yells at the mom, accusing her of being embarrassed to have a disabled kid. Then the author says something about cerebral palsy and the mom leaves. The daughter later joins the kids, who included her after the mom left.\n\nThe author is asking if they're at fault. They think they might be, and the partner also thinks they overreacted. The user thinks the author is in the wrong and wants to know if that's correct.\n\nNow, considering the scenario. The key points here are the daughter being excluded, the parent's reaction. The author's intent was to defend their daughter's right to be included, but they used yelling and accusatory language. Yelling might not be the best approach, especially in a public setting. The mother might have felt attacked, which could explain her storming off. The daughter ended up being included later, so maybe the outcome was positive, but the method was confrontational. \n\nOn one hand, advocating for inclusion is important. On the other, yelling at someone might not be the most effective way. The author's words could have been perceived as shaming the mother, which might not encourage the mother to include the child. Also, the author might not know the full context\u2014perhaps the mother was trying to include the child but it didn't work out, or maybe the child didn't want to join. Assuming the worst (embarrassment) could be unfair.\n\nThe partner's reaction that they overreacted suggests that even from within the household, the approach was seen as too harsh. The author could have approached the mother calmly, asked if the daughter could join, and maybe explained if there was a reason for exclusion. Yelling might have made the situation worse, even if the intention was good.\n\nSo, balancing intent and action. The intent was positive, but the method was aggressive. The author might have the right to be upset about their child being excluded, but yelling in public and accusing the mother of embarrassment is a strong response. Therefore, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong because of the confrontational approach, even if the underlying issue is valid.\n"
