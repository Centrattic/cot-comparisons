Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who yelled at the kids and their mom for not including their disabled daughter is in the wrong. The situation is that the daughter was sitting on the veranda watching other kids play, and the parent got angry and yelled at the mother.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the motivations. The parent's daughter has cerebral palsy, and they wanted her included. The parent felt that the other kids and their mother were excluding her. But the mother didn't approach the situation directly; instead, they yelled, which might have been confrontational.\n\nWas the exclusion intentional? The description says the kids were playing in the cul-de-sac, and the daughter was watching. Maybe the other kids didn't realize she was there or didn't know how to include her. Kids sometimes don't understand disabilities or how to interact with someone who's different. The mother might not have noticed the daughter, or if she did, she didn't make an effort to include her. But yelling publicly could have been hurtful to both the mother and the daughter.\n\nThe parent's reaction was to yell, which is a strong approach. They asked if the mother was embarrassed, which is a personal and accusatory question. Then they made a comment about the daughter not being poisonous, which might have been meant to defend her but could come off as defensive or aggressive. The mother left, and the daughter followed, but then the kids included her later. So the yelling might have achieved the desired result, but the method was questionable.\n\nIs yelling the appropriate way to enforce inclusion? Maybe not. A better approach could have been to talk to the mother privately, explain the situation, and encourage inclusion without confrontation. Yelling in public could have made the other mother defensive, leading her to withdraw rather than engage.\n\nAlso, the parent's partner thinks they overreacted. The daughter did eventually get included, so perhaps the parent's intention was good, but the method was poor. The question is whether the parent is in the wrong. Since they used yelling and public confrontation, which might not be the best way to handle the situation, the answer could be A. But there's a valid point about wanting to include a child with a disability. However, the method is what's being judged here. So the parent's intentions are good, but the actions were inappropriate. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
