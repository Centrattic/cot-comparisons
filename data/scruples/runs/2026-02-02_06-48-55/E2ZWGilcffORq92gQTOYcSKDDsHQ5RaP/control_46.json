Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who yelled at the mother for not including their disabled daughter in play is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The daughter has cerebral palsy and was sitting by the driveway watching other kids play. The author yelled at the mother and made a comment about being embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid. Then followed up with a remark about her not being poisonous. The mother left, and the kids eventually included the daughter.\n\nNow, the key points here are the author's actions. Yelling at someone, even if the intention is good, is pretty confrontational. The mother might have had her reasons for not including the kids, maybe the kids were too young, or the mother was uncomfortable. But the author's approach was aggressive. Instead of approaching the situation calmly, perhaps by talking to the mother or the kids to encourage inclusion, they chose to yell and make accusatory statements. \n\nAlso, considering that the daughter was able to go back out and play after the incident, it shows that the kids were willing to include her once the situation was over. The mother's reaction might have been due to the yelling rather than her own prejudice. The partner's opinion is that the author overreacted, which suggests some social judgment that the reaction was too harsh.\n\nHowever, defending the inclusion of a disabled child is important. The author's intent was to advocate for their daughter, which is valid. But the method used was confrontational. There's a difference between advocating and being aggressive. The author might not be in the wrong in terms of intent, but the way they handled it could be problematic.\n\nIn terms of social norms, yelling can be seen as rude regardless of the cause. The mother might have felt attacked, leading her to leave. The author should have addressed the issue in a more constructive way. So, even if the intention was good, the action was inappropriate. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
