Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for yelling at some kids for not including their disabled daughter. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The daughter is sitting outside watching other kids play. The parent yells at the mother, implying she's embarrassed to be seen with a disabled child. Then the parent continues by saying the daughter isn't poisonous. The kids later include her, and the partner thinks the parent overreacted.\n\nHmm, the parent's intention was to protect their daughter, right? They wanted her to be included. But yelling at the other mother might have been the wrong approach. The kids weren't necessarily excluding her on purpose; maybe they just didn't realize. The parent assumed the mother's intent, which could be a misjudgment. Maybe the mother didn't see the daughter or didn't know how to include her. Yelling might have escalated the situation instead of helping. The daughter ended up being included later, so maybe the parent's actions caused the mother to retreat, but the kids eventually included her. The parent's methods were confrontational, which might not have been the best way to encourage inclusion. Even if the intent was good, the method could be questionable. So, the parent might be in the wrong for how they handled it, even if their concern was valid.\n"
