Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who yelled at other kids for not including their disabled daughter is in the wrong. The scenario is that the mother saw her daughter sitting alone while other kids were playing and intervened by yelling at the other kids' mom. The daughter was eventually included later.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mother's intention was to include her disabled daughter, which is a valid concern. Kids might not be aware of how to include someone with disabilities, especially if they're young. The mother's frustration is understandable because she wants her child to feel included and not excluded because of her condition.\n\nHowever, the method she used\u2014yelling at the other mother\u2014might be problematic. Publicly confronting someone in that manner could be seen as aggressive or accusatory. The other mother might have felt embarrassed or defensive, even if there was no malicious intent. It's possible that the kids didn't realize they were excluding her daughter, so a more constructive approach might have been better. For example, explaining to the kids that inviting everyone to play is important or speaking to the other mother privately to address the situation without shaming her.\n\nThe daughter did end up being included after the incident, which shows that the outcome was positive, but the method used could have affected the other family's feelings. The partner thinks the mother overreacted, which adds another perspective. While the mother's actions stem from a place of wanting inclusion for her child, the way she handled it might not have been the best approach. So, there's a balance between advocating for her daughter and respecting the other parent's feelings.\n\nIn conclusion, the mother's intentions are good, but the method of yelling might be considered inconsiderate. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because the approach used was inappropriate even if the intent was valid.\n"
