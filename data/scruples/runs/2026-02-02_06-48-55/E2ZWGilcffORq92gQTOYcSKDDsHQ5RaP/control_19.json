Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for yelling at some kids and their mom for not including their disabled daughter in play. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author's daughter has cerebral palsy and was sitting on the veranda watching other kids play. The author yelled at the mother, implying she was embarrassed to be seen with a disabled child. The mother didn't respond, and later the kids included the daughter.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author's intention was to advocate for their daughter's inclusion. But they did it by yelling at the mother, which could be seen as confrontational. Was there a better way to handle it? Maybe approaching the mother calmly and asking them to include the child instead of yelling. \n\nBut the mother didn't include the child initially, so the author felt the need to act. However, yelling might have made the mother defensive, leading her to leave. Then the daughter eventually got included after the author left. \n\nNow, considering the possible responses. The author's actions were meant to protect their child's feelings and ensure inclusion, which is understandable. However, the method used might be considered aggressive. The mother might have been embarrassed by the yelling, leading her to leave, but the kids ended up including the daughter. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for yelling? It's a tough call. On one hand, advocating for inclusion is right, but the approach could be questioned. On the other hand, maybe the author felt their child was being excluded and acted out of frustration. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at intent vs. impact. The intent was good, but the impact could have been negative. However, the resolution was positive in the end. Also, the partner thinks the author overreacted. \n\nI think the answer would be B (No), because the intention was to protect their child's inclusion, and while yelling wasn't ideal, the author's actions were driven by a desire to help their daughter. However, there's a counterargument that yelling is not the best approach. But given the context of a parent defending their child from exclusion, it's a complex situation where the author might not be in the wrong.\n"
