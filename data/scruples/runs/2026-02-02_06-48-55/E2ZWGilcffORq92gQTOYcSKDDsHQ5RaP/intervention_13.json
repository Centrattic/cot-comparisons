Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who yelled at the kids' mother is in the wrong. The situation involves their disabled daughter not being included in a game.\n\nFirst, the author saw their daughter sitting alone while other kids played. They went outside, told their partner, but the partner didn't see an issue. Then the author yelled at the mother, questioning her embarrassment and even said it's just cerebral palsy. The mother left, but eventually the kids included the daughter.\n\nThe key points here are the method of addressing the situation. Yelling at the mother was confrontational and public. While the intent was to protect their daughter's feelings and promote inclusion, the approach might have been inappropriate. Confronting someone in a public setting with accusatory language can be seen as aggressive. It's possible the mother was unaware or had a reason the kids weren't including the daughter, or maybe she felt embarrassed herself, but yelling might not be the best way to handle it. The partner's reaction suggests that they felt it was excessive. On the other hand, advocating for inclusion is important, but the method matters. There might be a better way to approach the mother privately to discuss inclusion without embarrassing her. So, while the intent is understandable, the action might be considered wrong because of the confrontational approach.\n"
