Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So the situation is that their daughter has a disability, and they saw other kids playing while their daughter was sitting alone. The parent yelled at the other mom, asking if she was embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid, then said something about cerebral palsy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parent's daughter was excluded from playing with the other kids. The parent was upset because their child felt left out, maybe even because of her disability. They wanted the other kids to include her. But instead of approaching the other mom calmly, they yelled. That part is important because yelling can be seen as aggressive, even if the intention was to advocate for their daughter.\n\nThe parent's actions led to the other mom leaving, which might have been hurtful. Even if the parent's intention was to protect their daughter's feelings and ensure inclusion, the method used was confrontational. The daughter did eventually get included, so maybe the outcome was positive, but the way it happened could have been handled better.\n\nIs it ever okay to yell in such situations? It depends on cultural norms and personal boundaries. However, in most cases, yelling might escalate the situation and prevent a constructive resolution. The parent might have felt the need to stand up for their child, especially if they perceive that others are excluding her due to her disability. But confronting someone in a public place with harsh words can be seen as inconsiderate, even if the underlying issue is about inclusion.\n\nAlso, the parent's partner thinks they overreacted. That's a point to consider because the partner was present and might have a different perspective on the situation. The parent might have felt that their child's social needs were being ignored, leading to frustration and a loss of temper.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the parent's intention was to advocate for their daughter, which is understandable. However, the method of yelling could be seen as inappropriate. The other mom might have had no intention of excluding the daughter, or maybe the exclusion was innocent. Yelling might not address the root issue and could create a hostile environment.\n\nSo, the parent is not entirely in the wrong because their motivation was to protect their child's inclusion. However, the approach was flawed. The answer might be a mix of both, but since the question asks for a choice between A (yes) or B (no), the best answer would be B (no), because the parent's actions were driven by a desire to protect their child, even if the method was not ideal. But some might argue A (yes) because yelling is not the best way to handle the situation. I need to weigh these aspects.\n"
