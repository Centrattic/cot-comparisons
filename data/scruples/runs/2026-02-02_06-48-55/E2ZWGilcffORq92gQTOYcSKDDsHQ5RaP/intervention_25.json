Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who yelled at the kids' mom for not including their disabled daughter is in the wrong. The scenario is that the daughter was sitting outside watching the kids play, and the parent yelled at the mother to confront her about excluding the child.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from both sides. The parent's intention was to advocate for their daughter's inclusion, which is a valid concern. However, the method used was yelling, which can be aggressive. The mother might have had a reason for not including the kids, maybe they were strangers or there was a safety issue, but the parent didn't ask or explain their concern calmly. \n\nYelling can escalate situations and might have been embarrassing for the other mother. Even if the parent's motive was good, the approach could have been more constructive. The daughter eventually got included, but the conflict might have been avoided with a different approach. The partner's opinion that it was an overreaction might hold weight here. \n\nThe key points are: the parent's right to advocate for their child vs. the method of confrontation. While the intent was to protect their daughter, yelling might not be the most effective or respectful way. So, the parent might be in the wrong for the reaction, even if the underlying issue is valid.\n"
